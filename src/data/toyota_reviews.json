    "full_description": "SR5 models have new 16-inch wheels, and a limited-slip differential is available on V8-powered trucks. No other changes are in store for the 2002 Toyota Tundra. The 2002 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup suited more for the general consumer than for commercial use. Since Toyota is the maker of America's best-selling sedan, it must have been frustrating for the company in the '90s to see domestic automakers reaping huge benefits from full-size pickups, especially since the closest thing to a full-size pickup truck previously offered by Toyota was the poorly received T100. But the company learned from its mistakes, and the result is the full-fledged maximum-sized Tundra.Now three years into its current life cycle, the Tundra is capable of running with the big dogs. Though smaller than most V8s in this class, the smooth-revving and ultra-refined 4.7-liter makes 245 horsepower and 315 pound-feet of torque and is available only with a four-speed automatic transmission. Payload capacity is 2,000 pounds and towing capacities for the V8 start at 5,000 pounds (it goes up to 7,000 pounds with an optional tow package). A 3.4-liter dual overhead-cam V6, making 190 hp and 220 lb-ft of torque, is standard on regular-cab Tundras, and may be mated to either a four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual transmission.Toyota has failed, in some regards, to meet the demands of current truck buyers when it comes to configuration. The Tundra is available in regular and extended-cab versions. Unfortunately, regular-cab versions come only in longbed form, while extended-cab models come only as shortbeds. The latter does include two \"suicide\" doors for easier rear-seat access (which, by the way, is what Toyota calls its four-door Tundra layout: Access Cab), but the space back there is smaller in comparison to that of trucks from Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge and GMC. Those domestic truck-makers also let the buyer build a pickup to meet specific style and creature comfort needs, ranging from bare-bones work trucks to luxury-lined haulers. Toyota gives you three trim levels and a comparatively sparse option list, though dealers will likely be happy to load you up with running boards and gold packages if given the chance.Inside, the Tundra feels a bit more compact than its American counterparts, lacking adequate seat-track travel and a seat height adjuster (in the volume-leading SR5 Access Cab) for optimal comfort when taller drivers are behind the wheel. Rear seat room is also tight, with legroom at a premium for anyone of average height. Tundra's cabin does offer a quiet ride that surpasses competing trucks, as well as many cars, and options like leather seating and a CD changer further contribute to the Tundra's relaxing internal environment for shorter folks. But interior plastics come straight from the Corolla parts bin, and many have a cheap feel and luster that no amount of cowhide can mask. We wish Toyota offered more variety in areas like configuration and option packages, and an increase in cab space would help the Tundra compete better with the extended cab models from GM, Ford and Dodge. Still, the fact that a V8-powered pickup can now be had with a Toyota nameplate on it means that there's a new sub-set of rules for America's truck buyer.",

    "full_description": "The 1998 four-wheel-drive Tacomas receive fresh front-end styling that makes them more closely resemble their two-wheel-drive brothers. A new option package appears for 1998 as well; the TRD Off-Road Package for extended cab models is offered. On the safety front, Toyota introduces a passenger-side airbag that can be deactivated with a cut-off switch, making the Tacoma somewhat safer for children and short adults. Toyota also offers a new Tacoma PreRunner for 1998, billing it as a two-wheel-drive truck with four-wheel-drive performance. Toyota's sixth-generation compact pickup debuted as a 1995.5 model with an actual model name: Tacoma. It's supposed to suggest the rugged outdoors, as well as strength and adventure. Any of three potent engines go under the hood.  Toyota aimed for aggressive styling, inside and out, and Tacomas sport an excellent selection of interior fittings. Regular and extended cab bodies are available, with either two- or four-wheel drive. A freshening of the front end occurred on the 1997 two-wheel drive Tacoma and the 1998 four-wheel drive models follow this year. Swoopy fenders, a larger bumper, aero-style headlamps and a new grille set this truck apart from its forebears.  Two-wheel drive Tacomas get a 2.4-liter four-cylinder base engine, rated at 142-horsepower. Tacoma 4x4s earn a 150-horsepower, 2.7-liter four. Toyota claims that its four-cylinder engines are comparable to V6s from competitors. If those won't suffice, however, consider the V6 option: a dual-overhead-cam, 24-valve unit that whips out 190 horses and 220 foot-pounds of torque. With V6 power, borrowed from the bigger T100, this compact pickup can tow up to 5,000 pounds and soundly trounce most factory sport trucks in the stoplight dragrace.  All Tacomas have front coil springs instead of the former torsion bars, but 4x4s feature longer suspension travel to improve ride/handling qualities. Manual-shift trucks feature reverse-gear synchronization to reduce gear noise when shifting into reverse. Four-wheel antilock braking is optional on all Tacomas, and all pickups contain dual airbags with a shut-off switch for the passenger's side. In top-of-the-line Limited pickups, a One-Touch Hi-Four switch is available for easy, pushbutton engagement of four-wheel drive.  Tacomas are produced at the NUMMI joint-venture facility in Fremont, Calif., having been designed in that state. Options include cruise control, air conditioning, a sliding rear window, tilt steering wheel and moonroof.  The 1998 Tacoma PreRunner, however,  is set to attract truck buyers who desire but cannot afford a 4WD truck, 4WD truck owners who don't use their 4WD as often as they expected and 2WD truck buyers who take their vehicle off-road. Historically, a \"pre-runner\" is a truck that pre-runs an off-road race course. Toyota's new PreRunner has benefitted from considerable suspension tuning and development work with Toyota Motorsports  desert racing truck program to produce a 2WD vehicle with 4WD capabilities.  Stylistically, the PreRunner is identical to the other 1998 4WD Tacoma trucks, but the PreRunners are only available as XtraCab models with four- or six-cylinder automatic transmissions.  Special details on the PreRunners include a double-wishbone independent suspension with coil springs, a 1.02-inch stabilizer bar and hydraulic shock absorbers.  Standard tires are 15- by six-inch steel wheels and P225/75R15 mud and snow tires.  The Toyota Racing Development off-road package offers Bilstein shock absorbers, locking rear differential on six-cylinder models, alloy wheels and other off-road enhancements.  Toyota  hopes to attract buyers with the style and image of their Tacoma as well as a lower price tag.  We like the Tacoma, but question the value it represents. Most of these Toyota trucks don't come cheap.  Guess that's the price you pay for the peace of mind a Toyota provides.",

An engine immobilizer feature is now part of the theft-deterrent package. The Camry is the new standard for midsized sedans.  It has room inside for five adults, attractive yet conservative styling, exceptional pep from an available 24-valve 3.0-liter V6 and a price that doesn't break the bank so long as options are kept to a minimum.  Last year, Toyota redesigned their midsize sedan and decided to go after the number one sales spot with vigor.  At the end of the model year, sales showed that Toyota had the numbers to become the best-selling car in America.  New and old Toyota customers have fallen in love with the Camry because of its reliability, durability and good value.  The new Camry can be equipped for rugged family life, or plush luxury touring.  Options on higher-grade LE and XLE models include a premium sound system, leather interior trim and a power moonroof.  With the V6 engine, the Camry accelerates strongly.  Braking is swift and sure with the antilock system, and Camry hangs on well in corners despite rather meek all-season radials.  Inside, a two-inch increase in wheelbase has allowed designers to maximize space, creating a larger Camry than the 1996 model.  Controls and gauges are laid-out nicely in a flowing dashboard, and most secondary controls are within easy reach of the driver.  We are big fans of the fingertip cruise control stalk that allows easy operation without the chance of inadvertent activation.  Camry CE sticks with a fixed-mast stereo antenna, but LE and XLE get an in-glass antenna, which reduces wind noise.  Storage areas are abundant and feature a deep center console, door bins, and dashboard bins.  Front cupholders accommodate 20-ounce bottles of your favorite beverage.  Is the Camry the perfect family conveyance?  Not out of the box, but it's close.  We'd opt for a lightly loaded CE with the V6 engine, add some aftermarket alloy wheels, and do a bit of suspension and tire work to create the ultimate sleeper of staid bread-and-butter sedans.",

    "full_description": "Toyota's SUV receives minor changes. The most noticeable is the addition of the 2WD Limited to the model lineup. SR5 models receive new interior fabrics. After a successful five-year run, the second-generation Toyota 4Runner has been retired, and not a moment too soon.  Fresh in 1990, the 4Runner aged quickly as the sport utility market exploded and other automakers introduced larger, safer and more powerful rivals.  By 1995, the compact pickup-based 4Runner offered little, other than Toyota's reputation for reliability, to entice buyers.For 1996, Toyota has separated this high-volume SUV from its pickup truck roots.  The new 4Runner shares little with the Tacoma pickup.  As a result, engineers have created a more refined vehicle without sacrificing tough off-road ability.  Suspension travel and tread width are both up to improve off-road ability, ride, and handling.  The interior is larger in every direction, thanks to a wheelbase that is two inches longer than the previous version.  A lower floor and wider doors make getting into and out of the 4Runner less of an exercise in contortionism.  Rear leg room is up by three inches, and cargo space has been improved as well.Two engines are available on the 4Runner; a 2.7-liter inline four cylinder that makes 150 horsepower at 4800 rpm and 177 foot-pounds of torque at 4000 rpm., and a 3.4-liter V6 producing 183 horsepower at 4800 rpm and 217 foot-pounds of torque at 3600 rpm.  These figures represent a substantial improvement over the old anemic four cylinder and wheezy V6 -- in fact, the new 2.7-liter four is more powerful than the 1995 model's 3.0-liter six.Needless to say, all of this adds up to a much improved sport-ute.  Safety hasn't been ignored in the revamped 4Runner, which sports dual airbags.  Antilock brakes are standard with the V6 and optional on four cylinder models.  Steering response and feel have also been improved by replacing the old recirculating ball-type steering with a rack and pinion setup.  Access to the cargo area is improved by switching from a two-piece tailgate to a one-piece hatch-style liftgate with a power-down rear window.Also new are 20-ounce cupholders, a bigger console storage area, and relocated rear speakers.  Seven new exterior colors debut, and all new interior fabrics and designs round out the new 4Runner package.  Overall, a very nice effort, resulting in a tough truck with looks to match.  Pricing runs from $20,000 for a 2WD four cylinder Base model to $36,000 for a fully loaded Limited.  This lands the 4Runner right smack dab in Tahoe, Explorer and Grand Cherokee territory.

In 1996, Toyota separated this high-volume SUV from its pickup-truck roots. Thus, the current 4Runner shares little with the Tacoma pickup. As a result, engineers have created a refined vehicle without sacrificing tough off-road ability. In terms of Toyota's lineup, the 4Runner is more expensive than the Tacoma, but less expensive than the Land Cruiser.The interior is quite roomy, and a low floor and wide doors make getting into and out of the 4Runner less of an exercise in contortionism. Gauges are clearly marked and legible. 4Runner Limiteds receive walnut wood inserts on the dash, though this can also be gained on base and SR5 models through an option package. Toyota has thoughtfully provided rear passengers with heat and air conditioning ducts that can be operated independently to adjust fan speed and temperature.There are two engines available on the 4Runner. The base model is propelled by a 2.7-liter inline four cylinder that makes 150 horsepower at 4,800 rpm and 177 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000 rpm. Both the SR5 and Limited models receive a 3.4-liter V6, producing 183 horsepower at 4,800 rpm and 217 foot-pounds of torque at 3,600 rpm. While the V6's numbers are acceptable, both the Ford Explorer and Jeep Grand Cherokee have optional V8 engines that produce considerably more horsepower and torque. Suspension-wise, the 4Runner is near the top of the pack. An optional locking rear differential (4WD models only) allows for effortless trips off highway, and the 4Runner is equally at home cruising suburban asphalt, but you'd better like a somewhat harsh ride.Overall, the 4Runner is a nice truck which provides the sophistication that we have come to expect from Toyota products with the overall ruggedness more often associated with Jeeps. Prices are high, however, running from approximately $22,500 for a 2WD four-cylinder base model to over $37,000 for a fully loaded Limited. This lands the top 4Runner right smack dab in Mercedes-Benz ML320, Lexus RX300, and Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited territory. The competition in this segment is getting fierce and there are plenty of good choices for your money, definitely something worth considering when shelling out such a large chunk of change.",

    "full_description": "Toyota's mini-SUV receives just a couple cosmetic changes this year. Models ordered with the Quick Order package now have gray-painted bumpers and overfenders, and Toyota has added color-keyed bumpers and overfenders to the \"L\" package. There are also three new L package colors: Rainforest Pearl, Spectra Blue Mica and Pearl White (Natural White and Vintage Gold have been discontinued). A solid and pleasing package, if a tad bit small. Back in 1996, the term \"cute-ute\" was coined when Toyota released the RAV4, an acronym for Recreational Activity Vehicle with 4WD. While Suzuki had been plying these waters for years with the Sidekick (and its Chevy Tracker twin), it wasn't until the car-based RAV hit the market that small SUVs became popular.The latest RAV4 was redesigned just last year. Available as a five-door wagon only, it has a refined new look thanks to sharply upswept headlights and crisp lines that stretch the length of the vehicle. Squint hard enough, and Toyota's new mini-ute could even pass for a poor man's BMW X5, sans the neck-snapping V8, of course.Powering the RAV4 is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers 148 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 142 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm, a significant improvement over its predecessor, but still far below the 200 horsepower offered in the Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute. Buyers can choose between a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission driving the front or all wheels.Standard equipment is sparse, with most of the good stuff like antilock brakes, aluminum wheels, air conditioning, remote keyless entry and a power sunroof optional. An option package bundles power windows, doors and locks with air conditioning, cruise control and a six-speaker sound system with both cassette and CD players. Upgrade to the \"L\" package and you get these goodies plus heated exterior mirrors, floor mats, dark tinted glass, foglights and special exterior trim. The \"L\" package is also your ticket to leather upholstery. A limited-slip differential is a stand-alone option on 4WD versions.Even with 4WD, the RAV4 isn't meant for serious off-road excursions. Where the RAV4 really shines is on the pavement, where its taut suspension, quick steering, and tight turning radius come together to produce one of the best-handling SUVs we've ever driven. Minimal body lean and sticky street tires combined with the traction of 4WD provide reassuring handling in almost all situations.The passenger cabin is another area where the redesigned RAV scores points. Simple and straightforward climate controls are a snap to use, and the radio is placed nice and high for quick access. Other thoughtful design elements include adjustable cupholders and well-placed storage bins. There's plenty of room for four passengers, but throw in a fifth and things get a little tight.Toyota rarely skimps when it comes to safety features, and the RAV4 is no exception. Dual front airbags are standard along with ALR/ELR seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force-limiters. Side airbags aren't available, but the RAV4 has faired well in government crash tests. One item of note is the RAV4's lack of a rear bumper. Low-speed crashes that damage the rear of the vehicle can lead to extremely high repair costs.Overall, we find Toyota's latest RAV4 to be a fun-to-drive sport-utility that makes a terrific urban runabout. The smooth-revving engine can be noisy, but it returns high fuel mileage, and the precise suspension tuning transmits a confident feeling of control at all times. If these are traits that appeal to you, by all means, give the RAV4 serious consideration.",

    "full_description": "Not much has changed this year for Toyota's truck-based 4Runner SUV. The SR5's optional Sport package has gained a front skid plate, floor mats and new tube step-up bars (optional). Handsome 15-inch alloy wheels are now standard, there's a new chrome package available, and Golden Pearl has been added to the Limited's selection of exterior colors. A likeable SUV that reminds you, for better or for worse, of its truck-based origins. In the seven years since the current 4Runner debuted, the segment of the marketplace in which it competes has exploded in popularity and become littered with fine sport-utes. Yet, Toyota's rugged entry continues to represent an excellent choice, despite its age and distinctly truck-like underpinnings.That's right. If you're looking for a tall car, the 4Runner is likely to disappoint with its stiff ride and general lack of road feel. But if it's a roomy vehicle made for serious off-road work, combined with creature comforts and a solid reputation for reliability, that you're after, then you've come to the right place.Buyers can choose between the standard SR5 or luxurious Limited trim, both of which can be had in either two- or four-wheel drive (the Limited comes with a full-time 4WD system). A 3.4-liter dual overhead-cam V6, attached to a four-speed automatic transmission, makes 183 horsepower at 4,800 rpm and 216 pound-feet of torque at 3,600. It's adequate, but you'll likely find yourself wishing for more go-power.Inside, passengers -- once they manage to clamber aboard -- are greeted by a chunky, purposeful dash that wasn't so much styled as it was pieced together. No matter, it works from an ergonomic standpoint. Seating is comfortable and supportive front and rear, with backseat riders benefiting from plenty of legroom. Cloth upholstery in the SR5 Sport is abrasive, but the Limited has far more pleasing leather hides covering the seats.Along with the leather, the Limited also comes with standard features like fake wood trim, heated power driver and passenger seats, automatic climate control and a CD player. These items can't be ordered on the SR5, but there is a Sport package that adds a fender-blistered, hood-scooped, monochromatic exterior treatment on the outside with larger brakes, bigger alloy wheels, a front skid plate and a performance-oriented rear differential underneath.All 4Runners come standard with Vehicle Skid Control (VSC), traction control and ABS enhanced with electronic brake force distribution and brake assist. VSC is a stability control system that helps keep the truck under control when a lateral, or sideways, skid is detected. Brake assist can apply maximum braking power under emergency situations quicker than the driver can.Cargo capacity measures 44.6 cubic feet with the rear seat in use and 79.8 cubic feet with it folded. Able to tow 5,000 pounds when properly equipped, the 4Runner excels off-road, with as much as 11 inches of ground clearance when the optional P265/70R16 tires are selected. A slick, powered rear window in the hatch, combined with the large, optional sunroof and lowered side glass, results in an open, airy vehicle -- much like a convertible, but not.The 4Runner is nevertheless a truck for people who like trucks. Stout and sturdy, rugged inside and out and boasting excellent crash-test scores from both government and industry entities, this SUV, like most other Toyotas, can take whatever you throw at it.",

    "full_description": "For the 2001 Toyota Corolla, the midgrade CE trim replaces entry-level VE, top-line LE replaces midgrade CE and a sporty new CE-based S model debuts. Front and rear lighting is restyled, and the fascia up front is tweaked and now includes a chrome-ringed grille. An internal trunk release has been added, along with a push-button fresh/recirculate control for the ventilation system. Two new colors replace an equal number of shades that are fading away. Reliable but bland, the 2001 Toyota Corolla is a conservative pick in the economy sedan class. Toyota's venerable Corolla has gone through many changes since it was first introduced in 1968. Over the course of its long life, the Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan. The world has seen enough people fall in love with this car to make it the best-selling nameplate in the history of automobiles. Now, while that's neat and all, we're sure that what's really important to you and your wallet is whether this modern Corolla still has what it takes to stomp out its competitors. In short, it doesn't.Dating to 1998, the current Corolla faces stiff competition from the Ford Focus, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Mazda Protege, and Nissan Sentra, all of which have been substantially redesigned or newly introduced since this particular Toyota was fresh out of the blocks. And they are all more satisfying cars. To help fend them off until the next redesign, the Corolla comes equipped with a zippy, smooth-revving, 1.8-liter, four-cylinder aluminum engine that cranks out 125 horsepower, thanks to a variable valve timing and lift system that Toyota calls VVT-i. VVT-i employs continuously variable intake valve timing to provide greater engine performance, better fuel economy and reduced pollution over a wide rev range. When equipped with a manual transmission, this car pulls strongly. Automatic gearboxes are available too, including a technologically advanced (Not!) three-speed unit on base models.Three trim levels are available on the slightly restyled 2001 Corolla. Base CE, better-equipped LE, and sporty S. The new S model includes \"sporty\" trim, fog lights, fake leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a tachometer with outside temperature display, among other things.This year, Toyota is also freshening the exterior styling in a bid to draw buyers into showrooms. Changes include a revised front end with chrome-ringed grille, new headlights and taillights, and body-colored trim for LE and S models. Impulse Red and Indigo Ink replace Venetian Red Pearl and Twilight Blue Pearl on the color palette. Inside, a button has been added to control fresh/recirculated airflow, and in the trunk, and an internal release handle keeps kids from getting trapped.Our biggest gripe with the Corolla is minimal legroom for both the driver and passengers, and the horribly uncomfortable seats. Center stack ergonomics also aren't up to standards in the class, and the soft suspension keels over in turns, making the tires howl in pain. But the ride is smooth, the cabin is quiet at speed, side airbags are an unusual option for the class, and the parts used in the car's construction exude quality.Few competitors can match Toyota's run-forever reputation and high levels of build quality. But with lots of better cars competing for slices of the econo-sedan pie, Toyota has its work cut out for it in 2001. Especially since the Chevrolet Prizm, an identical twin of the Corolla, is sold with big, fat, juicy rebates at the Chevy dealer down the street.",

Additionally, the five-speed manual transmission has been revised for a better feel and more positive gear engagement. Toyota has a winner with the Corolla; after 28 years of production it has become the second best-selling car in automotive history.  We feel that this is due to its solid engineering, available saffety features, and fun-to-drive attributes when equipped with a five-speed manual transmisson. The Corolla is a fine car with good handling characteristics, a well-designed interior, and attractive, if not earth-shattering, looks.  Additionally, the optional antilock brakes, better than average crash test scores and integrated child seat go a long way toward making a safe compact family-sedan that is not too expensive.Unfortunately for Toyota, there is a good reason to skip th Corolla when shopping for a new car; the Geo Prizm.  Built on the same assembly line as the Corolla, out of the same parts and by the same workers, the Prizm is everything that the Corolla is and more.  Most importantly the Prizm is signifigantly cheaeper than the Corolla and comes with a roadside assistance warranty that the Corolla lacks.  We like the Corolla, but, unless we needed a station wagon, we would buy the Prizm.",

And while the interior and  styling have changed over the years, the Prius' retains its fuel-sipping  tendencies, which are even better in the Prius Prime. \nWith  the regular Prius, you can only fill up its gas tank. But what if you could  separately recharge its battery pack for even better efficiency? The Prius  Prime answers that question. It has a bigger battery and can drive in full  all-electric mode for 25 miles or so. For many people, that's more than enough  for around-town driving. Once the battery is depleted, the Prius' hybrid  powertrain takes over and delivers excellent fuel efficiency.\nWe  also like that Toyota has addressed a couple of issues on the 2020 Prius Prime.  It now has a rear bench seat with a fifth seat and comes standard with Apple  CarPlay and Amazon Alexa. The latter is an appealing substitute to Toyota's  native Entune infotainment system. \nThere  are still a couple of downsides, including tepid acceleration and a small cargo  area. But on the whole, the Prius Prime is worth checking out if you're  shopping for an affordable and efficient plug-in hybrid.\nNotably, we picked the 2020 Toyota Prius Primeas one of Edmunds' Cheapest Electric Cars and Best Gas Mileage Cars for 2020. All  Prius Prime models feature the same powertrain and basic layout, so opt for the XLE trim. It gives you a decent set  of extra features while keeping the price reasonable. Its notable add-ons  compared to the base LE are its standard navigation system, larger touchscreen,  simulated leather upholstery and a wireless smartphone charger.",

    "full_description": "Initially offered as a single specification with no factory options, Toyota's advanced gasoline/electric hybrid now offers a choice of several new options for 2002. These include a navigation system, cruise control, side airbags and daytime running lights. There are also two new colors: Brilliant Blue and Blue Moon Pearl. Currently, the 2002 Toyota Prius is the best hybrid on the market, but watch for the upcoming hybrid Civic. With fuel prices hovering around $2 a gallon, hybrid vehicles have been getting increased attention from the American public. Hybrid cars combine a gasoline engine with an electric motor. Since hybrids are still fueled by gasoline, they don't have to be plugged in or recharged. The result of hybrid technology is reduced emissions and improved fuel efficiency when compared to a normal gasoline-powered car. There are currently two available for mass consumption: the Honda Insight and the Toyota Prius. While the Insight gets amazing fuel mileage thanks to its lightweight aluminum body and aerodynamic shape, the Prius trades ultimate fuel economy for increased utility. It holds five passengers and a good bit of cargo, meaning it functions as a useable family car.Toyota is keen on pointing out that Prius (on sale in Japan since 1997), and not Insight, was the first mass-produced gas/electric hybrid vehicle in the world. The company held off on introducing the model to U.S. customers until it could gauge consumer interest and boost power levels.An all-aluminum 1.5-liter gasoline engine makes 70 horsepower. Variable valve timing with intelligence (VVT-i) helps maximize engine efficiency while minimizing emissions, and power is put to the ground via a continuously variable transmission driving the front wheels. The electric drive motor is worth another 44 peak horsepower, bringing the maximum potential horsepower output to 114. The Prius operates on either electricity or gasoline alone, or a combination of both. Depending on speed and load, the ratio of power provided by each system is constantly adjusted by electronics to keep the vehicle in its most efficient operating mode. Even then, acceleration is slow; 0-to-60 mph takes 12.8 seconds. We're thinking Prius is for use primarily in the city and not for blitzkrieg runs to Vegas.Driven with care, Prius will achieve 52 mpg in the city and 45 on the highway while meeting squeaky-clean SULEV emissions standards, according to the EPA. With its 11.9-gallon gas tank, the car has a maximum city range of just over 600 miles.A single model is available, loaded with amenities like air conditioning; remote keyless entry; cassette stereo; power windows, locks and mirrors; height-adjustable front seats; and 14-inch alloy wheels. Gauges and controls are located in the center of the dashboard, including an LCD screen that can be used to monitor fuel mileage in real time. New options are available this year, including a GPS navigation system, cruise control, side airbags and daytime running lights.Thanks to a tall stance, seating is upright with plenty of head- and foot room. Toyota likes to refer to the Prius as a \"real car,\" implying that Honda's hybrid Insight is not a real car. If the definition of real is capacity for more than two people and 10 cubic feet of stuff, then they're not fibbing.Whatever the case may be, it is obvious that hybrids are meeting with acceptance in the court of public opinion. Like the Insight, the Prius offers a viable alternative to gasoline powerplants without the limitations posed by electric-only cars like the GM EV1. If your blood runs green and not red, drop by your local Toyota dealer for a test drive.",

The last assault Toyota made on a domestic market was in 1993, when the T100 pickup was introduced as an alternative to big trucks from Ford, GM and Dodge.  The 1994 Dodge Ram and the lack of a V8 in the Toyota conspired to keep sales to a minimum.  We think the company has learned something from its experience with the T100.For instance, the Avalon's V6 is a powerful motor, allowing the Avalon to keep up with GM front-drivers like the LeSabre and Bonneville in acceleration, and besting the V8-powered Crown Victoria in the race to 60 mph.  Handling is on par with the Bonneville SSE, and braking is outstanding.Inside, the Avalon is noticeably more narrow than the domestic competition, but six will fit in a pinch when equipped with the optional bench seat.  The rear seat is exceptionally comfortable, offering more leg and foot room than bigger sedans, with good support and a high seating position.Front seats are comfy as well, and face an ergonomically designed dashboard that places everything right where you expect to find it.  This car reeks of quality construction and materials inside and out.  The styling is generic, with oversize headlights and a narrow grille imparting an out-of-balance appearance to the front end.Overall, the Avalon impresses us as an excellent alternative to aging, and aesthetically impaired, offerings from GM and Ford.  Chrysler's LH-Series sedans are a better value, but the guaranteed quality of the Toyota is probably worth the extra couple grand.  One car you ought to look at before you buy the Avalon is the Chevy Impala SS.  It will make you feel like a kid again, and is far more stimulating to look at than this Toyota.",

Natural White, Imperial Jade Mica and Horizon Blue Metallic replace White, Copper Canyon Mica, Evergreen Pearl and Cool Steel Metallic as color options. Toyota's sixth-generation compact pickup debuted as a 1995.5 model with an actual model name: Tacoma. It's supposed to suggest the rugged outdoors, as well as strength and adventure. Any of three potent engines go under the hood. Toyota aimed for aggressive styling, inside and out, and Tacomas sport an excellent selection of interior fittings. Regular and extended cab bodies are available, with either two- or four-wheel drive.A freshening of the front end occurred on both the two- and four-wheel drive models during the last two model years. Swoopy fenders, a larger bumper, aero-style headlamps and a new grille set this truck apart from its forebears. Two-wheel drive Tacomas get a 2.4-liter four-cylinder base engine, rated at 142-horsepower. Tacoma 4x4s earn a 150-horspower, 2.7-liter four. Toyota claims that its four-cylinder engines are comparable to V6s from competitors. If those won't suffice, however, consider the V6 option: a DOHC, 24-valve unit that whips out 190 horses and 220 foot-pounds of torque. With V6 power, borrowed from the now defunct T100, this compact pickup can tow up to 5,000 pounds and soundly trounce most factory sport trucks in the stoplight dragrace.All Tacomas have front coil springs instead of the former torsion bars, but 4x4s feature longer suspension travel to improve ride/handling qualities. Manual-shift trucks feature reverse-gear synchronization to reduce gear noise when shifting into reverse. Four-wheel antilock braking is optional on all Tacomas, and all pickups contain dual airbags with a shut-off switch for the passenger's side. In top-of-the-line Limited pickups, a One-Touch Hi-Four switch is available for easy, pushbutton engagement of four-wheel drive.The PreRunner model is set to attract truck buyers who desire, but cannot afford, a 4WD truck, 4WD truck owners who don't use their 4WD as often as they expected, and 2WD truck buyers who take their vehicle off-road. Historically, a \"pre-runner\" is a truck that pre-runs an off-road race course. Toyota's new PreRunner has benefited from considerable suspension tuning and development work with Toyota Motorsports desert racing truck program to produce a 2WD vehicle with 4WD capabilities.Toyota hopes to attract buyers with the style and image of its Tacoma as well as a lower price tag. We like the Tacoma, but question the value it represents. Most of these Toyota trucks don't come cheap. Guess that's the price you pay for the peace of mind a Toyota provides.",

A capable compact pickup with a variety of body styles and a strong reputation for reliability. Value is in question, however, as a short standard equipment list makes it easy to spend a bundle on options. Tacoma. Toyota says the name is supposed to suggest the rugged outdoors, as well as strength and adventure, but a friend of ours once quipped, \"Obviously, nobody from Toyota has actually been to Tacoma.\"Making pickups for the U.S. market since 1964 (remember the Stout, anyone?), Toyota introduced its sixth-generation truck and the Tacoma nameplate in 1995. Designed and built in America, the Tacoma line has been well received. Since '95, Toyota has been steadily increasing the number of Tacoma variations. There are now 17 different versions, meaning the odds are good that you'll be able to find a truck to fit your needs.Toyota hopes to attract buyers with the handsome styling and rugged image of its Tacoma as well as its reputation for quality and reliability. We give the truck high marks, but often question the value it represents. Most of these Toyota trucks don't come cheap. Guess that's the price you pay for the peace of mind a Toyota provides. You'll find one of three engines underneath the hood of a Tacoma. Two-wheel-drive Tacomas get a 2.4-liter, four-cylinder base engine, rated at 142 horsepower and 160 pound-feet of torque. Tacoma 4WDs and 2WD PreRunners are upgraded with 2.7-liter four with 150 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Standard on Double Cab and optional on Xtracab models is a 3.4-liter V6 that whips out 190 horses and 220 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices include either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic. When it comes to towing power, four-cylinder models can handle up to 3,500 pounds, while the V6 is capable of handling up to 5,000 pounds. Antilock brakes with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution are standard on all Tacomas. Traction control is standard on V6 models (V6 PreRunners also have a limited-slip differential), and stability control is optional. In government crash testing, the 2004 Toyota Tacoma earned three stars (out of a possible five) for driver safety in frontal impacts and four stars for the passenger. In side-impact testing, it received three stars for front-occupant safety, with a high likelihood of pelvic injury. The IIHS gave the Tacoma an \"Acceptable\" rating for frontal offset crash testing. Driving the 2004 Toyota Tacoma is easy enough thanks to its compact dimensions. Both four-cylinder engines offer adequate acceleration, while the V6 has a broad power band and is well suited for towing and off-roading. Ride quality can suffer if the TRD off-road package is ordered, but the payoff in terms of enhanced off-road ability is well worth it. Handling is competent on pavement, and the brakes are strong. The Tacoma's interiors are industrial in design and look dated, but are constructed of high-quality materials. Switchgear is logically placed and easy to use. The seats are generally comfortable, but larger drivers might find them short on room. The 2004 Toyota Tacoma comes in three body styles: Regular Cab, Xtracab and Double Cab. Each is available with two-wheel or four-wheel drive. Toyota also offers Tacomas with a \"PreRunner\" designation. PreRunners are 2WD trucks that have the looks and heavy-duty suspension of 4WD models. The Double Cab is a compact crew cab that offers four full-size doors and a longer passenger compartment for people who want a pickup and an SUV but can't afford both. In order to keep overall length reasonable for on- and off-road maneuverability, the Double Cab's bed length is shortened to 61.5 inches. Toyota also offers a special 2WD S-Runner Xtracab sport truck equipped with the V6, a five-speed manual transmission and a sport-tuned suspension. Standard features are few and far between. On most Tacomas, items like air conditioning, cruise control, bucket seats and power windows and locks are all optional. Toyota does offer two optional packages -- SR5 and Limited -- that bundle the most desired features. A TRD off-road package is also available that includes an upgraded suspension, meaty 16-inch tires and a locking rear differential.",

Improvements have also been made by using sound-deadening material in the dash area, reducing engine noise in the passenger compartment. The mini-SUV market is booming.  Geo introduced a four-door Tracker this year, Suzuki spruced up the Sidekick with a more powerful engine and body cladding, and Kia dropped a bigger engine and an airbag into its Sportage.  Even the ancient Jeep Cherokee is selling like hotcakes, thanks to its powerful inline six-cylinder engine, low price, and rugged Jeep heritage.Toyota, who in the past half-decade has taken on the luxury sedan market with Lexus, the full-sized pickup market with the T100, and the traditional full-sized sedan market with the Avalon, now has its sights set on wealth-deprived twenty- and thirty-somethings who want an SUV but can't afford to fork out 25 to 30 grand for a 4Runner.  The RAV4 (Recreational Active Vehicle with 4WD) is a new mini-SUV designed to capitalize on the low end of this booming market.All RAV4s are powered by a 2.0-liter, 120-horsepower engine, hooked to either a five-speed or automatic transmission powering the front or all wheels.  The RAV4 is the first sport utility with front-wheel drive.  All-wheel drive models use powertrain components from the now-defunct Celica All-Trac.  Four-wheel anti-lock brakes are optional on all models.  Minimum ground clearance is 7.5-inches on the four-door model; two-door RAV4s get an additional .2 inches.  We haven't driven the RAV4, but gave it a close examination at the Arizona Auto Show.  The four-door is comfortable and typically Toyota in materials and design.  Very functional, little flair, and durable in feel and appearance.  The rear seat is a bit cramped for six-footers, but is comfortable enough for short trips.  Fortunately, the split folding rear seat reclines a bit to increase head room.  The cargo area of the four-door is larger than one would expect, offering more room behind the rear seat than a Chevrolet Caprice Classic.  Two-door models are fine for singles or couples without children.  The rear seat is tiny, and less than 10 cubic feet of cargo volume is available with the back seat up.On paper and in person, the RAV4 is a sensible vehicle with loads of personality.  Pricing, as with many Japan-built imports, is this sport ute's main problem.  A 4WD four-door with automatic, ABS, alloy wheels, air conditioning, cruise, cassette and a tilt wheel is gonna run you $21,750.  Add power locks, windows, and mirrors and the price escalates to $22,700.  In contrast, a Kia Sportage EX runs less than $20,000 similarly equipped.  Loaded Trackers and Sidekicks are also less expensive.  Still, the Toyota is bigger inside, cuter outside, and comes standard with Toyota's reputation for quality.  For many buyers, this will be enough to close the sale.  However, we think the Jeep Cherokee is a better value than any of the mini-SUV's on the market, including the RAV4.",

A new luxury package for the XL includes power leather-trimmed seats, 15-inch alloy wheels, remote keyless entry and a JBL audio system. There's also a Sport Luxury package that adds 16-inch alloy wheels and a rear spoiler in addition to the items in the luxury package. A comfortable, though pasteurized, full-size sedan. It would seem buyers of full-size sedans generally aren't interested in character. Most big four-doors are dull pieces of machinery to look at and a snooze to drive. The beauty in such a vehicle lies in what it can do for the customer in terms of providing space for people and things without compromising the ride or occupant comfort. It should look upscale, but not gaudy, providing just enough glitz and luxury to let others know you have achieved a degree of success in life. Finally, such a vehicle must also be reliable and able to handle years of daily-driver tasks without so much as a whimper. Since its introduction in 1995, the Toyota Avalon has fit this description: bland as egg whites, but solid, roomy and dependable. There are two models from which to choose: XL and XLS. The main difference between the two is the level of standard equipment, with XLS representing the more luxurious version with JBL audio, programmable HomeLink remote system, remote keyless entry and aluminum wheels.Either can be ordered with front bucket or bench seats trimmed in available leather upholstery. Other options include a premium audio system with a six-disc in-dash CD changer, memory seating positions for front passengers, a sunroof and a 115-volt A/C outlet capable of powering small electronic devices.For its own power, the Avalon relies on a three-liter V6 engine. Equipped with variable valve timing, this V6 offers good fuel economy and power. It produces 210 horsepower and 220 pound-feet of torque, which is transmitted to the front wheels through a four-speed automatic.These horses are more than enough for city driving and highway passing, and owners can expect 0-to-60 acceleration times to take about 8 seconds. Once moving, the Avalon's light steering and soft suspension make for comfortable long-distance cruising.Toyota's full-size car is also great for transporting people and luggage. Road and wind noise is minimal thanks to thick side glass and substantial sound-deadening materials. While billed as a six-passenger car with the front bench, the middle front occupant doesn't have much legroom. We recommend getting an Avalon with the comfortable and supportive bucket seats unless there is genuine need for six-passenger seating. The trunk holds 15.9 cubic feet of cargo, and there is a locking pass-through door behind the rear seat. This pass-through allows room for longer items such as skis.Another one of Avalon's strengths lies in safety. The car has earned a crash-test rating of \"Good\" from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and better-than-average scores from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Toyota's Vehicle Skid Control, or VSC, can be added to the Avalon XLS. This system includes traction and stability control systems that can reduce the chance of hazardous skids and slides. The Avalon also features a brake-assist system that detects emergency braking and applies supplemental pressure to reduce stopping distances.With the Avalon, Toyota meets and exceeds the full-size sedan-buyer's expectations. Sure, the price is higher than offerings from Detroit like the Buick LeSabre and Mercury Grand Marquis. But unflappable quality doesn't come cheap. Want a Lexus but need six-passenger capacity or huge amounts of rear legroom? The Avalon is your car.",

Track width has been increased, too, for a more stable ride.  Rack-and-pinion steering replaces the old recirculating-ball layout, for better feel and response.  Manual-shift trucks feature reverse-gear synchronization, to reduce gear noise when shifting into reverse.  Four-wheel antilock braking is an option, but all pickups contain an airbag for the driver.  In top-of-the-line SR5 Xtracab pickups, a One-Touch Hi-4 switch is available for easy, pushbutton engagement of four-wheel-drive.  By redesigning and lowering the floor by 1.6 inches, Toyota makes 4x4s easier to enter.Tacomas are produced at the NUMMI joint-venture facility in Fremont, California, having been designed in that state.  Options include cruise control, air conditioning, a sliding rear window, tilt steering wheel, and moonroof.  We like the Tacoma, but question the value it represents.  These new Toyota trucks don't come cheap.  Guess that's the price you pay for the peace of mind a Toyota provides.",

All 4Runners have power door locks this year, as well as a prewired trailer hitch harness, a modified grille design and freshened taillights. New wheels for Limited and Sport debut, and a new premium 3-in-1 audio system with a CD changer is available. Revised sun visors with extensions and a HomeLink programmable transmitter come standard on Limited and can be ordered on SR5. Limited also gets a new color of wood trim, and standard front seat heaters. There's bad news for hard-core off-roaders -- the optional differential lock has been discontinued with the demise of the manual transmission. Three new colors replace two old ones on the color chart. A likeable SUV that reminds you, for better or for worse, of its truck-based origins. In the six years since the current 4Runner debuted, the segment of the marketplace in which it competes has exploded in popularity and become littered with fine sport-utes. Yet, Toyota's rugged entry continues to represent an excellent choice, despite its age and distinctly truck-like underpinnings.That's right. If you're looking for a tall car, the 4Runner is likely to disappoint with its stiff ride and general lack of road feel. But if it's a roomy vehicle made for serious off-road work, combined with creature comforts and a solid reputation for reliability, that you're after, then you've come to the right place.For 2001, Toyota has overhauled the 4Runner lineup, limiting selection to two trim levels and a single power plant. Choose from standard SR5 or luxurious Limited outfittings in either two- or four-wheel drive. A 3.4-liter, dual overhead-cam V6, attached to a four-speed automatic transmission, makes 183 tortured horsepower at 4,800 rpm, and peak torque doesn't arrive until you've revved into the middle part of the band. It's adequate, but you'll likely find yourself wishing for more go-power. The manual five-speed transmission and the differential locks that could be added to models with row-'em-yourself gears are gone for 2001.Toyota has added some impressive technology as standard equipment for 2001. Vehicle Skid Control (VSC), traction control and ABS enhanced with electronic brake force distribution and brake assist comes on every new 4Runner. VSC is a stability control system that helps keep the 4Runner under control when a lateral skid is detected. Brake assist can apply maximum braking power under emergency situations quicker than the driver can.Inside, passengers, once they manage to clamber aboard, are greeted by a chunky, purposeful dash that wasn't so much styled as it was pieced together. No matter, it works from an ergonomic standpoint. Seating is comfortable and supportive front and rear, with backseat riders benefiting from plenty of legroom. Cloth upholstery in the SR5 Sport is abrasive, but the Limited has far more pleasing leather hides covering the seats. Limited models have a standard new sun visor design with extensions and a HomeLink transmitter, a setup that is optional on SR5 models.Cargo capacity measures 44.6 cubic feet with the rear seat in use, and 79.8 cubic feet with it folded. Able to tow 5,000 pounds when properly equipped, the 4Runner excels off-road, with as much as 11 inches of ground clearance when the optional P265/70R16 tires are selected. A slick, powered rear window in the hatch, combined with the large, optional sunroof and lowered side glass, results in an open, airy vehicle - much like a convertible, but not.Add the available Sports Package to the SR5, and you'll get a fender-blistered, hood-scooped, monochromatic exterior treatment on the outside with larger brakes, bigger alloy wheels and a performance-oriented rear differential underneath. Limited is loaded with chrome accents, fake wood, heated seats and two-tone paint to set it apart as the more refined choice.4Runner is nevertheless a truck for people who like trucks. Stout and sturdy, rugged inside and out, and boasting excellent crash-test scores from both government and industry entities, this SUV, like most other Toyotas, can take whatever you throw at it.",

    "full_description": "The Sequoia is virtually unchanged for 2002. SR5 models have two additional stand-alone options this year: keyless remote and front foglamps. A thoroughly capable full-size SUV that beats Ford and General Motors at their own game. Toyota is going after a sizable chunk of the full-size SUV market with its 2002 Sequoia. Introduced just last year, it slots between the 4Runner and Land Cruiser in price but not size.Larger than a Tahoe or Yukon and about the same size as an Expedition, the Sequoia's length, width, height, wheelbase and interior space all measure greater than the Chevrolet and GMC, while third-seat room and cargo space is on par with all three competing models. The Sequoia only offers eight-passenger capacity, compared to a maximum of nine occupants in the Tahoe, Yukon and Expedition. Built on the same platform as the Tundra truck, the Sequoia incorporates a few key modifications to help it deliver a more docile ride. Structurally identical to the Toyota Tundra pickup from the front doors forward, the Sequoia gets additional frame reinforcement and a sophisticated five-link coil spring rear suspension for improved ride quality and control. Despite its imposing size, the big brute feels surprisingly agile around town, with an easy-to-drive character more akin to a Camry than a full-size sport-ute. The Sequoia is powered by a smooth and silent 4.7-liter V8 making 240 horsepower and 315 pound-feet of torque using regular unleaded fuel. It's also the first Toyota truck to be certified as a ULEV (ultra-low-emission vehicle). Two- or four-wheel-drive models are available. The Sequoia's maximum towing capacity tops out at 6,500 pounds (6,200 on four-wheel-drive models), a respectable, though significantly less stout, figure than its heavier-duty competition.Safety features are plentiful. All Sequoias come with a traction control system and Vehicle Skid Control (VSC), Toyota's stability control system that helps to maintain the vehicle's cornering stability in situations where the truck is about to lose traction and skid sideways. Other hardware includes antilock brakes with Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD), dual front airbags and three-point seatbelts for all seating positions (the front belts have force limiters and pre-tensioners, while all positions except the driver's are ALR/ELR, allowing for easier installation of child seats). Side airbags along with head-protection side curtain airbags are optional.Two trim levels are available: SR5 and loaded-up Limited. The latter buys you standard gear like leather seating, power retractable exterior mirrors, dual air conditioning, seat heaters, ten-speaker JBL sound system and aluminum wheels. Limited also includes third-row seating, privacy glass, a roof rack and a tow hitch. Both models offer outstanding comfort for both front and rear passengers.The Sequoia is built alongside the Tundra pickup truck near Terre Haute, Ind. A loaded-up Sequoia certainly isn't cheap, but compare similarly equipped Expeditions and Tahoe/Yukons, and you'll find that the Sequoia prices out almost identical to its domestic competition. If you want one, consider this: Toyota expects to build only 60,000 Sequoias annually. We predict a serious shortfall, resulting in demand that far outstrips supply. You should probably start discussing your order with your Toyota dealer, like, yesterday.",

The TRD Off-Road package is now available on Access Cabs with a V8 engine, while models equipped with a V6 receive an upgraded alternator. A note-pad holder is now optional on SR5 and Limited, while Base regular cab trucks lose their standard cassette player. Two new colors are available, filling three slots left vacant by old colors that have been discontinued. The 2001 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup suited more for the general consumer than for commercial use. As the maker of America's best-selling sedan, it must have been frustrating for Toyota to learn that trucks are now outselling cars in this country, especially since the closest thing to a full-size pickup truck previously offered by Toyota was the poorly received T100. But the company learns from its mistakes, and went to work building a proper workhorse for American consumers.With last year's introduction of the Tundra, Toyota has finally crafted a full-fledged, maximum-sized pickup, capable of running with the big dogs on several fronts. Topping its pedigree is an available 4.7-liter, I-Force V8 engine lifted directly from the Land Cruiser/LX 470 sport utility twins. This smooth-revving and ultra-refined power plant makes 245 horsepower and 315 foot-pounds of torque and is available only with a four-speed automatic transmission. Payload capacity is 2,000 pounds and towing capacities for the V8 start at 5,000 pounds (it goes up to 7,000 pounds with an optional tow package). A 3.4-liter, dual overhead-cam V6, making 190 horsepower and 220 foot-pounds of torque, is standard on regular-cab Tundras, and may be mated to either a four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual transmission. Toyota has failed, in some regards, to meet the demands of current truck buyers when it comes to configuration. The Tundra is available in regular and extended-cab versions. Unfortunately, regular-cab versions come only in longbed form, while extended-cab models come only as shortbeds. The latter does include two \"suicide\" doors for easier rear-seat access (which, by the way, is what Toyota calls its four-door Tundra layout: Access Cab), but the space back there is tiny in comparison to trucks from Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge and GMC. Those domestic truck-makers also let the buyer build a pickup to meet specific style and creature comfort needs, ranging from bare-bones work trucks to luxury-lined haulers. Toyota gives you three trim levels and a comparatively sparse option list, though dealers will likely be happy to load you up with running boards and gold packages if given the chance.Inside, the Tundra feels a bit more compact than its American counterparts, lacking adequate seat-track travel and a seat height adjuster (in the volume-leading SR5 Access Cab) for optimal comfort when taller drivers are behind the wheel. Rear seat room is also tight, with legroom at a premium for anyone of average height. Tundra's cabin does offer a quiet ride that surpasses competing trucks, as well as many cars, and options like leather seating and a CD changer further contribute to the Tundra's relaxing internal environment for shorter folks. But interior plastics come straight from the Corolla parts bin, and many have a cheap feel and luster that no amount of cowhide can mask. We wish Toyota offered more variety in areas like configuration and option packages, and an increase in cab space would help the Tundra better compete with the extended cab models from GM, Ford and Dodge. Still, the fact that a V8-powered pickup can now be had with a Toyota nameplate on it means that there's a new sub-set of rules for America's truck buyer.",

In 1996, Toyota separated this high-volume SUV from its pickup truck roots.  Thus, the current 4Runner shares little with the Tacoma pickup.  As a result, engineers have created a refined vehicle without sacrificing tough off-road ability.  Generous suspension travel and tread width provide capable off-road ability, ride and handling.  The interior is quite roomy, thanks to a wheelbase that is two inches longer than the previous version.  A low floor and wide doors make getting into and out of the 4Runner less of an exercise in contortionism than those riding in Jeep Cherokees or Nissan Pathfinders are likely to experience.Two engines are available on the 4Runner: a 2.7-liter inline four cylinder that makes 150 horsepower at 4800 rpm and 177 foot-pounds of torque at 4000 rpm, and a 3.4-liter V6 producing 183 horsepower at 4800 rpm and 217 foot-pounds of torque at 3600 rpm.  These figures represent a substantial improvement over the previous anemic four cylinder and wheezy V6.  In fact, the 2.7-liter four is more powerful than the 1995 model's 3.0-liter six, and is nearly as powerful as the base engine found in the Ford Explorer XL.Needless to say, all of this adds up to a very competitive sport-ute.  Safety isn't ignored in the 4Runner, either, which sports dual airbags and standard antilock brakes on V6 models.  (Antilock brakes are optional on four-cylinder models.)Overall, the 4Runner is a very nice truck which provides the sophistication that we have come to expect from Toyota products with the overall ruggedness more often associated with Jeeps.  Prices are high,  however, running from $21,000 for a 2WD four-cylinder Base model to over $36,000 for a fully loaded Limited.  This lands the 4Runner right smack dab in the Mercedes-Benz ML320, Nissan Pathfinder LE and Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited territory.  The competition in this segment is getting fierce and there are plenty of good  choices for your money, definitely something worth considering when shelling out such a large chunk of change.",

A late-year introduction of the new RAV4 convertible makes this sport-ute more appealing for those who live in the sunbelt. The mini-SUV business is booming.  Introductions of fresh models by Honda, Kia and Subaru indicate that there continues to be a large market for those who want the security of an AWD truck without the punishing ride and gas mileage that goes with it.  Largely comprised of car-based AWD vehicles, this new market will gain even more entrants over the next few years as Land Rover, BMW and Mercedes introduce small trucklets to the US.  One of the early players in the game was Toyota, which recognized this potential boom early on and jumped into the fray with the RAV4 in 1996.A 2.0-liter, 120-horsepower engine hooked to either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission powers the front or all wheels of the different RAV4 models.  This makes the RAV4 the first sport utility available with front-wheel drive.  All-wheel drive models use powertrain components from the now-defunct Celica All-Trac.  Four-wheel antilock brakes are optional on all RAV4s.  Minimum ground clearance is 7.5 inches on the four-door model; two-door RAV4s get .2 additional inches of clearance.The RAV4 is a pretty decent around town driver, handling more like the car from which its platform is derived than a traditional SUV.  Power is on the low side, however; the 120-horsepower engine works hard to drag this mini-ute up even small hills.  The interior is not a bad place to spend time, offering fairly comfortable seating for four adults in the four-door models.  The cargo area of the four-door is larger than one would expect, too, offering more room behind the rear seat than a Ford Crown Victoria.  Two-door models are fine for singles or couples without children.  The rear seat is tiny, and less than 10 cubic feet of cargo volume is available with the back seat up.The Toyota RAV4 is a convincing package.  Its eye-grabbing looks appeal to those who are young or just  young at heart.  Around college campuses the RAV4 litters the streets in front of Greek Row more than smashed bottles of Boone's Farm.  Surprisingly, however, we have also seen the RAV4 towed behind a large number of motor homes that swoop into Arizona, Texas, and California every winter, leading us to believe that they are a hit with the more mature crowd, too.  We are fond of the RAV4, but there are a number of choices in this growing segment and we can't help but think that the more refined and powerful Honda CR-V might offer shoppers more of what they are looking for in a small truck: power, utility and value.",

Resting under the hood is a powerful, 3.0-liter V6 engine that was stolen from the Camry parts bin. The engine isn't the only piece of equipment pilfered from the Camry; the Sienna rides on a stretched and modified Camry platform and uses much of the Camry's interior switchgear. Appropriately referred to internally at Toyota as \"The Camry of minivans,\" we can only assume that the company expects this creation to be as popular as their hot-selling sedan.In order to harness the 194 horses at work under the hood, engineers put antilock brakes at all four wheels of every Sienna. Other safety equipment includes dual airbags, side-impact protection that meets future federal standards and seatbelt pretensioners for both front seats. Last year the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety conducted an offset crash test of the Sienna and called it \"the best performing vehicle in the history of the test.\"Interestingly, Toyota was able to talk rivals General Motors and Chrysler into lending a hand on the Sienna's manufacturing process. Not used to making such a large vehicle, Toyota had questions about how to deal with the interior assembly of this van which has well over 130 cubic feet of cargo space.In the end, General Motors and Chrysler may be sorry that they offered to help Toyota figure out some of its manufacturing logistics.

    "full_description": "One of America's favorite cars is all new this year. Design goals for the 2002 Toyota Camry included larger interior packaging, reduced noise, more advanced safety features, better driving dynamics and, of course, a new standard of value. Toyota has succeeded in building a better mousetrap -- it's got more interior space, a more powerful base engine and a bevy of premium features for buyers willing to pay extra. If you ever need confirmation that Americans are completely different from Europeans (besides German tourists' propensity for wearing black socks and shorts), look no further than the Toyota Camry. Here is a car that, for the past four years, has been the best-selling car in America and a near definition of the American passenger car. In Europe, Camry sales barely register.The Camry's success in the U.S. lies in its ability to sensibly fulfill the needs of consumers seeking a roomy vehicle that sets a benchmark in quality, reliability and value. For 2002, the Camry enters its fifth generation with an all-new design, and Toyota has done everything within its power to make sure the Camry continues its success.One question remains: How do you improve on a bestseller? Simple -- give Americans more of what they like. And the engineers at Toyota have done just that, simultaneously retaining all the things that make a Camry great while imbuing it with a new feel.We Americans like a lot of room for our families and gear. Therefore, the Camry's wheelbase has been lengthened by 2 inches, resulting in a more spacious interior and 1.5 more inches of legroom for rear seaters. The trunk is bigger, too, expanding to hold a maximum of 16.7 cubic feet of cargo.Outside, the previous Camry's clean and inoffensive (many people would add \"bland\") styling has been updated with an aggressive grille and sharp-cut headlamps. The cabin and doors feature sleek character lines, connected to a rear integrated bumper that is complemented with new jewel-like tail lamps. Aerodynamic drag is reduced, and sound deadening has been improved for reduced interior noise.Few Americans would say that their cars have too much horsepower. So for 2002, Toyota has updated the popular 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine to produce 157 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, besting the previous engine's numbers by 24 and 14, respectively.Remaining virtually the same is the optional 192-horsepower 3.0-liter V6. It now achieves ULEV certification, as does the 2.4-liter. Transferring power to the front wheels for both engines is a smoother shifting electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual (four-cylinder only).Each engine is available with the three different trim levels this year: LE, SE and XLE. Last year's entry-level CE is replaced by the LE, which remains the core volume model but with a higher level of standard equipment, including power windows, mirrors and locks; air conditioning with particulate filtration; cruise control; and an ambient temperature gauge.The XLE gets power driver and passenger seats, heated outside mirrors, a premium JBL audio system, climate control with rear-seat vents, steering wheel-mounted controls, a compass in the electrochromic mirror, a rear sunshade and 16-inch wheels. The new SE grade combines distinctive and sportier styling elements with chassis tuning that delivers a firmer ride, enhanced steering and nimble handling.Optional for all V6 models is a Vehicle Skid Control (VSC) that corrects understeer and oversteer deviancy. Side and, for the first time, side curtain airbags for front and rear passengers are also available. Other add-ons to keep the Camry up-to-date include Toyota's excellent navigation system and an in-dash six-disc CD changer. Fully loaded, a top-of-the-line Camry XLE is a few hundred dollars more than a stripped-down Lexus ES 300. Unless your day depends on being the owner of a luxury marque car with real wood trim, we can't imagine that anyone would forego the Camry.The all-new Camry is an enticing pick for 2002. It remains loyal to its original mission while still offering more features and better driving enjoyment. Unless Americans start wearing black socks with shorts, the Camry should retain its title as the best-selling car for another year.",

To get remote keyless entry or a power driver seat on the LE, you must buy a Value Package. A power moonroof and an in-dash six-disc CD changer require the Leather Value Package on XLE models. LE V6 models get daytime running lights standard, while JBL audio is optional on all LEs. The anti-theft system with engine immobilizer is restricted to XLE V6 models. Comfort and a reputation for reliability make the 2001 Toyota Camry an American favorite. A home appliance on wheels. The Toyota Camry is one of America's most-favored mid-size sedans. The reasons are simple. It boasts room for five adults, can be ordered with a powerful and smooth-revving V6, and comes with the reputation of solid Toyota reliability. But can you believe the recent \"I'm Too Sexy\" advertising campaign?  Featuring the lead singer from one-hit-wonder band Right Said Fred, the TV ads proclaim that the Camry is too sexy for a number of things, including drive-thrus, car washes and dry cleaning pick-up runs.  So, uh, what are you supposed to use the innocuously styled sedan for?  Picking up hot dates?  Running Laguna Seca?  Impressing the Joneses?Camry can be equipped for everything from rugged family life or plush luxury touring, but nothing particularly sexy.  Club hopping and canyon carving are not on the menu, though Toyota Racing Development (TRD - how sexy is that acronym?  Further evidence supporting our case for truthfulness in advertising.) will sell you a kit that turns this grocery-getter into a competent handler.  There are three different trims: base-level CE, mid-level LE, and the top-level XLE.  LE and XLE can be equipped with a delicious 3.0-liter V6 engine, which produces 200 horsepower and 214 foot-pounds of torque.  Acceleration is impressive, and unlike six-pot Honda Accords and Mitsubishi Galants, the Camry LE V6 can be ordered with a manual transmission.  Pop the TuRD components on, and you've got a hell of a sleeper.  Braking is swift and sure with the antilock system, and Camry hangs on well in corners despite rather meek all-season radials and substantial body roll.  This car is tuned for a soft, quiet ride out of the factory. Inside, controls and gauges are laid-out nicely in a dated but ergonomically correct dashboard.  The switches and stalks all exhibit a solid heft, imparting a sense of quality.  Abundant storage areas include a deep center console, door bins, and dashboard bins.  Front cupholders accommodate 20-ounce bottles of your favorite beverage.  The only downside to this cabin is that you might find the seats uncomfortable. Notable options include side airbags, traction control, a JBL sound system, leather interior trim, and a power moonroof.  ABS is standard on LE and XLE models equipped with a V6 engine.For 2001, Toyota has juggled value package content and stand-alone option availability.  Want air conditioning and power windows/locks/mirrors on the CE?  How about remote keyless entry or a power driver's seat on the LE?  Don't forget a power moonroof and six-disc in-dash CD changer on an XLE.  All require the purchase of a Value Package.  A JBL audio system is newly optional on all LEs, this year, and an anti-theft system with engine immobilizer is restricted to XLE V6 models.  Overall, Camry works well as a family sedan.  Fully optioned, it's considerably more expensive than domestic competitors, but given the Camry's best-seller status, it seems most Americans consider this Toyota to be a worthwhile expenditure.",

    "full_description": "Toyota's Corolla is all-new for 2003. Far removed from the original Corolla, this one is the biggest yet. It's also more luxurious. The return is more interior room, a more substantial feel and changes aimed at fixing the previous model's shortcomings. Though pricing has increased, Toyota has made more equipment standard in the hopes of keeping the Corolla's reputation for value intact. With sportier styling, a larger interior, an improved drivetrain and added standard equipment, the 2003 Corolla will find success. Toyota's venerable Corolla has gone through many changes since it was first introduced in 1968. Over the course of its long life, the Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan. The world has seen enough people fall in love with this car to make it the best-selling nameplate in the history of automobiles.Recent competition, however, has outclassed the Corolla. So for 2003, Toyota's baked up an all-new model to serve the buying public better. The new Corolla is bigger, more powerful and more luxurious than the model it replaces.More power comes in the form of a 130-hp 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. Thanks to a variable valve timing system (Toyota's VVT-i), this engine provides good acceleration anywhere in the rev range. It's also clean enough to allow the car to earn ULEV emissions status. Transmission choices are either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic. Last year's doggy three-speed automatic has been mercifully removed from the lineup.Trim levels continue to be the base CE, the better-equipped LE and the sporty S. More features are standard this year, and even the lowly CE comes with air conditioning with micron filtration, a CD player, power steering, power mirrors, an outside temperature gauge, 60/40 split-folding rear seats and 15-inch wheels.The S model includes \"sporty\" trim such as body-color rocker panels and door handles, smoked headlights, foglights, special gauges and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Go with the LE to gain fake-wood trim, a vertical seat height adjuster (also on the S) and remote keyless entry. Options include upgraded audio systems, ABS, side airbags, cruise control, leather seating and a sunroof.Inside the cabin, Toyota has made a number of changes to improve comfort. Interior volume is up, and so is roominess. The controls are easier to reach and have a higher-quality feel to them. Though some legroom has been sacrificed in the translation to higher seating positions within the Corolla, other key passenger measurements have all been increased. Even trunk space is up to 13.6 cubic feet.Much of this newfound room is due to the car's larger size. Curb weight has increased, but it's only about 50 pounds more. Toyota says the Corolla has a more substantial feel, and ride quality is said to be both firmer and more comfortable. The front suspension is MacPherson struts as before, while the rear changes to torsion beam.All of these updates should only add to what are already Corolla's strengths: a reputation for reliability and a strong resale value. This new 2003 version, with sportier styling, a larger interior, an improved drivetrain and added standard equipment, can only ensure the model's continued success.",

The Corolla also achieves low emission vehicle status this year. Reliable but bland, the 2000 Toyota Corolla is a conservative pick in the economy sedan class. The Toyota Corolla has gone through many changes since it was first introduced in 1968. Over the course of its long life, the Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan. The world has seen enough people fall in love with this car to make it one of the best-selling vehicles in the history of automobiles.Now while that's neat and all, we're sure that what's really important to you and your wallet is whether the modern Corolla still has what it takes to stomp out its competitors. The current Corolla platform was introduced in 1998. In those two short years, the Dodge Neon, Ford Focus, Mazda Protege, and Volkswagen Golf have all been substantially redesigned or newly introduced.To fend them off, the Corolla comes equipped with a 1.8-liter, all-aluminum, DOHC four-cylinder engine that cranks out 125 horsepower. This is five more than last year, thanks to a variable valve timing and lift system that Toyota calls VVT-i. VVT-i employs continuously variable intake valve timing to provide greater engine performance, better fuel economy and reduced pollution over a wide range of rpm.With the exception of minimal legroom for both the driver and passengers, the Corolla's interior ergonomics are flawless. Toyota also managed to pack a multitude of interior storage compartments into the Corolla, including a small pullout drawer in the dash and a large bin under the HVAC controls. There is very little road noise and the Corolla handles quite well for a compact sedan.The Corolla is one of the best compact sedans on the market. Few competitors (with the exception of Honda) can match Toyota's run-forever reputation and high levels of build quality. But the Corolla will certainly have its work cut out for it in 2000. Equipped with options most customers are expecting these days (such as ABS, CD player, and cruise control), the price of a Corolla can quickly jump to more than $18,000. ",

    "full_description": "Nothing major is in store for Toyota's minivan this year. The most significant change is the availability of a new \"Symphony\" special edition for LE models. This special edition includes items like keyless entry, a roof rack, captain's chairs for the first two rows (six-way power driver seat), a premium JBL audio system, power swing privacy glass, color-keyed heated power side mirrors, an overhead console with HomeLink and painted bumpers and cladding. There's also a new color this year exclusive to the Symphony: Lunar Mist Metallic. The base CE model's Extra Value package now includes a roof rack and keyless entry for no extra cost. No more exciting than a toaster, but comes close to being the perfect minivan appliance. Despite the fact that it's five model years old and doesn't offer as much utility and functionality as newer competitors, the Toyota Sienna is one of the top choices in the minivan class. With the Sienna, Toyota has placed an emphasis on safety, quality and performance.There are three models: the base CE, the mid-level LE and the top-level XLE. All come standard with five doors. Under the hood is a smooth, powerful and refined 3.0-liter V6 mated to a four-speed automatic transmission that drives the front wheels. This powertrain setup can also be found in the Toyota Camry, fitting since the Sienna is built on a stretched and modified Camry platform. In the Sienna, the engine produces 210 horsepower and 220 pound-feet of torque.The Sienna's rigid and lightweight unitized body performed exceptionally well in government crash tests. Standard safety features include ABS, front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters, front height-adjustable seatbelt anchors, a low tire-pressure warning system and daytime running lights. Every Sienna can also be ordered with optional side airbags and a stability control system that helps prevent dangerous skids and spins.The Sienna driving experience is similar to the Camry in that it's pleasantly non-confrontational. Steering is sure, if not quite nimble. The suspension does a good job of soaking up road imperfections, and wind noise is kept to a minimum. Braking is exceptionally competent. Acceleration from the V6 is acceptable for almost all situations, and the cabin is quiet at highway speeds.The Sienna was designed to offer optimum interior roominess in a compact, easy-to-maneuver package. The interior has a definite Camry feel to it, constructed and trimmed in high-quality materials. Dual power doors are optional, and removable modular seating allows for custom configurations to accommodate a variety of cargo requirements. A second-row bench seat or captain's chairs and third-row seats can be folded or removed to accommodate bulkier cargo. Third-row seats also add a 50/50 split-folding and tumble feature for additional cargo space, but can't match many competitors for overall user-friendliness. What the Sienna needs to remain competitive in the class is a third-row seat that folds flat into the floor like newer models from Honda and Mazda. More comfortable front seats would help, too, as the current chairs are firm yet unsupportive and don't offer a wide enough range of adjustment.Overall, Toyota does not make the biggest or most useful minivan, but it does make a reliable, safe, well-performing and refined alternative to a number of family haulers on the market.",

The Kentucky-built Avalon features new styling inside and out, enhanced safety features, increased engine performance, and more comfort and convenience than its predecessor. A comfortable, though pasteurized, full-size sedan. It would seem buyers of full-sized sedans generally aren't too interested in character. Most full-size sedans are dull pieces of machinery to look at and a snooze to drive. The beauty in such a vehicle lies in what it can do for the customer in terms of providing space for people and things without compromising the ride or occupant comfort. It should look upscale, but not gaudy, providing just enough glitz and luxury to let others know you have achieved a degree of success in life. Finally, such a vehicle must also be reliable and able to handle years of daily-driver tasks without so much as a whimper.Since its introduction in 1995, the Toyota Avalon has fit this description. A little bland, perhaps, but solid, roomy, and dependable. For 2000, the Avalon enters its second generation. Substantial changes have been made to improve its already good traits, as well as add a bit of excitement. There are two models: XL and XLS. The main difference between the two is the level of standard equipment. Both can be ordered with front bucket or bench seats.Avalon's 3.0-liter V6 engine now features a variable valve timing system (Toyota calls its system VVT-i). The system provides additional horsepower, improved fuel economy and torque, lower emissions and smoother shifting. The previous Avalon was no slouch, so the engine improvements are just icing on the cake.Toyota has also updated the styling. A side benefit of this is a reduction in noise, vibration and harshness (NVH).  Comfort amenities include a new dual-control air conditioner, an optional JBL premium grade audio (standard on the XLS), and an improved multi-information display. There's also increased trunk volume, grocery bag hooks, and a larger storage tray and cargo net.  A universal remote system that can be programmed to open garage doors, gates and turn on house lights is standard on XLS models.Safety is enhanced with an optional package on XLS models that includes Vehicle Skid Control (VSC) and traction control. VSC utilizes the braking system to correct understeer or oversteer conditions in a turn.  Traction control reduces tire slippage during acceleration.  Toyota also added a brake-assist feature that detects emergency braking and applies supplemental line pressure to reduce stopping distance.Additional new safety features include a stronger body structure that effectively absorbs and diffuses energy along predictable paths, added energy absorbing material to the roof rails, front pillar and center pillar to help reduce potential head injury, and enlarged rearview mirrors.  The front seats have been strengthened and a rear center adjustable headrest has been added.We recommend that potential buyers of a new full-sized sedan take a look at the 2000 Avalon. As before, its price is more than the offerings from Detroit like the Buick LeSabre, Dodge Intrepid and Ford Crown Victoria. But unflappable quality has a price. Want a Lexus but need six-passenger capacity or huge amounts of rear legroom? The Avalon is your car.",

It features an optional V8 engine and can be ordered in a two- or four-door, regular- or extended-cab configuration. The 2000 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup suited more for the general consumer than commercial use. As the maker of America's best-selling automobile (the Camry), it must have been frustrating for Toyota to learn that trucks are now outselling cars in this country. Especially since the closest thing to a full-size pickup truck previously offered by Toyota was the anemic and poorly received T100. With the introduction of the Tundra in spring of 1999, as a 2000 model, Toyota has finally crafted a full-fledged, maximum-sized pickup, capable of running with the big dogs. Topping its pedigree is an optional 4.7-liter, I-Force V8 engine lifted directly from the Land Cruiser/LX 470 sport utility twins. This powerplant makes 245 horsepower and 315 foot-pounds of torque and is available only with a four-speed automatic transmission. Payload capacity is 2,000 pounds and towing capacities for the V8 start at 5,000 pounds (it goes up to 7,000 pounds with an optional tow package). A 3.4-liter V6, making 190 horsepower and 220 foot-pounds of torque is standard on base model Tundras, which may be mated to either a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission.Toyota has also met the demand of current truck buyers when it comes to configuration. The Tundra is available in regular and extended-cab versions, the latter with two rear-facing doors for easier rear-seat access (which, by the way, is what Toyota calls its four-door Tundra layout: Access Cab). Unfortunately, regular-cab versions come in longbed form only while Access Cab models come only as shortbeds.Inside, the Tundra feels a bit more compact than its American counterparts, but not uncomfortably so for front-seat passengers. Rear seating is another matter, with legroom at a premium for anyone of average height. With the exception of rear seating, the Tundra cabin is an excellent place to spend the day. It offers a quiet ride that surpasses competing trucks, as well as many cars. Options like leather seating and a 10-disc CD changer further contribute to the Tundra's relaxing internal environment.We wish Toyota offered more variety in areas like configuration and option packages, and an increase in rear-seat legroom would help the Tundra better compete with the extended cab models from GM, Ford and Dodge. Still, the very fact that a V8-powered, full-size pickup can now be had with a Toyota nameplate on it means that there's a whole new set of rules for America's truck buyer.",

Minor engine adjustments mean that the four-cylinder is fully compliant with all on-board diagnostic standards, and is now certified as a transitional low emission vehicle power plant.  Additionally, the interior of the DX line gets a new seat fabric, the LE Sedan is available with a leather package, and the Wagon can now be ordered with a power-operated driver seat. The 1996 Toyota Camry makes a lot of promises and delivers on most of them.  Reliability and ergonomics remain the cornerstone of Toyota's commitment to the U.S. market and the Camry exemplifies both of  these.The Camry is designed to fill the needs of the family; it does so in a way that doesn't leave consumers wanting.  Interior space is adequate, and allows comfortable seating for five; backseat passengers will appreciate the scalloped front seats which creates more knee room.  Trunk space is generous and the liftover height is not too imposing.  Since this is a Toyota, gauges are laid out in a logical manner and all of the controls are within easy reach.  High quality fabrics and supportive seating areas guarantee that a long distance ride will be comfortable.Unfortunately for the Camry, exterior styling doesn't match up to its comfortable interior.  Despite a minor facelift in 1995, the Camry hasn't undergone any real change since its overhaul in '92.  This doesn't mean that the Camry is exactly ugly, just that it is beginning to look a little dowdy next to its competitors.This brings us to our main gripe about this car.  We know that it is dependable, comfortable, and well engineered, but for the price, (around $22,000 for a base V6 and much higher for the SE or XLE with any options) you can get into a fun-to-drive BMW 318i, a stylish Ford Taurus, or an affordable Mazda 626.  In fact, the mid-sized market is positively gluted with great cars at a reasonable cost.  So, although the Camry is a good car we recommend shopping around before you make any definite decisions on this high-priced wonder.",

A Touring Package is standard equipment on the Corolla LE model. Five new exterior colors include Silver Stream Opal, Venetian Red Pearl, Dark Emerald Pearl, Aqua Blue Metallic and Twilight Blue Pearl. The Toyota Corolla has gone through many changes since it was first introduced in 1968. Over the course of its long life, the Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan. The world has seen enough people fall in love with this car to make it the second best selling vehicle in the history of automobiles.Last year the Corolla was totally redesigned in an attempt to increase its global sales record and become the standard against which all small cars will be compared. That's a tough goal to achieve with cars like the Honda Civic and Mazda Protege filling this same segment.We think the most exciting aspect of the Corolla is under the hood. Nestled between the grille and the firewall is a 1.8-liter, all-aluminum DOHC four-cylinder engine that cranks out 120 horsepower and 122 foot-pounds of torque. This high-revving engine not only provides the Corolla with more power than the previous generation's motor, but it is 10 percent more fuel-efficient. When glued to a five-speed manual transmission, this engine will reward drivers with 31 mpg in the city and 38 mpg on the freeway.Equally impressive is Toyota's newfound commitment to safety. Beginning last year all Corollas were available with four-wheel antilock brakes and side-impact airbags. Those with kids will be happy to know that CE and LE models can be ordered with an integrated child seat.The car's latest body style is into its second year and we still think the look is attractive but, in typical Toyota fashion, not very exciting. Aesthetics aside, the Corolla's new shape does a good job of reducing the car's NVH level, thanks to flush-mounted side windows and sound-deadening techniques borrowed from the Lexus magicians. Also improved by the new body is the Corolla's torsional rigidity, an important factor in making this car more fun to drive than the previous version.Toyota is on a roll, offering up fine products faster than an Amway salesman at a flea market. The Corolla is sure to be a hit with the just-starting-out crowd as well as empty nesters that simply don't need a large sedan anymore.",

    "full_description": "The 2001 Toyota Prius, a gas/electric hybrid that follows in the more expensive Honda Insight's footsteps, offers space for five adults coupled with class-leading fuel economy. The 2001 Toyota Prius is currently the best hybrid on the market. Commend Toyota for taking the gasoline/electric hybrid one step further than Honda did when it released the two-seat Insight last year. The new Prius, though it gives up ultimate fuel economy for increased utility, holds five passengers and a good bit of cargo, meaning it functions as a useable family car.On sale in Japan since 1997, Toyota is keen on pointing out that Prius, and not Insight, was the first mass-produced gas/electric hybrid vehicle in the world. The company held off on introducing the model to U.S. customers until it could gauge consumer interest and boost power levels.An all-aluminum 1.5-liter gasoline engine makes 70 horsepower at 4,500 rpm, 12 more than Japan-market models. Torque is less than robust, measuring a meager 82 foot-pounds at a rather high 4,200 rpm. Variable valve timing with intelligence (VVT-i) helps maximize engine efficiency while minimizing emissions, and power is put to the ground via a continuously variable transmission driving the front wheels. With a curb weight of 2,765 pounds, we're thinking Prius is for use primarily in the city and not for blitzkrieg runs to Vegas.Like the engine, the sealed nickel-metal hydride battery pack powering the supplementary electric motor has been boosted 20 percent to 25 kilowatts (kW), resulting in 34 supplementary horsepower. Lighter than Japan-market batteries, U.S. spec power packs are also smaller, providing increased cargo area in the trunk, amounting to 11.8 cubic feet of space. Regenerative antilock brakes recharge the battery pack with each use, and if the electrical power completely depletes, the gas engine will help energize them.Driven with care, Prius will achieve 52 mpg in the city and 45 on the highway while meeting SULEV emissions standards, according to the EPA. With its 11.9-gallon gas tank, that gives the car a maximum city range of just over 600 miles.A single model is available, loaded with amenities like air conditioning, remote keyless entry, cassette stereo, power windows/locks/mirrors, height-adjustable front seats, and 14-inch alloy wheels.Gauges and controls are located in the center of the dashboard, like in Toyota's goofy Echo subcompact, to make Prius easy to configure for multiple world markets. Thanks to a tall stance, seating is upright with plenty of head- and foot room. Toyota likes to refer to Prius as a \"real car,\" intimating that Honda's hybrid Insight is not a real car. If the definition of \"real\" is capacity for more than two people and 10 cubic feet of stuff, then they're not fibbing.Whatever the case may be, it is obvious that hybrids are meeting with acceptance in the court of public opinion. Like Insight, Prius offers a viable alternative to gasoline power plants without the limitations posed by electric-only cars like the GM EV1. If your blood runs green and not red, drop by your local Toyota dealer for a test drive.",

    "full_description": "The 2000 Toyota Camry sedan receives minor updates. The exterior benefits from new front and rear styling. Camry LE models get 15-inch tires with new wheel covers while the XLE gets standard 16-inch tires. Four-cylinder models make three more horsepower than last year. Interior upgrades include an available JBL premium audio system, automatic climate control, larger buttons on the audio faceplate, imitation wood trim on XLE models, optional leather seats with driver-side power on LE models and new LE model seat fabric. The hood is now supported with struts and dampers. Comfort and a reputation for reliability make the 2000 Toyota Camry an American favorite. A home appliance on wheels. The Toyota Camry is one of America's most-favored mid-size sedans. The reasons are simple. It boasts room for five adults, can be ordered with a powerful and smooth V6, and comes with the reputation of solid Toyota reliability.The current-generation Camry debuted in 1997 and 2000 marks its first major facelift. The styling of the '97-'99 Camry was generally considered quite plain, so the new nose and tail this year are more than welcome.The Camry can be equipped for rugged family life, or plush luxury touring. There are plenty of options to choose from, but you'll have to watch what you order if you are on a tight budget. There are three different trims: base-level CE, mid-level LE, and the top-level XLE. Some of the more notable options include side airbags, traction control, a premium sound system, leather interior trim, and a power moonroof. ABS is standard on XLEs and LEs equipped with a V6 engine.The Camry's 3.0-liter V6 is a fine engine, and it produces 200 horsepower and 214 foot-pounds of torque. Acceleration is solid, and opposed to the Honda Accord or Mitsubishi Galant, the Camry's V6 can be ordered with a manual transmission. Braking is swift and sure with the antilock system, and Camry hangs on well in corners despite rather meek all-season radials.Inside, controls and gauges are laid-out nicely in a flowing dashboard. The switches and stalks all have a solid and proper feel to them. Storage areas are abundant and feature a deep center console, door bins, and dashboard bins. Front cupholders, the feature by which all cars are truly measured these days, accommodate 20-ounce bottles of your favorite beverage. The only negative is that you might find the seats uncomfortable.The Camry works exceptionally well as a family sedan. Fully optioned, the Camry is considerably more expensive than its domestic competitors, but given the Camry's sales success, it seems most Americans consider the Camry to be a worthwhile investment.",

It would seem buyers of full-sized sedans generally aren't interested in character. Most big four-doors are dull pieces of machinery to look at and a snooze to drive. The beauty in such a vehicle lies in what it can do for the customer in terms of providing space for people and things without compromising the ride or occupant comfort. It should look upscale, but not gaudy, providing just enough glitz and luxury to let others know you have achieved a degree of success in life. Finally, such a vehicle must also be reliable and able to handle years of daily-driver tasks without so much as a whimper. Since its introduction in 1995, the Toyota Avalon has fit this description: bland as egg whites, but solid, roomy, and dependable. Last year, the Avalon was redesigned. Substantial changes improved its already attractive qualities, but its mission in the grand scheme of things, ersatz Buick, remained the same.   There are two models to choose from: XL and XLS. The main difference between the two is the level of standard equipment, with XLS representing the more luxurious version with JBL audio, programmable HomeLink remote system, remote keyless entry, and aluminum wheels. Either can be ordered with front bucket or bench seats trimmed in available leather upholstery. Avalon's 3.0-liter V6 engine features a variable valve timing system (Toyota calls its system VVT-i). It provides additional horsepower, improved fuel economy and torque, lower emissions and smoother shifting. The previous Avalon was no slouch in the power department, so the recent engine improvements are icing on an already refined cake.Toyota also updated the styling. A side benefit of this is a reduction in noise, vibration and harshness (NVH), not that it was a substantial problem in the first place. There's also increased trunk volume, grocery bag hooks, and a larger storage tray and cargo net. Vehicle Skid Control (VSC), which includes traction and stability control systems, can be added to Avalon XLS. VSC utilizes the braking system to correct understeer or oversteer conditions in a turn. Traction control reduces tire slippage during acceleration. Avalon also features a brake-assist system that detects emergency braking and applies supplemental line pressure to reduce stopping distances. Other safety features include a body structure that effectively absorbs and diffuses energy along predictable paths, energy-absorbing material in the roof rails, front pillar and center pillar to help reduce potential head injury, and super-sized rearview mirrors. With Avalon, Toyota meets and exceeds the full-size sedan buyer's expectations. Sure, the price is higher than offerings from Detroit like the Buick LeSabre, Chrysler Concorde and Mercury Grand Marquis.  But unflappable quality doesn't come cheap. Want a Lexus but need six-passenger capacity or huge amounts of rear legroom? The Avalon is your car. ",

Dual power-sliding doors are optional, and the safety-conscious will like the fact that side airbags and a stability control system are available. Sienna's smooth V6 makes more power and torque this year. A rear defroster is standard on all Siennas, while JBL audio, heated front seats and an electrochromic rearview mirror with integrated compass are optional on XLE models. Styling has been tweaked front and rear, four new colors replace four old colors and all Siennas come with a driver-side sliding door. No more exciting than a toaster, but comes close to being the perfect minivan appliance. Despite the fact that it's four model years old and doesn't offer as much utility and functionality as newer competitors, the Toyota Sienna is one of the top choices in the minivan class. With the Sienna, Toyota has placed an emphasis on safety, quality, and performance.There are three models: the base CE, the mid-level LE, and the top-level XLE. All come standard with five doors for 2001. Under the hood is a smooth, powerful, and refined 3.0-liter V6 mated to a four-speed automatic transmission that drives the front wheels. This same powertrain setup can also be found in the Toyota Camry, fitting since the Sienna is built on a stretched and modified Camry platform. In the Sienna, the engine produces 210 horsepower and 220 foot-pounds of torque, both figures up from last year thanks to the addition of variable valve timing technology.Sienna's rigid and lightweight unitized body performed exceptionally well in government crash tests. For 2001, Sienna's safety record is enhanced by newly optional side airbags and an available stability control system. Other standard safety features include ABS, front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters, front height-adjustable seatbelt anchors, and daytime running lights. Every Sienna is also equipped with a low tire-pressure warning system.The Sienna driving experience is similar to the Camry in that it's pleasantly non-confrontational. Steering is sure, if not quite nimble. The suspension does a good job of soaking up road imperfections, and wind noise is kept to a minimum. Braking is exceptionally competent. Acceleration from the V6 is acceptable for almost all situations, and the cabin is quiet at highway speeds.Sienna was designed to offer optimum interior roominess in a compact, easy-to-maneuver package. The interior has a definite Camry feel to it, constructed and trimmed in high-quality materials. Removable modular seating allows for custom configurations to accommodate a variety of cargo requirements. A second-row bench seat or captain's chairs and third-row seats can be folded or removed to accommodate bulkier cargo. Third-row seats also add a 50/50 split-folding and tumble feature for additional cargo space, but can't match many competitors for overall user-friendliness. Dual power-operated sliding side doors are optional this year.What Sienna needs to remain competitive in the class is a third-row seat that tumbles into the floor like newer models from Honda and Mazda. More comfortable front seats would help, too, as the current chairs are firm yet unsupportive, and don't offer a wide enough range of adjustment.Overall, Toyota does not make the biggest or most useful minivan, but it does make a reliable, safe, good-performing and refined alternative to a number of family haulers on the market.",

New exterior features include a front bumper redesign, multireflector headlamps and an enhanced sport package with fender flares and a hood scoop on the SR5 model. Inside, a new center console/cupholder design will improve beverage-carrying capacity of the 4Runner and an automatic climate control system will be featured on the Limited models. In 1996, Toyota separated this high-volume SUV from its pickup truck roots. Thus, the current 4Runner shares little with the Tacoma pickup. As a result, engineers have created a refined vehicle without sacrificing tough off-road ability. Generous suspension travel and tread width provide capable off-road ability, ride and handling. The interior is quite roomy, thanks to a wheelbase that is two inches longer than the previous version. A low floor and wide doors make getting into and out of the 4Runner less of an exercise in contortionism than those riding in Jeep Cherokees or Nissan Pathfinders are likely to experience.Two engines are available on the 4Runner: a 2.7-liter inline four cylinder that makes 150 horsepower at 4800 rpm and 177 foot-pounds of torque at 4000 rpm; and a 3.4-liter V6, producing 183 horsepower at 4800 rpm and 217 foot-pounds of torque at 3600 rpm. These figures represent a substantial improvement over the previous anemic four cylinder and wheezy V6. In fact, the 2.7-liter four is more powerful than the 1995 model's 3.0-liter six, and is nearly as powerful as the base engine found in the Ford Explorer XL.Needless to say, all of this adds up to a competitive sport-ute. Safety isn't ignored in the 4Runner, either, which sports dual airbags and standard antilock brakes on V6 models. (Antilock brakes are optional on four-cylinder models.)Overall, the 4Runner is a nice truck which provides the sophistication that we have come to expect from Toyota products with the overall ruggedness more often associated with Jeeps. Prices are high, however, running from $21,000 for a 2WD four-cylinder Base model to over $36,000 for a fully-loaded Limited. This lands the 4Runner Limited right smack dab in Mercedes-Benz ML320, Nissan Pathfinder LE and Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited territory. The competition in this segment is getting fierce and there are plenty of good choices for your money, definitely something worth considering when shelling out such a large chunk of change.",

    "full_description": "Based on the same platform as the Lexus RX 300, Toyota's new Highlander SUV represents the best blend of a station wagon, a minivan and a sport utility available on the market today. Available only with a V6 and an automatic transmission driving power to the front or all the wheels, Highlander will be sold in one trim level with a Limited package listed on the option sheet. An oversized Camry wagon that went equipment- and clothes-shopping at REI. Did you know that one out of every 10 cars and trucks sold in the U.S. is a Lexus or a Toyota? With the new Highlander, Toyota will easily cement itself as one of the best-selling brands in North America. How can we be so sure? Because the Highlander represents an optimum blend of three utilitarian types of vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan and the sport-utility vehicle.Based on the same platform as the Lexus RX 300, which itself is based on modified Toyota Camry mechanicals, Highlander is longer, taller and wider where the wheels meet the pavement than the Lexus. Despite its greater size, the Highlander is lighter than the RX 300, so acceleration should equal or better its upscale cousin. Braking will likely prove impressive, too. Highlander comes standard with four-wheel disc brakes equipped with electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (which maximizes braking power during a panic stop).Highlander is rated to tow 3,500 pounds, when properly equipped. Helping to meet that specification is the same 3.0-liter V6 that resides under the hood of the RX. Making 220 horsepower at 5,800 rpm and 222 ft-lbs. of torque at 4,400 rpm, the V6 features Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i). The standard engine, also using VVT-i to maximize power and efficiency, is a 2.4-liter inline four making 155 ponies and 163 ft-lbs. of twist. The four-speed automatic transmission provides a \"snow mode\" for easy starts on slippery surfaces.With 7.3 inches of ground clearance (6.9 on front-wheel drivers) and a fully independent suspension front and rear, Highlander isn't designed to tackle tough terrain. But it'll work great during heavy snowfalls. Toyota's Vehicle Skid Control (VSC) system, which includes traction control, is optional, and is designed to recognize when the Highlander isn't responding to the driver's steering inputs. VSC will then apply selective braking to bring the truck (car?) back under control.In the event it fails (not likely, but possible), Highlander protects occupants with whiplash injury lessening (WIL) front seats, five three-point seatbelts equipped with automatic and emergency locking retractors (ALR/ELR), front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters and ISO-FIX child seat anchors. Daytime running lights and side airbags are optional.Inside, Highlander delivers 38.5 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear 60/40 split folding seat in use, and a whopping 81.4 cubes when it's folded. Air conditioning, CD/cassette combo stereo with six speakers, cruise control, tilt steering wheel, bottle holders, and grocery bag hooks are standard. Opting for Limited trim gives you JBL sound, automatic climate control, remote keyless entry, woodgrain interior trim, alloy wheels with full-size spare, fog lights, privacy glass and other upgraded features. Leather upholstery is available on V6 models.Toyota is planning to sell 70,000 Highlanders in calendar year 2001. We'll bet demand outstrips supply.",

    "full_description": "A few minor changes are in store for Toyota's large sedan. On the outside, you'll find freshened styling that consists of a new grille, new taillamps and redesigned bumpers. Inside, the 2003 Avalon has been upgraded with dual-stage airbags and ISO-FIX child safety seat anchor points. XLS models also have more features this year, including an autodimming driver-side mirror, rain-sensing wipers, a simulated wood-trimmed steering wheel and an optional navigation system. A comfortable, though pasteurized, full-size sedan. Introduction: It would seem buyers of full-size sedans generally aren't interested in character. Most big four-doors are dull pieces of machinery to look at and a snooze to drive. The beauty in such a vehicle lies in what it can do for the customer in terms of providing space for people and things without compromising the ride or occupant comfort. It should look upscale, but not gaudy, providing just enough glitz and luxury to let others know you have achieved a degree of success in life. Finally, such a vehicle must also be reliable and able to handle years of daily-driver tasks without so much as a whimper. Since its introduction in 1995, the Toyota Avalon has fit this description: bland as egg whites, but solid, roomy and dependable. It's a popular seller and often exceeds the full-size sedan-buyer's expectations. Sure, the price is higher than offerings from Detroit like the Buick LeSabre and Mercury Grand Marquis,but unflappable quality doesn't come cheap. Want a Lexus but need six-passenger capacity or huge amounts of rear legroom? The Avalon is your car.Body Styles, Trim Levels and Options: The Avalon is based on the previous-generation Camry platform and it shares the latter's main mechanical components. There are two trim levels from which to choose: XL and XLS. The main difference between the two is the level of standard equipment. XL will get you the basics like dual-zone climate control, cruise control, a CD player, a multifunction information display and power locks and windows. The XLS is the more luxurious version that adds extra features like a premium JBL audio system, HomeLink, remote keyless entry, heated outside mirrors, automatic dual-zone climate control, and aluminum wheels.The Avalon can be ordered with front bucket or bench seats trimmed in either leather or cloth upholstery. Other options, depending on trim, include a premium audio system with a six-disc in-dash CD changer, a driver's seat memory feature, heated front seats, a sunroof and a 115-volt A/C outlet capable of powering small electronic devices. Also new this year is a DVD-based navigation system.Powertrains and Performance: The Avalon relies on a 3.0-liter V6 engine. Equipped with variable valve timing, this V6 offers good fuel economy and power. It produces 210 horsepower and 220 pound-feet of torque, which is transmitted to the front wheels through a four-speed automatic. These horses are more than enough for city driving and highway passing, and owners can expect 0-to-60 mph acceleration times to take about 8 seconds.Safety: One of Avalon's strengths lies in safety. The car has earned a crash-test rating of \"Good\" (the highest possible) from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and better-than-average scores from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Side airbags are standard, and Toyota's Vehicle Skid Control (VSC), can be added to the Avalon XLS. This system includes traction and stability control systems that can reduce the chance of hazardous skids and slides. It also includes a brake-assist system that detects emergency braking and applies supplemental pressure to reduce stopping distances. All Avalons have ABS-equipped four-wheel disc brakes. Interior Design and Special Features: Toyota's full-size car is also great for transporting people and luggage. While billed as a six-passenger car with the front bench, the middle front occupant doesn't have much legroom. We recommend getting an Avalon with the comfortable and supportive bucket seats unless there is genuine need for six-passenger seating. The trunk holds 15.9 cubic feet of cargo, and there is a locking pass-through door behind the rear seat. This pass-through allows room for longer items such as skis.Driving Impressions: Road and wind noise is minimal thanks to thick side glass and substantial sound-deadening materials. Once moving, the Avalon's light steering and soft suspension make for comfortable long-distance cruising. It isn't a particularly interesting car to drive, so drivers wanting a bit of involvement will be dissapointed. But if all you're looking for is dependable and comfortable transportation with a minimum of hassles, the Avalon should serve you well.",

    "full_description": "Toyota releases the Tundra pickup-based Sequoia, a full-size SUV that represents the first serious challenge to the Chevrolet Tahoe/Suburban, Ford Expedition and GMC Yukon from across either ocean. A thoroughly capable full-size SUV that beats Ford and General Motors at their own game. Toyota is going after a sizable chunk of the full-size SUV market with the snazzy 2001 Sequoia, which slots between the 4Runner and Land Cruiser in price but not size. Larger than a Tahoe or Yukon and about the same size as an Expedition, Sequoia's length, width, height, wheelbase and interior space all measure greater than the Chevrolet and GMC, while third seat room and cargo space is larger than all three competing models. Ground clearance, at a healthy 11 inches, is substantially greater than Chevy, GMC and Ford, but Toyota only offers eight-passenger capacity, compared to a maximum of nine occupants on the Tahoe, Yukon  and Expedition. Stylistically resembling the progeny of a Tundra and a 4Runner, Sequoia is powered by a smooth and silent 4.7-liter, i-Force V8 making 240 horsepower and 315 foot-pounds of torque using regular unleaded fuel. Sequoia's V8 makes it the first Toyota truck to be certified as an ULEV (ultra-low-emission vehicle). For comparison, Toyota claims the Sequoia spews 40 percent fewer non-methane organic gases (NMOG) than the Ford Expedition with an LEV engine. Sequoia tows up to 6,500 pounds in two-wheel-drive format; four-wheelers can lug 300 fewer. Other hardware includes an independent double-wishbone front suspension complemented by a five-link live rear axle. Four-wheel disc antilock brakes are standard, while Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) is optional. Also helping protect occupants are three-point seatbelts in each seating position and optional curtain-shield side airbags. Two trim levels are available: SR5 and loaded-up Limited. The latter buys you standard gear like leather seating, power retractable exterior mirrors, dual air conditioning, seat heaters, ten-speaker JBL sound system and aluminum wheels. Limited also includes third-row seating, privacy glass, a roof rack, and a tow hitch. A power sunroof, side airbags, and VSC are optional on both editions.Sequoia will be built alongside the Tundra pickup truck near Terre Haute, Indiana. If you want one, consider this: Toyota expects to build only 60,000 Sequoias annually. We predict a serious shortfall, resulting in demand that far outstrips supply. You should probably start discussing your order with your Toyota dealer, like, yesterday.",

Color-keyed mirrors and door handles can also be had this year and the spare tire is now a full-size steel wheel with a soft cover. The mini-SUV business continues to grow with more manufacturers jumping into the fray every year. Largely comprised of car-based AWD vehicles, this new market will gain even more entrants soon as Ford, Land Rover, and Mercedes introduce small trucklets to the US. One of the early players in the game was Toyota, which recognized this potential boom early on and jumped into the action in 1996 with the RAV4.A 2.0-liter, 120-horsepower engine hooked to either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission powers the front or all four wheels of the different RAV4 models. All-wheel drive models use powertrain components from the now-defunct Celica All-Trac. Four-wheel antilock brakes are optional on all RAV4s. Minimum ground clearance is 7.5 inches on the four-door models; two-door RAV4s get .2 additional inches of clearance.The RAV4 is an adequate around town driver, handling more like the car from which its platform is derived than a traditional SUV. Power is on the low side, however; the 120-horsepower engine works hard to drag this mini-ute up even small hills. The interior is not a bad place to spend time, offering fairly comfortable seating for four adults in the four-door models. The cargo area of the four-door is larger than one would expect, too, offering more room behind the rear seat than a Ford Crown Victoria. Two-door models are fine for singles or couples without children. The rear seat is tiny, and less than 10 cubic feet of cargo volume is available with the back seat up. On the plus side, Toyota does offer the RAV4 in convertible form while Honda's CR-V only comes with a hardtop.We are fond of the RAV4, but there are a number of choices in this growing segment and we can't help but think that the more refined and powerful Honda CR-V might offer shoppers more of what they are looking for in a small truck: power, utility, and value.",

    "full_description": "Toyota's car-based Highlander SUV receives no changes this year. An oversized Camry wagon that went equipment- and clothes-shopping at REI. It's not a real SUV, but it's a really nice SUV pretender. Based on the same platform as the Lexus RX 300, which itself is based on modified Toyota Camry mechanicals, the Highlander represents an optimum blend of three utilitarian types of vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan and the sport-utility vehicle.Longer, taller and wider where the wheels meet the pavement than the Lexus, the Highlander could almost fool you into thinking you were driving a family sedan. Riding on a fully independent suspension, this SUV exhibits none of the tippiness that we've experienced in other sport-utes. There are two engine choices: a standard 2.4-liter four-cylinder or a 3.0-liter V6. The four-cylinder makes 155 horsepower and 163 pound-feet of torque, while the smooth V6 puts out 220 ponies and 222 lb-ft of twist. A four-speed automatic transmission is the only one offered, and it provides a \"snow mode\" for easy starts on slippery surfaces. Tow ratings are on the light side, the maximum being 3,500 pounds with a properly equipped V6 model.The Highlander comes in both two-wheel- and four-wheel-drive configurations. Similar to the RAV4's and Lexus RX 300's, the 4WD system applies a 50/50 torque split between the front and rear wheels on a full-time basis. In the event of tire slippage, torque is automatically applied to whichever wheel needs traction. Rather than serving serious off-road duty, the system is intended to prove useful in foul weather, as it helps the tires to maintain grip even on rain-slicked and snow-coated roads.Additional safety comes from standard antilock brakes equipped with electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (which maximizes braking power during a panic stop). Toyota also offers Vehicle Skid Control (VSC). This system, which includes traction control, is designed to recognize when the Highlander isn't responding to the driver's steering inputs. VSC will then apply selective braking to bring the vehicle back under control.Toyota also equips the Highlander with whiplash injury lessening (WIL) front seats, five three-point seatbelts equipped with automatic and emergency locking retractors (ALR/ELR), front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters and ISO-FIX child seat anchors. Daytime running lights and side airbags are optional.Inside, Highlander delivers 38.5 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear 60/40 split folding seat in use, and a whopping 81.4 cubes when it's folded. Passenger accommodations are roomy, with a high ceiling and decent legroom for all passengers. However, the rear seats should be placed higher for better thigh support, and the Highlander does not offer a third-row seat like many other mid-side SUVs do.It does get air conditioning, CD/cassette combo stereo with six speakers, cruise control, tilt steering wheel, bottle holders and grocery bag hooks as standard. Opting for Limited trim gives you JBL sound, automatic climate control, remote keyless entry, woodgrain interior trim, alloy wheels with full-size spare, foglights, privacy glass and other upgraded features. Leather upholstery is available on V6 models.On the whole, we have found the Highlander to be an extraordinarily competent station wagon/sport-utility crossover. Offering a silken ride, light-duty off-road capability, luxury content and all-weather security, this Toyota is just about everything a suburban family could ask for.",

    "full_description": "There are no significant changes for the 2006 Toyota Sequoia, though an adoption of new and more accurate SAE engine measuring procedures by Toyota have resulted in a slight drop in the amount of stated power for the V8. The 2006 Toyota Sequoia is a thoroughly capable and comfortable full-size SUV, but if you need to tow a heavy load the competition does it better. Toyota gained most of its following in America by selling small and economical cars. More recently, as its success has grown, the company's selection of products has grown in both variety and size. The Toyota Sequoia SUV was introduced in 2001 as an alternative to the smaller 4Runner and the more lavish Land Cruiser. Built alongside the Tundra pickup in Toyota's plant in Indiana, the full-size Sequoia is the largest sport-utility vehicle in the Toyota lineup. It also happens to be longer and wider than the Tahoe and about the same size as the Expedition. Yep, this is definitely a big truck. The 2006 Toyota Sequoia offers seating for eight, two- or four-wheel drive and a standard V8 engine. It also has plenty of standard and optional features, including a stability control system and a DVD-based rear entertainment system. As another bonus, the Sequoia is backed by Toyota's long-standing reputation for reliability and durability. The main advantage that competitors have over the Sequoia is higher maximum tow ratings, but if this is of no concern to you the Sequoia's ultrarefined drivetrain, great ergonomics, impeccable build quality and high-tech safety features are sure to satisfy. Under the hood is a slightly modified version of the V8 from the Tundra pickup. Displacing 4.7 liters and rated at 273 horsepower and 314 pound-feet of torque, this engine lives up to Toyota's tradition of smooth powertrains that deliver seamless power with minimal apparent effort. Despite the available torque, the Sequoia's maximum towing capacity tops out at 6,500 pounds (6,200 on four-wheel-drive models), less than most of its heavier-duty competition. The 2006 Toyota Sequoia comes standard with stability and traction control, as well as four-wheel antilock disc brakes with EBD and panic assist. Optional are seat-mounted side airbags for front occupants and side curtain airbags for first- and second-row occupants. Besides providing added protection in side impacts, these airbags will also deploy in the event of a rollover. The Sequoia received five out of five stars for driver and front-passenger protection in government frontal-impact testing. Whether on city streets or dirt trails, the 2006 Toyota Sequoia handles well for a full-size SUV, providing both a smooth ride and easy maneuverability around turns. Those hoping for explosive V8 power will be disappointed, but the Sequoia offers fully adequate acceleration and an overall refined demeanor that family buyers will find appealing. Most Toyota Sequoia models seat eight, though opting for the Limited model's luxury package drops capacity to seven. Second-row passengers are given plenty of room, and the 60/40-split bench seat can be reclined, folded or tumbled completely forward. Although there's significantly more third-row legroom than in the Tahoe, the Toyota's narrower body makes three across too close for comfort. Additionally, the Expedition and Armada offer even more leg- and shoulder room, along with the convenience of a fold-flat seat design. Toyota lists maximum cargo capacity at 128.1 cubic feet, but that's with the second-row seats unbolted from the floor (using hand tools). With the second-row seats in use, capacity measures 65.3 cubes. The Toyota Sequoia is available in two trim levels, base SR5 and Limited, with either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The SR5 is well equipped with features like 16-inch wheels; power windows, seats, mirrors and locks; a CD and cassette audio system; cruise control; and automatic climate control. Limited models come fully equipped with leather seating, a premium JBL audio system, power sunroof, a multifunction display, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, heated front seats, 17-inch alloy wheels and keyless entry. On both trucks, you can also order options like an in-dash six-disc CD changer, a navigation system, a rear-seat DVD-based entertainment system and a rear load-leveling suspension. A sport package with tubular running boards, a skid plate, load-leveling suspension and various other extras is available on the SR5, while Limited buyers can get a luxury package with second-row bucket seats, electroluminescent gauges, upgraded wood trim and seat memory.",

The 2002 Toyota Tacoma is a capable compact pickup with a variety of body styles to suit most buyers. Has a reputation for reliability, but value in question due to high asking prices. Tacoma. Toyota says it's supposed to suggest the rugged outdoors, as well as strength and adventure, but a friend of ours once quipped, \"Obviously, nobody from Toyota has actually been to Tacoma.\"  There are three body styles from which to choose: Regular Cab, Xtracab and Double Cab. Each is available with two-wheel or four-wheel drive. Toyota also offers Tacomas with a \"PreRunner\" designation. PreRunners are 2WD trucks that have the looks and heavy-duty suspension of 4WD models.Toyota expanded the Tacoma lineup last year with the Double Cab. This compact crew cab offers four full-size doors and a longer passenger compartment in the hopes of appealing to people who want a pickup and an SUV but can't afford both. In order to keep overall length reasonable for on- and off-road maneuverability, the Double Cab's bed length is shortened to 61.5 inches.For all Tacomas, any of three engines go under the hood. Two-wheel-drive Tacomas get a 2.4-liter four-cylinder base engine, rated at 142 horsepower and 160 pound-feet of torque. Tacoma 4WDs and 2WD PreRunners earn a 2.7-liter four with 150 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Standard on Double Cab and optional on Xtracab models is a 3.4-liter V6 that whips out 190 horses and 220 lb-ft of torque. Toyota also offers a special 2WD S-Runner Xtracab sport truck equipped with the V6, a five-speed manual transmission and a sport-tuned suspension. A supercharger is also available from Toyota Racing Development (TRD) for the V6, boosting output to 260 horsepower. Ask your dealer for details.Interiors are industrial in design, failing to appear modern, but are constructed of high-quality materials. Switchgear is logically placed and easy to use. Larger drivers might find the front seats to be uncomfortable, but the cabin in general is pretty roomy, especially in the Double Cab. Standard features are few and far between, however. Items like air conditioning, cruise control, bucket seats and power windows and locks are all optional. Toyota does offer two optional packages -- SR5 and Limited -- that bundle the most desired features. A TRD off-road package is also available that includes an upgraded suspension, 16-inch tires and a locking rear differential.In terms of safety equipment, all pickups contain dual front airbags with a shut-off switch for the passenger side. Four-wheel antilock brakes are optional. In government crash tests, the Tacoma has not faired as well as other compact pickups.Driving a Tacoma is easy enough thanks to its compact dimensions. Both four-cylinder engines offer adequate acceleration, though you'll want the V6 if you plan on towing. Ride quality can suffer if the TRD off-road package is ordered, but the payoff in terms of enhanced off-road ability is well worth it.Toyota hopes to attract buyers with the handsome styling and rugged image of its Tacoma as well as its reputation for quality and reliability. Generally, we like the Tacoma, but question the value it represents. Most of these Toyota trucks don't come cheap. Guess that's the price you pay for the peace of mind a Toyota provides.",

    "full_description": "A new mini-ute based on passenger car mechanicals debuts this year. It's available as a two-door or four-door. The mini-SUV market is booming.  Geo introduced a four-door Tracker this year, Suzuki spruced up the Sidekick with a more powerful engine and body cladding, and Kia dropped a bigger engine and an airbag into its Sportage.  Even the ancient Jeep Cherokee is selling like hotcakes, thanks to its powerful inline six-cylinder engine, low price, and rugged Jeep heritage.Toyota, who in the past half-decade has taken on the luxury-sedan market with Lexus, the full-sized pickup market with the T100, and the traditional full-sized sedan market with the Avalon, now has its sights set on wealth-deprived twenty- and thirty-somethings who want an SUV but can't afford to fork out 25 to 30 grand for a 4Runner.  The RAV4 (Recreational Active Vehicle with 4WD) is a new mini-SUV designed to capitalize on the low end of this booming market.All RAV4s are powered by a 2.0-liter, 120-horsepower engine, hooked to either a five-speed or automatic transmission powering the front or all wheels.  The RAV4 is the first sport utility with front-wheel drive.  All-wheel drive models use powertrain components from the now-defunct Celica All-Trac.  Four-wheel antilock brakes are optional on all models.  Minimum ground clearance is 7.5-inches on the four-door model; two-door RAV4s get an additional .2 inches.  We haven't driven the RAV4, but gave it a close examination at the Arizona Auto Show.  The four-door is comfortable and typically Toyota in materials and design.  Very functional, little flair, and durable in feel and appearance.  The rear seat is a bit cramped for six-footers, but is comfortable enough for short trips.  Fortunately, the split folding rear seat reclines a bit to increase head room.  The cargo area of the four-door is larger than one would expect, offering more room behind the rear seat than a Chevrolet Caprice Classic.  Two-door models are fine for singles or couples without children.  The rear seat is tiny, and less than 10 cubic feet of cargo volume is available with the back seat up.On paper and in person, the RAV4 is a sensible vehicle with loads of personality.  Pricing, as with many Japan-built imports, is this sport ute's main problem.  A 4WD four-door with automatic, ABS, alloy wheels, air conditioning, cruise, cassette and a tilt wheel is gonna run you $21,750.  Add power locks, windows, and mirrors and the price escalates to $22,700.  In contrast, a Kia Sportage EX runs less than $20,000 similarly equipped.  Loaded Trackers and Sidekicks are also less expensive.  Still, the Toyota is bigger inside, cuter outside, and comes standard with Toyota's reputation for quality.  For many buyers, this will be enough to close the sale.  However, we think the Jeep Cherokee is a better value than any of the mini-SUV's on the market, including the RAV4.",

We feel that this is due to its solid engineering, available safety features, and fun-to-drive attributes when equipped with a five-speed manual transmisson. The Corolla is a fine car with good handling characteristics, a well-designed interior, and attractive, if not earth-shattering, looks.  Additionally, the optional antilock brakes, better than average crash test scores and integrated child seat on DX models go a long way toward making the Corolla a reasonably affordable, safe, compact family-sedan.The wagon variant disappears for 1997, and Toyota introduces a new CE trim level that stands for Classic Edition.  The CE is essentially a Standard model with a package of upgrades not normally found on the lower level Corolla.  Corollas get revised door trim this year, and side impact beams that meet 1997 federal standards.  Nothing else new here, as Toyota prepares to retire the current edition and introduce a new, improved Corolla for 1998.Unfortunately for Toyota, there is a good reason to skip the Corolla when shopping for a new car; the Geo Prizm.  Built on the same assembly line as the Corolla, out of the same parts and by the same workers, the Prizm is everything that the Corolla is and more.

With the Avalon, Toyota takes on a traditionally Detroit-dominated section of the marketplace: the full-size sedan.  The last assault Toyota made on a domestic market was in 1993, when the T100 pickup was introduced as an alternative to big trucks from Ford, GM and Dodge.  The 1994 Dodge Ram and the lack of a V8 in the Toyota conspired to keep sales to a minimum.  We think the company has learned something from its experience with the T100.For instance, the Avalon's V6 is a powerful motor, allowing the Avalon to keep up with GM front-drivers like the LeSabre and Bonneville in acceleration, and besting the V8-powered Crown Victoria in  the race to 60 mph. Handling is on par with the Bonneville SSE, and braking is outstanding.The news for 1998 is the Avalon's mild restyle.  New this year are safety features like seat-mounted side-impact airbags, pretensioner seatbelts with force limiters and exterior revisions like a new grille, trunk lid, headlamps, taillights and bodyside moldings.Inside, the Avalon is noticeably narrower than the domestic competition, but six will fit in a pinch when equipped with the optional bench seat.  The rear seat is exceptionally comfortable, offering more leg and foot room than bigger sedans, with good support and a high seating position.Front seats are comfy as well, and face an ergonomically designed dashboard that places everything right where you expect to find it.  The styling is generic, with oversize headlights and a narrow grille imparting an out-of-balance appearance to the front end.Overall, the Avalon impresses us as an excellent alternative to aging and aesthetically impaired offerings from GM and Ford.  Chrysler's new Concorde sedan is a better value, but the guaranteed quality of the Toyota is probably worth the extra couple grand.",

    "full_description": "Toyota plays the market conservatively with the all-new Camry, giving consumers exactly what they want; a roomy, attractive, feature-laden car with available V6 performance and the promise of excellent reliability as well as resale value. The 1997 Toyota Camry is the new standard for midsize sedans. The Camry is the new standard for midsized sedans.  It has room inside for five adults, attractive yet conservative styling, exceptional pep from an available 24-valve 3.0-liter V6, and a price that doesn't break the bank so long as options are kept to a minimum.Toyota is going after the number-one sales spot with vigor.  The Camry is larger and more powerful than last year, but costs less money.  Coupe and wagon models have been dropped from the lineup, and consumers can opt for the V6 engine on base CE models for the first time.  Antilock brakes are standard on all but the most basic Camrys, and an integrated child-safety seat is optional across the board.  Buyers of V6 models can order traction control for inclement weather.The new Camry can be equipped for rugged family life, or plush luxury touring.  Options on higher-grade LE and XLE models include a premium sound system, leather interior trim, and a power moonroof.  With the V6 engine, the Camry accelerates strongly.  Braking is swift and sure with the antilock system, and Camry hangs on well in corners despite rather meek all-season radials.Inside, a two-inch increase in wheelbase has allowed designers to maximize space, creating a larger Camry than ever.  Controls and gauges are laid-out nicely in a more flowing dashboard than the previous car boasted.  Camry CE sticks with a fixed-mast stereo antenna, but LE and XLE get an in-glass antenna, which reduces wind noise.  Storage areas have been increased also, and a tissue holder is built into the center console.  Front cupholders accommodate 20-ounce bottles of your favorite beverage.Is the Camry the perfect family conveyance?  Not out of the box, but it's close.  We'd opt for a lightly-loaded CE with the V6 engine, add some aftermarket aloy wheels, and do a bit of suspension and tire work to create the ultimate sleeper of staid bread-and-butter sedans.",

XLE models add a CD deck and offer an optional in-dash six-disc changer. No more exciting than a toaster, but comes close to being the perfect minivan appliance. Now in its third model year, the Toyota Sienna is one of the top competitors in the minivan market. With the Sienna, Toyota has placed an emphasis on safety, quality, and performance.There are three models: the base CE, the midlevel LE, and the top-level XLE. The CE can be ordered with four or five doors. The LE and XLE come standard with five doors. Under the hood are a standard 3.0-liter V6 and a four-speed automatic transmission. This same powertrain setup can also be found in the Toyota Camry, as the Sienna is built on a stretched and modified Camry platform. In the Sienna, the engine produces 194 horsepower and 209 foot-pounds of torque.This rigid and lightweight unitized body does exceptionally well in government crash testing. Front driver and passenger airbags are standard, though no side airbags are offered. Other safety features include ABS, front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters, front height-adjustable seatbelt anchors, and daytime running lights. A low tire-pressure warning system is also a standard feature. The ABS wheel-speed sensors measure each wheel's rotational speed relative to the other wheels, allowing the stem to detect low pneumatic pressure in the tires.The Sienna's driving experience is similar to the Camry's in that it's pleasantly non-confrontational. Steering is sure if not quite nimble. The suspension does a good job of soaking up road imperfections, and wind noise is kept to a minimum. Acceleration from the V6 is acceptable for almost all situations.Sienna was designed to offer optimum interior roominess in a compact, easy-to-maneuver package. The interior has a definite Camry feel to it. Removable modular seating allows for custom configurations to accommodate a variety of cargo requirements. Second-row bench seats or captain's chairs and third-row seats can be folded or removed to accommodate bulkier cargo items. Third-row seats also add a 50/50 split-folding and tumble feature for additional cargo space. A power-operated passenger-side sliding door is optional.Overall, Toyota does not make the biggest minivan, but it does make a convenient alternative to either Chrysler-designed family-haulers or the Honda Odyssey. Need to trade in your old Camry to make room for another member of the family? Toyota has a built-in answer to your dilemma. And it's hoping you see it that way, too.",

    "full_description": "A new 4Runner with a potent V6, updated styling and more interior room debuts. After a successful five-year run, the second-generation Toyota 4Runner has been retired, and not a moment too soon.  Fresh in 1990, the 4Runner aged quickly as the sport-utility market exploded and other automakers introduced larger, safer and more powerful rivals.  By 1995, the compact pickup-based 4Runner offered little, other than Toyota's reputation for reliability, to entice buyers.For 1996, Toyota has separated this high-volume SUV from its pickup truck roots.  The new 4Runner shares little with the Tacoma pickup.  As a result, engineers have created a more refined vehicle without sacrificing tough off-road ability.  Suspension travel and tread width are both up to improve off-road ability, ride, and handling.  The interior is larger in every direction, thanks to a wheelbase that is two inches longer than the previous version.  A lower floor and wider doors make getting into and out of the 4Runner less of an exercise in contortionism.  Rear leg room is up by three inches, and cargo space has been improved as well.Two engines are available on the 4Runner: a 2.7-liter inline four cylinder that makes 150 horsepower at 4800 rpm and 177 foot-pounds of torque at 4000 rpm., and a 3.4-liter V6 producing 183 horsepower at 4800 rpm and 217 foot-pounds of torque at 3600 rpm.  These figures represent a substantial improvement over the old anemic four cylinder and wheezy V6 -- in fact, the new 2.7-liter four is more powerful than the 1995 model's 3.0-liter six.Needless to say, all of this adds up to a much improved sport-ute.  Safety hasn't been ignored in the revamped 4Runner, which sports dual airbags.  Antilock brakes are standard with the V6 and optional on four-cylinder models.  Steering response and feel have also been improved by replacing the old recirculating ball-type steering with a rack and pinion setup.  Access to the cargo area is improved by switching from a two-piece tailgate to a one-piece hatch-style liftgate with a power-down rear window.Also new are 20-ounce cupholders, a bigger console storage area, and relocated rear speakers.  Seven new exterior colors debut, and all new interior fabrics and designs round out the new 4Runner package.  Overall, a very nice effort, resulting in a tough truck with looks to match.  Pricing runs from $20,000 for a 2WD four cylinder Base model to $36,000 for a fully loaded Limited.  This lands the 4Runner right smack dab in Tahoe, Explorer and Grand Cherokee territory.

In other news, a new trim has been introduced; the Limited Edition Camry comes in an exclusive crystal-white color, and offers a unique front grille, standard foglamps and champagne-color exterior badging.

    "full_description": "The RAV4 SUV remains largely unchanged for 2000.  A new cupholder design and the extinction of the two-door RAV4 convertible are the big news for '00. A solid and pleasing package, if a tad bit small. The mini-SUV business continues to grow with more manufacturers jumping into the fray every year. Largely comprised of car-based AWD vehicles, the territory of this market has been staked out by Chevrolet, Honda, Kia, Nissan, Subaru, and Suzuki. Toyota, too, recognized this potential boom early on and jumped into the action with the introduction of the '96 RAV4. A 2.0-liter, 127-horsepower engine hooked to either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission powers the front or all four wheels of the different RAV4 models. All-wheel-drive versions use powertrain components from the long-defunct Celica All-Trac. Four-wheel antilock brakes are optional on all RAV4s. Minimum ground clearance measures 7.5 inches.The RAV4 is an adequate around-town driver, handling more like the car from which its platform is derived than a traditional SUV. Power is on the low side, however. It offers some initial pep when pulling away from stoplights, but any serious attempt at acceleration results in nothing more than noise and vibration. The engine gets particularly obnoxious above 4,500 rpm where underhood clatter is enough to stifle conversation between passengers. This would be more acceptable if accompanied by even a modest form of forward thrust. Unfortunately, it's not. The interior is not a bad place to spend time. The ventilation controls are easy to understand, the stereo outstanding, and the individual bucket seats are quite comfortable. Even with the rear seat up, cargo space is a healthy 26.8 cubic feet. Fold down the second seat and that number jumps to 57.9 \"moving-into-my-first-dorm-room\" cubic feet. Adults placed in back will most likely whine about a lack of legroom, however.While the RAV4 was never a hot rod, its lack of power when first introduced was forgivable in a world of Sidekicks and used Amigos. But with Honda CR-V making 145 horsepower, Suzuki offering a V6 Grand Vitara, and Nissan fielding a 170-hp Xterra, the RAV4 is rapidly becoming an \"also ran\" in this burgeoning market. Throw in 200-hp V6 competitors from Mazda and Ford, and Toyota could find themselves in a rare position for this company: at the bottom of the heap.",

Safety equipment includes standard antilock brakes, low tire-pressure warning systems and five-mph front and rear bumpers. Sienna boasts outstanding crash test scores. Just when you thought it was safe to call the minivan market dead, Toyota does the unthinkable and makes this typically boring corner of automobilia interesting.  Toyota's new minivan sits in sharp contrast to the one it replaces.  Whereas the Previa was a study in minivan abnormalities, with rear-wheel drive, a midship-mounted supercharged engine and a shape that looked like the droid escape pod from the first Star Wars movie, the Sienna is a model of suburban respectability.That doesn't, however, mean that this minivan is boring.  Resting under the hood is a powerful 3.0-liter V6 engine that was stolen from the Camry parts bin.  The engine isn't the only piece of equipment  pilfered from the Camry; the Sienna rides on a stretched and modified Camry platform and uses much of the Camry's interior switchgear.  Appropriately referred to internally at Toyota as \"The Camry of minivans,\" we can only assume that the company expects this creation to be as popular as their recently redesigned sedan.In order to harness the 194 horses at work under the hood, engineers put antilock brakes at all four wheels of every Sienna.  Other safety equipment includes dual airbags, side-impact protection that meets future federal standards and seatbelt pretensioners for both front seats.  Toyota is so confident in this vehicle's crashworthiness that they proclaim in their press kit that it will deliver \"best-in-class\" in tests administered by third parties.  The claim has been substantiated.  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety conducted an offset crash test of the Sienna and called it \"the best performing vehicle in the history of the test.\"Interestingly, Toyota was able to talk rivals General Motors and Chrysler into lending a hand on the Sienna's manufacturing process.  Not used to making such a large vehicle, Toyota had questions about how to deal with the interior assembly of this van that has well over 130 cubic feet of cargo space.In the end, General Motors and Chrysler may be sorry that they offered to help Toyota figure out some of their manufacturing logistics.  Toyota is expecting to sell 70,000 of these minvans annually.  If  they increase capacity, they could become a real thorn in the side of the Big Three that has heretofore dominated the minivan industry.  Whatever the case may be, we have no hesitation about recommending this outstanding, if somewhat homely, minivan.",

Back in 1996, the term \"cute ute\" was coined when Toyota released the RAV4, an acronym for Recreational Activity Vehicle with 4WD. While Suzuki had been plying these waters for years with the Sidekick (and its Chevy Tracker twin), it wasn't until the car-based RAV hit the market that small SUVs became popular.For 2001, Toyota has redesigned the RAV4. Available in five-door wagon configuration, the new RAV is taller, wider, longer and heavier than the original flavor, which results in more cabin space. To offset the weight gain, a new, all-aluminum, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is under the hood, mated to either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic driving the front or all wheels.Making 148 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 142 foot-pounds of torque at a lofty 4,000 rpm, a front-wheel-drive RAV4 with a stick shift should accelerate from zero to 60 mph in about 10.5 seconds. Adding weight, in the form of 4WD, passengers, cargo or an automatic transmission, will slow the already sluggish RAV in the stoplight drag race. Toyota needs to offer more power. Despite the inclusion of variable valve timing with intelligence (VVT-i), the new, larger, and heavier RAV4 has difficulty getting to speed. But, on a positive note, the RAV4 is certified a low emission vehicle.Exterior styling takes cues from the existing RAV4, and melds them with a dash of Lexus RX 300 here and Infiniti QX4 there, which is entirely a good thing. Inside, overtones of Celica can be seen in the gauge cluster, steering wheel, and metallic trim pieces. Overall, the RAV has been nicely tidied up, while still adhering to the tenets of the cute ute philosophy.Standard equipment is sparse, with most of the good stuff like antilock brakes, aluminum wheels, air conditioning, remote keyless entry and a power sunroof optional. An option package bundles power windows, doors and locks with A/C, cruise control and a six-speaker sound system with both cassette and CD players. Upgrade to the \"L\" package and you get these goodies plus heated exterior mirrors, floor mats, dark tinted glass, fog lights, and special exterior trim. The \"L\" package is also your ticket to leather upholstery. A limited-slip differential is a stand-alone option on 4WD versions.New whiplash-preventing seats, combined with added passenger room, make the RAV more comfortable. Cargo area has also grown, to a maximum of 68.3 cubic feet with the rear bench seat removed (space measures 29.2 cubic feet with the back seat in use).Five new colors are available: Titanium, Impulse Red, Vintage Gold, Rainforest Mica, and Spectra Blue Mica. They complement carryover colors Natural White and Black, and all can be mated to either Gray or Oak (or both) interior hues.Equip one with leather, and you just might confuse it with a Land Cruiser -- from a distance.

The last assault Toyota made on a domestic market was in 1993, when the T100 pickup was introduced as an alternative to big trucks from Ford, GM, and Dodge. The introductions of the 1994 Dodge Ram and the lack of a V8 in the Toyota conspired to keep sales to a minimum. We think the company has learned something from its experience with the T100.For instance, the Avalon's V6 is a powerful motor allowing the car to compete with GM front-drivers, like the LeSabre and Bonneville, in acceleration. Handling is on par with the Bonneville SSE, and braking is outstanding.Inside, the Avalon is noticeably narrower than the domestic competition, but six will fit in a pinch when equipped with the optional bench seat. The rear seat is exceptionally comfortable, offering more leg and foot room than bigger sedans, with good support and a high seating position.Front seats are comfy as well, and face an ergonomically designed dashboard that places everything right where you expect to find it. The styling is generic, with oversize headlights and a narrow grille imparting an out-of-balance appearance to the front end. Of course, if this car is truly trying to compete with domestic sedans, this styling is right on the money.Overall, the Avalon impresses us as an excellent alternative to aging and aesthetically impaired offerings from GM and Ford.

Generally, we like the Tacoma, but question the value it represents. Most of these Toyota trucks don't come cheap. Guess that's the price you pay for the peace of mind a Toyota provides.",

    "full_description": "The Prius Prime, the plug-in version of the current, recently revised Prius, replaces the Prius Plug-in. A larger battery gives more electric-only range than the outgoing Prius Plug-in, while its fuel efficiency in hybrid mode edges higher than that of the base Prius. Compared to the base Prius, the Prius Prime packs a  larger battery that supports approximately 25 miles of electric-only range and,  crucially, can be recharged by plugging into an electrical port. Replenishing  the battery via a regular wall 120-volt socket takes about 5.5 hours, while a  Level 2 (240-volt) charger shortens this time to a little more than two hours.  Of course, you could also choose to never plug it in and simply refuel with  gasoline, and it will operate simply as a more efficient Prius.  Accommodating the larger lithium-ion battery meant  turning the Prius Prime it into a four-seater (the regular Prius seats five)  and raising the loading height of its cargo area. To recoup some of the lost  cargo space, the Prime is 6.5 inches longer than the base Prius; most of that  extra length extends aft of the rear wheels. The bigger battery adds weight,  too, a change that the suspension struggles to deal with at times. Among plug-in hybrids, the 2017 Toyota Prius Prime stands out for its fuel economy and accessible price. Its electric-only range has grown substantially, though it comes at the cost of a few passenger and cargo space compromises. The suspension struggles to manage the extra weight of the Prime's larger battery pack. One result is exaggerated motions over rises and crests. Though the range-topping Advanced trim level is packed with a long list of tech features, it commands a large premium over the others. Going with the mid-grade Premium trim level is the approach we recommend because the Premium better aligns with the Prius Prime's value proposition. It's also the cheapest way to get the significantly larger (11.6-inch) central touchscreen, which is a big improvement over the base 7-inch screen. In the bargain, the Premium adds upgraded cabin materials and a power driver seat, plus keyless entry/start and wireless smartphone charging.  The Plus trim level isn\u2019t quite bare-bones,  but you know you\u2019re in the base model. It has a 7-inch multimedia screen, cloth  seats with manual adjustments, Bluetooth, a USB port and keyless entry for the  driver only.  Stepping  up one rung to the Premium trim  level puts you into the Prius Prime\u2019s sweet spot. It includes a power driver  seat, an 11.6-inch central touchscreen and upgraded multimedia system, premium  synthetic leather (SofTex) seats, automatic headlights, keyless entry on three  doors, satellite radio and wireless smartphone charging. The Advanced trim level adds a raft of  technology features: premium audio, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic  alert, a heated steering wheel, an auto-dimming mirror, a head-up display, a  smartphone app with a charge management system and remote climate control  operation, rain-sensing wipers and a semi-automated parking function.",

    "full_description": "The 1998 Toyota Corolla is completely redesigned this year with a new engine, new sheet metal and a new standard for safety in compact cars: optional front passenger side-impact airbags. The Toyota Corolla has been through many iterations since it was first introduced in 1968.  Over the course of its long life, the Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan.  The world has seen enough people fall in love with this car to make it the second best selling vehicle in  history. Totally redesigned, the new Toyota Corolla is set to increase its global sales record and become the  standard against which all small cars will be compared.  Why?  Because there is nothing like it, other than the re-badged Chevrolet Prizm, that carries this level of refinement and convenience in the sub-$20,000 price class. We think that the most exciting change to the Corolla occurs under the car's hood.  Nestled between the grille and the firewall is a 1.8-liter all-aluminum DOHC four-cylinder engine that cranks out 120 horsepower and 122 foot-pounds of torque.  This high-revving engine not only provides the Corolla with more power than last year's motor, it does so while being 10 percent more fuel-efficient.  When glued to a  five-speed manual transmission, this engine will reward drivers with 31 mpg in the city and 38 mpg on the freeway. Equally impressive is Toyota's newfound commitment to safety.  In 1998 all Corollas are available with four-wheel antilock brakes and side-impact airbags.  You heard that right, Toyota's bargain-priced Corolla is the cheapest car that driver's concerned about their safety can outfit with seat-mounted side airbags.   Those with kids will be happy to know that CE and LE models can be ordered with an integrated child seat.   Also new in 1998 is the car's body.  We think the new look is attractive, but this little sedan  follows typical Toyota policy and does nothing that will visually offend.  This unfortunately means that  there is nothing visually exciting about the car, either.  Aesthetics aside, the Corolla's new shape does a good job of reducing the cars NVH levels, thanks to flush-mounted side windows and sound-deadening techniques borrowed from the Lexus magicians.  Also improved by the new body is the Corolla's torsional rigidity, an important factor in making this car more fun to drive than its predecessor. Toyota is on a roll, offering up fine products faster than an Amway salesman at a flea market.  The Corolla is sure to be a hit with the just-starting-out crowd as well as empty nesters that simply don't need a large sedan anymore.  Levels of safety and refinement usually don't come this cheap.  We predict that the Corolla will steal plenty of sales from the Honda Civic and Nissan Altima.",

    "full_description": "Pricing for optional value packages has been lowered for all trim lines. Reliable but bland, the Corolla is a conservative pick in the economy sedan class. Toyota's venerable Corolla has gone through many changes since it was first introduced in 1968. Over the course of its long life, the Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan. The world has seen enough people fall in love with this car to make it the best-selling nameplate in the history of automobiles. Now, while that's neat and all, we're sure that what's really important to you and your wallet is whether this modern Corolla still has what it takes to stomp out its competitors. In short, it doesn't.Dating to 1998, the current Corolla faces stiff competition from the Ford Focus, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Mazda Protege and Nissan Sentra, all of which have been substantially redesigned or newly introduced since this particular Toyota was fresh out of the blocks. And they are all more satisfying cars, both in terms of comparable feature content as well as driving experience. To help fend them off until the next redesign, the Corolla comes equipped with a zippy, smooth-revving 1.8-liter four-cylinder aluminum engine that cranks out 125 horsepower, thanks to a variable valve timing and lift system that Toyota calls VVT-i. VVT-i employs continuously variable intake valve timing to provide greater engine performance, better fuel economy and reduced pollution over a wide rev range. When equipped with a manual transmission, this car pulls strongly. Automatic gearboxes are available, too, including a technologically advanced (not!) three-speed unit on base models.Three trim levels are available on the 2002 Corolla: the base CE, better-equipped LE and sporty S. The S model includes \"sporty\" trim such as body-colored rocker panels and door handles, foglights, fake leather-wrapped steering wheel and a tachometer with outside temperature display. Step up to the LE to get power mirrors, a 60/40 split folding rear bench and a tilting steering wheel. Our biggest gripe with the Corolla is minimal legroom for both the driver and passengers and the horribly uncomfortable seats. Center stack ergonomics also aren't up to standards in the class, and the soft suspension keels over in turns, making the tires howl in pain. But the ride is smooth, the cabin is quiet at speed, side airbags are an unusual option for the class, and the parts used in the car's construction exude quality; a good thing, since many of the interior trim pieces are shared throughout the Toyota lineup.Few competitors can match Toyota's run-forever reputation and high levels of build quality. But with several superior cars competing for slices of the econo-sedan pie, Toyota has its work cut out for it in 2002.",

    "full_description": "For the 1996 Toyota Tacoma, Regular Cab 4WD models can be equipped with a new Off-Road Package. Toyota's sixth-generation compact pickup debuted in April, as a 1995.5 model, with an actual model name: Tacoma.  It's supposed to suggest the rugged outdoors, as well as strength and adventure.  Any of three potent new engines goes under the hood, and the pickup rides an all-new chassis.  Toyota aimed at aggressive styling, inside and out, and Tacomas sport an excellent selection of interior fittings.  Regular and extended Xtracab bodies are available, with either two- or four-wheel drive.  A deep-sculpted grille/hood/fender structure imparts a sporty personality to the truck, to attract customers who select their 4x4s on non-utilitarian grounds. Two-wheel-drive Tacomas get a 2.4-liter four-cylinder base engine, rated 142 horsepower (26 more than the prior generation). Tacoma 4x4s earn a 150-horsepower, 2.7-liter four.  Toyota claims that its four-cylinder engines are comparable to V6s from competitors.  But if those won't suffice, consider the latest V6 option: a dual-overhead-cam, 24-valve unit that whips out 190 horses and 220 foot-pounds of torque.  With V6 power, borrowed from the bigger T100, this compact pickup can tow up to 5,000 pounds and soundly whip any factory sport truck in the stoplight dragrace.  In contrast, the V6 engine available in the prior-generation pickup delivered only 150 horsepower and 180 foot-pounds.All Tacomas have front coil springs instead of the former torsion bars, but 4x4s feature longer suspension travel than before, to improve ride/handling qualities, whether on- or off-road.  Track width has been increased, too, for a more stable ride.  Rack-and-pinion steering replaces the old recirculating-ball layout, for better feel and response.  Manual-shift trucks feature reverse-gear synchronization, to reduce gear noise when shifting into reverse.  Four-wheel antilock braking is an option, but all pickups contain an airbag for the driver.  In top-of-the-line SR5 Xtracab pickups, a One-Touch Hi-4 switch is available for easy, pushbutton engagement of four-wheel-drive.  By redesigning and lowering the floor by 1.6 inches, Toyota makes 4x4s easier to enter.Tacomas are produced at the NUMMI joint-venture facility in Fremont, California, having been designed in that state.  Options include cruise control, air conditioning, a sliding rear window, tilt steering wheel, and moonroof.  We like the Tacoma, but question the value it represents.  These new Toyota trucks don't come cheap.  Guess that's the price you pay for the peace of mind a Toyota provides.",

    "full_description": "As  three-row family vehicles go, Toyota's Highlander is among the most practical  and easiest to drive. It's easy to see out of and comfortable for both city  driving and long highway trips. High fuel economy for a conventionally powered  SUV is another draw. And if you want a more efficient or bigger Highlander,  there's always the gas/electric Hybrid or the supersized Grand Highlander to  consider. \nCredit  for Highlander's above-average fuel economy goes to its turbocharged  four-cylinder engine, which is an unconventional choice in this class. Most  midsize three-row SUVs use bigger V6 engines, many of which are more powerful.  The Highlander's four-cylinder is noisier and a bit rougher in operation than  the many competitors' V6s, but overall we still like its powertrain. The  Highlander's eight-speed automatic responds quickly and is a good pairing with  the turbo-four's power delivery. The Highlander is available in front- or  all-wheel drive.\nWe  also like the Highlander's generous allocation of features across its many  trims. Premium\u00a0features like a 12.3-inch  infotainment screen and a power liftgate are available in the midlevel  trims. And wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone  integration is standard across all trims.\nOn  the downside, the Highlander's third-row seats are pretty cramped, and there's  not much space behind that row for storage. Other rivals such as the Honda  Pilot, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride and Volkswagen Atlas provide more room.  But overall, we think the  2023 Highlander is a likable enough SUV to warrant consideration.  Toyota  hasn't released the information on the 2024 Highlander as of this writing.  We'll update our recommendations if anything changes, but based on last year's  Highlander we recommend the midrange XLE trim. For a reasonable  premium over the supporting trims, you get several niceties such as heated  front seats, synthetic leather upholstery, second-row sunshades and a wireless  charging pad.",

    "full_description": "Toyota's  Highlander is one of the most well-known three-row midsize SUVs around. It's a  great choice for growing families and offers versatility similar to a minivan  but is more enjoyable to drive and easier to maneuver in most cases. The 2023  Highlander is based on the most recent generation Highlander that debuted in  2020 and receives some updates this year.  \nMost  notably, Toyota has dropped the Highlander's previous V6 engine in favor of a  new turbocharged four-cylinder. It's down on horsepower compared to its  predecessor but makes more torque. The new engine feels more substantial than  you'd expect from a smaller four-cylinder engine in a vehicle this large. Power  delivery is smooth, and the engine and eight-speed automatic transmission work  in harmony to respond quickly to throttle inputs and get the SUV up to speed  easily. The new four-cylinder engine also gets slightly higher EPA-estimated  fuel economy than the old V6, helping to make this one of more fuel-efficient  three-rows on the market. But it's also a lot noisier than the old V6 when you  accelerate aggressively, and that can get annoying.\nInside,  the digital information display on the Limited and Platinum trim levels grows  from 7 inches to 12.3 inches, matching the size of the central touchscreen on  those trims. The 12.3-inch touchscreen is now optional on the midtier XLE and  XSE, allowing more price-conscious shoppers to upgrade the infotainment system  if they want. Those models also get the hands-free liftgate that used to come  standard on more expensive levels. Finally, wireless connectivity for Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto comes standard across the lineup.\nWhile  these 2023 changes are certainly welcome, they don't address the Highlander's  rear space drawbacks and do little to impact the bottom line. We're more likely  to recommend the Highlander Hybrid, which is covered in a separate review on  Edmunds. The Hybrid doesn't cost much more than the standard Highlander and  gets significantly better fuel economy. For non-hybrid models, the 2023 Toyota  Highlander falls short of the mark set by the dominant Kia Telluride and  related Hyundai Palisade. The praiseworthy Honda Pilot is all-new for 2023 and  has a chance to reclaim its class-leading position. \nOverall,  the 2023 Highlander is a likable enough SUV. But its easy-driving nature and  high fuel economy may not be enough to surpass our favorites in the class.  That's why we suggest a thorough comparison test drive to see which SUV fits  your life the best.  The  midrange XLE trim gets our recommendation for its balance of price versus  features. For a reasonable premium over the supporting trims, you get several  niceties such as heated front seats, faux leather upholstery, second-row  sunshades and a wireless charging pad. It also comes with second-row captain's  chairs, but you can swap them out for a three-seat bench as a no-cost option.",

    "full_description": "Everybody  has a Toyota Corolla story. This compact car made Toyota a household brand in  the U.S. well before there was a Camry, a RAV4 or a Tacoma, making a name for  itself with its dependability, fuel efficiency and practicality. Those traits  continue to define the modern Toyota Corolla, which gets numerous updates for  the 2023 model year. \nThe  hot news for 2023 is the introduction of the rally-inspired GR Corolla. We  cover this high-performance hatchback in a separate review, so if the standard  Corolla looks a bit tame to you, the GR should be exactly what you're looking  for. Toyota also expands the Corolla Hybrid lineup for 2023, adding several  trim levels to make that high-mileage version of the sedan more appealing. You  can read all about it in our separate review of the Corolla Hybrid.\nHere,  we're focused on the volume-selling Corolla sedan models. In addition to  styling updates, the 2023 Corolla gets some technology enhancements. Toyota has  upgraded the touchscreen interface to include a lot more features than the  prior system. There's available navigation, more robust voice command  capabilities for many of the car's features and controls (\"Hey,  Toyota\" is the prompt), and the ability to receive over-the-air updates  for new features and upgrades. It also supports wireless connectivity for Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration.\nThe  Corolla will also come equipped with Toyota Safety Sense 3.0, the latest driver  assistance software suite from the automaker. This is a step forward from the 2022  model, which features the previous generation of the suite. Feature sets are  similar, but Toyota says the system is better at detecting hazards.\nAdditionally,  the popular LE trim level  now serves as the entry point to the lineup and adds a more powerful standard  engine for 2023. With the arrival of the GR Corolla, Toyota has also  discontinued the Apex Edition versions this year. Fans of manual transmissions  will no longer be able to get one with the Corolla SE trim level either. \nOtherwise,  the 2023 Corolla sedan continues as a solid pick  for a small sedan. In addition to its appealing, easy-to-drive nature, the  Corolla excels in the areas of reliability, efficiency and practicality. But  there are also some more highly rated sedans that are worth considering, such  as the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Mazda 3.  Toyota  hasn't released complete information on the 2023 Corolla as of this writing.  We'll update our recommendation if anything changes, but the LE trim looks to be the sweet spot in  the lineup. It offers a more powerful engine for 2023 and comes with the new  infotainment system and safety features, making it a good value in a compact  car.",

    "full_description": "Up  until this year, the Sequoia was one of the oldest vehicle designs on sale,  having lived through three presidential administrations and countless world  events since its introduction in 2008. But Toyota finally brought its three-row  SUV into the modern age with the 2023 Toyota Sequoia, a modern design using the  same body-on-frame architecture that underpins the Tundra pickup. \nFor  its third generation, the Sequoia gets new looks, an independent front  suspension, a new turbocharged V6 hybrid powertrain, increased towing  capability and an updated collection of advanced driver assist features. So  far, we like what Toyota has done with the once neglected big SUV. The new  powertrain has gobs of easily accessible power. Plant your foot at any speed,  and the transmission wastes no time to kick down a few gears and rocket the SUV  forward. Acceleration from a standstill is especially impressive for such a  large vehicle, and the sound emitted by the exhaust is so throaty you'd be  hard-pressed to identify it as anything but a burly V8.\nCompared  to the outgoing Sequoia, the new version's interior is much improved. The  centerpiece of the dashboard is a newly available 14-inch touchscreen, which  definitely adds to the new Sequoia's high-tech cabin design. Wireless connectivity  for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto comes standard on all models, meaning you  don't need to use a USB cable to integrate your phone's apps into the  touchscreen. The first two rows are plenty spacious, but the third row suffers  from tight headroom and an awkward seating position due to the high floor. \nThe  Sequoia competes with other big three-row SUVs like the Chevrolet Tahoe, Ford  Expedition and Jeep Wagoneer. It has a higher starting price, but it also has  more power, gets better fuel economy, and comes with a number of advanced  driving aids that cost extra on its rivals. It may have taken 14 years to get  here, but the new Sequoia appears to have been worth the wait.  One  upside of being more expensive than the competition is the Sequoia is well  equipped even in base form. The entry-level SR5 model comes with an impressive complement of useful features,  including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 360-degree camera and a  host of advanced driver aids. Opting for the SR5 Premium package adds a touch of luxury with synthetic leather  upholstery, power third-row seats and the larger 14-inch infotainment screen.",

Toyota says that many of the included systems, such as  forward collision warning and lane keeping assistance, have been improved to  provide better detection and functionality.\nOverall,  we think the updated Corolla Hatchback is a solid pick. But you might want to  also check out the Honda Civic hatchback and Mazda 3 hatchback. The Civic is  roomier on the inside than the Corolla, and the Mazda 3 is more upscale and  offers available all-wheel drive and turbocharged power.  While  we don't always recommend a vehicle's top trim, we think the XSE trim is the best of the Corolla  Hatchback's two available trims. The base model is a bit thin on creature  comforts compared to the XSE, so we think the step up in price is worth  it.",

    "full_description": "People  looking for alternatives to gas-powered cars are limited to a few options.  Hybrids use gasoline but reduce consumption by having an electric motor take  over at low speeds. Plug-in hybrids do the same, but let you recharge the  electric motor's battery for increased electric operation. And fully electric  cars, of course, run solely on electricity stored in battery cells.  \nThere's  another alternative: hydrogen. A hydrogen-powered car stores the gas inside  high-pressure tanks and uses it to generate power for an onboard electric  motor. No gasoline, no plugging into a wall outlet or charger. And the only  emission coming out of the tailpipe is water. \nThe  2023 Toyota Mirai is one of only two publicly available hydrogen-powered cars  and even as a regular midsize sedan, it's fairly impressive. But the Mirai  represents a commitment even more than it does a car. The asking price is  substantial, and hydrogen fueling stations are few and far between. Toyota also  limits new sales of the Mirai to California and Oahu, Hawaii. The cost of  hydrogen itself is something to be aware of, but you won't have to worry about  it for a while. Toyota includes a hydrogen \"gas card\" with the  purchase or lease of a Mirai good for $15,000 or six years, whichever comes  first. \nOverall,  we like the Mirai. It sports a luxuriously smooth ride,  pleasantly trimmed cabin and solid build quality. It's also surprisingly  composed to drive through corners thanks to its rear-wheel-drive architecture  and excellent weight balance. But passenger and cargo space is limited, and  you'll have to factor in whether the lifestyle of a hydrogen-fueled car is  really for you.  Toyota  hasn't released official information on the 2023 Mirai as of this writing.  We'll update our recommendation if anything changes, but based on last year's  Mirai, we suggest going with the Limited.  Given the limited number of fueling stations, the Mirai is as much a lifestyle  commitment as it is a car. Buyers willing to make the jump should get the best  possible version to maximize driving enjoyment.",

    "full_description": "Toyota  has been applying a \"Prime\" moniker to its Toyota Prius for a few  years now. That plug-in hybrid (PHEV) version of the Prius has a slightly  higher price and a somewhat bigger battery that enables 25 miles of electric  driving before the engine comes to life. It's sensible \u2014 if you can  plug it in and recharge it nightly \u2014 but that's about all. The 2021  Toyota RAV4 Prime shares that nondescript suffix, and perhaps unfortunately so.  This is a much more interesting and more compelling plug-in hybrid than the  Prius Prime. \nThe  reason why boils down to two points. The RAV4 Prime's battery is significantly  bigger, and that gives this small SUV an estimated all-electric range of 42  miles. That's a truly useful number that will cover most daily commutes  \u2014 especially when you know you can safely run it to zero and let the  gasoline engine seamlessly keep the party moving. On top of that, the RAV4  Prime has bigger electric motors that make it significantly quicker than any  other RAV4. Or just about any other small SUV for that matter.\nEven  with 302 horsepower, the RAV4 Prime isn't particularly fun to drive. But it is  a compelling plug-in hybrid that delivers exceptional economy and practicality. Consider  sticking with the SE to maximize the  RAV4's affordability. The XSE has more standard features \u2014 and offers  optional features you can't get on the SE \u2014 but none of them are  must-haves. You get the same fuel economy and performance with either trim  level. How does the RAV4 Prime drive? The RAV4 Prime gets up to speed much better than its standard or hybrid siblings. In Edmunds testing it reached 60 mph in an impressively quick 5.6 seconds. The regular RAV4, for example, needs a comparatively unhurried 9.1 seconds. The RAV4 Prime is also smooth and easy to drive under typical commuting conditions. \n\n   Unfortunately, Toyota has failed to back up the muscular powertrain with any sort of dynamic athleticism. Handling is pretty abysmal, with prevalent body roll and vague steering that makes it hard to judge the right amount of input. The electronic driver assistants also freak out at the smallest provocation. Another demerit comes from the brakes. The RAV4 Prime's pedal feel is overly soft. Panic-stopping performance in our testing was below average for a small SUV. How comfortable is the RAV4 Prime? The driver's seat has enough adjustments to allow you to easily find a comfortable seating position. But the front passenger seat has fewer adjustments, which might lead to a few complaints on long trips. The available simulated leather upholstery (Toyota's SofTex) breathes well and is definitely helped on hot days by the available seat ventilation. The rear seats are also praiseworthy for the better-than-average thigh support. \n\n   The RAV4 Prime's ride quality is biased more toward comfort than performance, delivering a smooth ride over road imperfections. Road and wind noise is abated to pleasant levels, though the gasoline engine sounds unrefined when you're aggressively accelerating. Otherwise, it's pleasantly muted. How\u2019s the interior? The RAV4 Prime gets strong scores here. The controls are well labeled and logically grouped for easy operation. The drive modes don't explain what they fully do (you'll definitely need to read the manual), but every other system is very intuitive. Entry and exit are helped by an ideal ride height and big door openings; shorter passengers can get in easily and taller people won't have to stoop to get in. \n\n   There is enough headroom and legroom for 6-footers in any seat. Forward visibility is praiseworthy thanks to narrow front windshield pillars, but the side view is obscured by the thick pillar between the front and rear doors. One other gripe is that the touchscreen is too far away from the driver. How\u2019s the tech? The available 9-inch screen makes most infotainment interactions quick, easy and distraction-free. It's quick to react, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard. The size and placement of physical shortcut buttons could be improved for less distraction. The JBL audio upgrade will get you stronger bass and clarity, but it's not all that impressive. \n\n   Toyota's advanced safety features generally function as they should. We're especially fond of the traffic-adaptive cruise control that proves its worth whether you're on a free-flowing highway or stuck in traffic. But the lane-keeping assist feature tends to add too much steering effort for anything but straight highway cruising. How\u2019s the storage? The RAV4 Prime takes a small hit when it comes to cargo capacity, accommodating 33.5 cubic feet as opposed to the standard RAV4's 37.6 cubic feet. Still, there's plenty of space for all your luggage, and you can fold the rear seats down with minimal effort. Interior storage is helped by some extra shelves cut into the dash, a wireless charging pad, and a good-size center armrest bin. \n\n   Parents with young kids will appreciate the RAV4. It's easy to locate and connect safety seats to the lower car seat anchors. Likewise, tethering to the three upper anchors is straightforward. Forward-facing seats and boosters fit readily, but installing a rear-facing infant seat on the passenger side will likely require scooting the front seat up. The too-high front passenger seat is the issue. How\u2019s the fuel economy? On our standardized evaluation route, the RAV4 Prime easily logged 48 miles of electric-only propulsion (6 miles better than the EPA estimate). That's enough to cover most people's average commute and daily driving. Once the gas engine kicked in, we averaged about 34 mpg, which is similar to the RAV4 Hybrid. You can also likely drive nearly 600 miles with a full tank of gas and fully charged battery. Is the RAV4 Prime a good value? The RAV4 Prime is quite a bit more expensive than the regular RAV4. It will take a while to recoup the cost of a Prime compared to buying a regular RAV4 Hybrid based on gas savings alone. \n\n   The Prime's build quality is good enough to justify the price, and some nice touches are exclusive to this plug-in hybrid model. The warranty for hybrid components is extended past Toyota's usual coverage. Two years of free scheduled maintenance is also included. As disappointing as the RAV4 Prime may be when it comes to performance and driving entertainment, it's an admirable plug-in hybrid SUV. Its easily achieved 42-mile EV range almost doubles that of its closest rivals (Kia Niro and Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV). It certainly doesn't hurt that it gets up to highway speeds quickly, and the sharp styling might attract shoppers away from the less traditional competition.",

    "full_description": "The 2016 4Runner gets cell phone navigation integration with its upgraded base audio system, and a slight increase in towing capacity for most models; otherwise, it's a carryover from 2015. The 2016 Toyota 4Runner is a rugged body-on-frame SUV with more off-road capability than almost any rival, but as a daily driver it's lacking a bit of refinement. Rowdy, off-road ready, truck-based SUVs were once the  hottest segment in the market. But shoppers soon discovered that bouncy rides  and poor fuel economy were also part of the deal. That ushered in the  crossover, an easy-riding, car-based light utility vehicle that looks a lot  like an SUV but lacks its truck-based ruggedness. There are only a few traditional  SUVs left these days, and the 2016 Toyota 4Runner stands proudly among them.  Boasting available three-row seating, a spacious cargo hold and Toyota's reputation for reliability, the  4Runner stays true to its roots as a hairy-chested SUV that's ready for almost  anything.\n\nThe 2016 Toyota 4Runner  is an unabashedly truck-based SUV with go-anywhere capability.\nEven in base SR5 trim, the Edmunds  \"B\" rated 4Runner is primed for off-road action. Standard  equipment includes items like mud guards and skid plates, while  four-wheel-drive models add a dual-range transfer case, hill-start assist and  hill-descent control. Move up the trim ladder and you can add better audio and advanced  electronic aids for more precise off-roading. Toyota has even beefed up towing  capacity for all models but the Limited trim. If off-roading and towing aren't  big on your list of things to do, though, there are better family SUVs  available. The 4Runner has a difficult time smoothing out potholes in the city  with its busy ride, and its fuel economy is woeful compared to most V6-powered  crossovers. And its optional third row seating is best reserved for kids, so if  you want adult-sized space back there, you'll need to look elsewhere.\nIf you don't need a third row of seating, the Jeep Grand  Cherokee is one of our favorites, offering competitive off-road  performance, several engine options, more robust towing capacity, better fuel  economy and an upscale interior. The related Dodge Durango also has more towing capacity and a premium cabin, comes standard with a  third-row seat and also has earned an Edmunds \"B'  rating. If you can do without all the trail-busting hardware, the \"A\"  rated Toyota  Highlander offers room for eight passengers, a carlike ride and superior  efficiency and acceleration.\nBut if nothing less than a rugged three-row midsize SUV will  do, the 2016 Toyota 4Runner is the only game in town. It may be among the last  of a dying breed, but it still has a lot to offer. The 2015 Toyota 4Runner employs a 4.0-liter V6 engine that  produces 270 horsepower and 278 pound-feet of torque. The transmission is a  five-speed automatic. The SR5 and Limited models are available with either  rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, while the Trail and TRD Pro are 4WD-only.\nFour-wheel-drive SR5 models have a part-time 4WD system with  low-range gearing, while the Limited uses a full-time 4WD system with low-range  gearing and a locking center differential. The Trail and TRD Pro models come  standard with the part-time 4WD system and also include a locking rear  differential, crawl control (for use in low range) and selectable terrain modes.  Properly equipped, the 4Runner SR5 RWD or 4WD and the Limited RWD model are rated  to tow up to 5,000 pounds; the Trail and TRD Pro models tow up to 4,900 pounds  and the 4WD Limited model tows up to 4,700 pounds. \nIn Edmunds testing, a 4WD 4Runner Trail went from zero to 60  mph in 7.8 seconds, which is about average among competing SUVs.\nThe EPA  estimates fuel economy at 19 mpg  combined (17 city/22 highway) for RWD models and 18 mpg  combined (17 city/21 highway) for all 4WD 4Runners. Those numbers are typical  for a traditional SUV, but well behind those of most V6-powered crossovers.  Standard safety features on the 2016 Toyota 4Runner include  antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front seat side airbags,  full-length side curtain airbags, front knee airbags and active front head  restraints. All 4WD models feature an off-road traction control system known as  A-Trac that helps keep you moving on slippery terrain by redirecting engine  torque to the wheel(s) that have traction.\nA rearview camera is standard across the board, but front  and rear parking sensors are available only on the Limited trim level. The  Limited also comes with Safety Connect, which includes automatic collision  notification, a stolen-vehicle locator and emergency assistance.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, a four-wheel-drive 4Runner Trail  model took 132 feet to stop from 60 mph, which is a long distance by crossover  standards but not bad for an off-road-oriented SUV.\nIn government crash tests, the 4Runner earned four out of a  possible five stars overall, including four stars for total frontal-impact  safety and five stars for total side-impact safety. The Insurance Institute for  Highway Safety awarded the 4Runner its top rating of \"Good\" in the  moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and roof-strength crash tests, but  the small-overlap frontal-offset crash test resulted in a \"Marginal\"  rating (second-lowest). The 4Runner's seat/head restraint design was rated \"Good\"  for whiplash protection in rear-impact crashes.  The Toyota 4Runner is designed to provide real utility when  the pavement ends. It's at its best when you're plugging along on off-road  trails, and the numerous upgrades on the Trail and TRD Pro trims only add to  the fun. At the same time, the 4Runner is refined enough for the daily grind,  though lots of bumps make it into the cabin as the rugged suspension and big  tires jostle you around. The 4Runner's steering feels a little too light in  normal driving situations, but is ideal for off-roading, as it results in  reduced wrist-wrecking kickback on gnarly trails.\n\nIf you want the ability  to keep on driving when you run out of road, the 2016 4Runner is a great  choice.\nThe 4Runner's V6 engine is strong enough for most needs, but  there's no denying that you get more grunt from rivals like the V8-powered Grand  Cherokee and Durango. The 4Runner's five-speed automatic transmission provides  well-timed shifts, but we certainly wouldn't mind another gear to calm the  engine on the highway and eke out another mpg or two. The interior of the 2016 Toyota 4Runner features instrumentation  and controls that are well laid out and easy to understand. Most owners will be  satisfied with the quality of the 4Runner's cabin materials, which are oriented  more toward durability than aesthetics. If you demand something a bit more  plush, an alternative such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee will likely be a better  fit.\nAll 4Runners come with a touchscreen audio interface placed  high on the center stack. Depending on which trim level you've selected, the  touchscreen brings various degrees of functionality from Toyota's Entune suite of smartphone-enabled  services and apps. All trims except the base SR5 and Trail include a navigation  system. The SR5 and Trail models' audio systems enable integration of  navigation from your smartphone. \n\nCargo capacity is  abundant in the 2016 4Runner, especially for a midsize SUV.\nAs for passenger accommodations, the 2016 4Runner's standard  five-person seating arrangement includes a reclining 40/20/40-split folding  second-row seat. The  optional third-row seat is bound to be a tempting option for carpoolers, but  you'll want to make sure your elementary schoolers will actually fit, as this  is one of the smallest, tightest third rows of any midsize SUV.\nIn reality, the real estate in the back of the 4Runner is  better suited for cargo. There's a healthy 47 cubic feet of cargo room behind  the second-row seats, a number that jumps to an even more impressive 89.7 cubic  feet with all the rear seats folded down. This is far more space than the Grand  Cherokee offers, and more than many large crossovers (such as the Ford Explorer  and Honda Pilot) as well. \nThe SR5 comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, skid  plates, mud guards, a tow hitch, hill-start assist and hill-descent control  (4WD only), a rearview camera, foglights, heated exterior mirrors, rear privacy  glass, LED taillights, roof rails, a power liftgate window, a windshield wiper  de-icer, keyless entry, cruise control, air-conditioning with second-row vents,  cloth upholstery, a six-way power driver seat with power lumbar adjustment, a  leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and 40/20/40-split folding  and reclining rear seats. Standard electronics features include Bluetooth phone  and audio connectivity, Scout GPS  Link cell phone navigation integration, and an eight-speaker audio system  with a 6.1-inch touchscreen interface, voice controls, a CD player, HD and  satellite radio, an auxiliary audio jack and an iPod/USB audio interface. \n\nThe 2016 4Runner's  dashboard continues the blocky, truck-inspired theme.\nThe SR5 Premium adds a sunroof, upgraded exterior mirrors, leatherette  (premium vinyl) upholstery, heated front seats, a power front passenger seat,  an auto-dimming rearview mirror and an upgraded version of Entune with smartphone  app integration and a navigation system.\nGo with the 4WD-only Trail trim and you'll get all of the  base SR5's standard features plus unique 17-inch wheels, a hood scoop, silver  exterior trim accents, a locking rear differential, selectable terrain modes  and crawl control. The Trail Premium model adds the SR5 Premium's standard  features.\nThe 4Runner Trail models are exclusively eligible for the  optional Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS), which automatically  disconnects the SUV's stabilizer bars in low-speed off-road situations to  improve suspension articulation over deep ruts and boulders.\nThe TRD Pro comes with most of the Trail Premium's standard  equipment, adding or substituting matte-black 17-inch wheels with special  off-road tires, automatic headlights, a TRD-stamped aluminum front skid plate, Bilstein shocks, upgraded front springs, a  higher ride height, a unique black front grille and various TRD-themed  aesthetic upgrades.\nThe 4Runner Limited includes most of the Trail Premium's feature  content, but it lacks the mud guards, locking rear differential, terrain-mode  selector and crawl control. Its available full-time 4WD system instead employs  a locking center differential. Other Limited highlights include 20-inch alloy  wheels, adaptive roll-reducing dampers (X-REAS),  automatic headlights, front and rear parking sensors, keyless entry and  ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, ventilated  front seats and a 15-speaker JBL sound system and Toyota's Safety Connect  telematics.\nMany of the higher-end standard amenities are available as  options on lower trim levels, but availability can vary depending on the region  of the United States in which you live. Stand-alone options include fixed  running boards, automatically deploying/retracting running boards, a sliding  rear cargo floor (two-row models only) and roof-rack crossbars.",

    "full_description": "For 2009, all Toyota Tacoma pickups get standard stability and traction control, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags, active front head restraints and a limited-slip differential. The standard audio system has also been upgraded, while Access Cab models get a new rear-seat design and standard power windows and door locks. With rising gas prices gluing full-size trucks to dealer lots, folks who still need a pickup's utility should find that the midsize and more fuel-efficient 2009 Toyota Tacoma is an ideal alternative. People need trucks. Of the millions that roam America's roads, though, there are a great many driven by folks who don't come close to utilizing their pickups' full potential -- particularly the full-size examples. Until recently, lower gas prices have made such an overkill automotive purchase acceptable -- but today, full-sizers are clogging dealer lots worse than a lifetime of bacon triple cheeseburgers clog your arteries. Luckily for those who truly need a pickup, there are midsize alternatives to the jumbo full-sizers. Among them, the 2009 Toyota Tacoma is your best bet.Adding to the Tacoma's practicality is a wide variety of combinations based on different cab styles, bed lengths, engines and trim levels. From the bare-bones work truck to the high-zoot Double Cab SR-5 with a long bed, there should be a Tacoma that fits anyone's needs. Plus, with an impressive interior and high level of available equipment, including an increase in standard safety content for 2009, the Tacoma can be as friendly to a plumber and his crew as it is to a family of four.In the past, we basically dismissed the base four-cylinder engine, since the V6 was clearly better suited to the Tacoma's mass. With rising gas prices, however, the four-cylinder, with its output of 159 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque, certainly seems more attractive. If your Tacoma is going to be used as a work truck and not involved with any heavy towing, the four-cylinder's fuel savings is an important aspect to consider. It offers more power than all but one competitor's four-cylinder, while offering better fuel economy. In total, the Tacoma is also a better-rounded candidate than those competitors, which include the Chevy Colorado, Dodge Dakota and Nissan Frontier. The 2009 Toyota Tacoma Regular and Access Cabs come standard with a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 159 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque. Rear-wheel-drive models come with the choice of a five-speed manual or a four-speed auto. Four-wheel-drive models only get the manual. Fuel economy for a rear-drive four-cylinder Tacoma with the auto is 19 mpg city/25 mpg highway and 21 mpg combined. Getting a manual improves that number slightly, while getting 4WD hurts it more.The 4.0-liter V6 standard on the Double Cab and optional on the Access Cab produces 236 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. The Double Cab is 4x4 only. With the exception of the PreRunner Double Cabs, a five-speed manual transmission is standard, with a five-speed automatic optional. A Tacoma Double Cab V6 we tested sprinted to 60 mph in just 7.8 seconds, making it one of the quickest midsize trucks available. Fuel economy for the 4x4 Double Cab with the auto is 16 mpg city/20 mpg highway and 18 mpg combined. Opting for the manual or the 4x2 Access Cab helps mileage. When properly equipped, the Tacoma can tow 6,500 pounds. All Tacoma pickups for 2009 come with stability and traction control, antilock brakes (disc front, drum rear) with brake assist, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and front active headrests. Hill-start assist control (HAC) and downhill assist control (DAC) are provided for 4WD models equipped with an automatic transmission.In government crash testing, the Tacoma received a top five-star rating for its protection of occupants in frontal and side-impact crashes. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Tacoma its top rating of \"Good\" in its frontal-offset crash test. The Tacoma is also the only compact/midsize truck to receive the highest rating of \"Good\" in the IIHS side-impact test. In this time of rising gas prices, the four-cylinder engine we once dismissed as simply \"adequate\" doesn't look that bad anymore. Its acceleration won't blow you away, and don't count on towing anything, but for a work truck, it makes sense. However, the V6 is a strong all-around performer, with plenty of pull down low and a willingness (albeit a somewhat noisy one) to spin into the upper rev ranges. Plus, towing heavy loads poses no problem for this powertrain. In terms of handling, the 2009 Toyota Tacoma feels like a true truck from behind the wheel. It excels in off-road situations and is reasonably comfortable on the street. But depending on how it's equipped and whether it's carrying a load or not, the Tacoma's ride can seem skittish and bouncy at times. The Tacoma is restrained in design, yet still offers high levels of quality and practicality. Fully loaded models include metallic trim and are quite classy -- especially compared to industrial rivals like the Dodge Dakota. The gauges and controls are straightforward and easy to use. The Double Cab's rear seat is comfortable for adults and storage space is plentiful. (There's a new rear-seat storage system standard on the Access Cab.) However, some drivers might take issue with the positioning of the driver seat, feeling that it's mounted too low to the floor. For hauling cargo, a non-rusting and dent-resistant composite cargo bed comes standard on all models, while an optional bed-mounted 115-volt/400-watt electrical outlet is ideal for campers and outdoor sports enthusiasts. Tacoma Regular Cabs are meant primarily for workhorse duty and are sparsely equipped. Standard features include 15-inch steel wheels, a limited-slip differential, a composite bedliner, a bed utility-rail system, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a front bench seat and a four-speaker stereo with a CD player and an auxiliary audio jack. The Tacoma Access Cab gains air-conditioning, power locks and windows, a rear bench with underseat storage and six speakers. The Tacoma Double Cab adds keyless entry, upgraded cloth upholstery and driver lumbar adjustment.Most options are grouped into packages available throughout the cab lineup. The SR-5 Package bundles exterior enhancements with interior upgrades (fancier seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise control). The TRD Off-Road Package includes 16-inch alloy wheels, fender flares, exterior chrome trim, a heavy-duty suspension, a locking rear differential, skid plates and sport seats. The TRD Sport Package includes 17-inch alloy wheels, a hood scoop, a sport suspension and sport seats. Separate options available include alloy wheels, cruise control, a towing package, rear park assist and an upgraded stereo with six-CD changer, satellite radio and Bluetooth (Double Cab only).All body styles are available in both two- and four-wheel drive. A PreRunner version available in all body styles gets the rugged look and suspension of a 4WD truck without the added weight, fuel appetite and traction of actual 4WD. The rear-drive-only X-Runner version is more performance-oriented, with a body kit, 18-inch alloy wheels, a low ride height, a hood scoop, foglamps and an upgraded stereo.",

A touchscreen-based audio system and Toyota's Entune suite of smartphone-connected apps are standard for all trim levels, as is a rearview camera. There are also minor changes in standard equipment. For the relatively few drivers who require an all-conquering all-terrain SUV, the 2014 Toyota 4Runner is a top choice. If  your lifestyle necessitates a vehicle with genuine off-road capability (or  heck, you just prefer your daily ride to be ready for anything), Toyota's got  you covered with the 2014 4Runner. It's one of the few remaining midsize SUVs  on the market that embodies the term \"sport-utility vehicle\" to the  fullest extent as opposed to just looking the part.\nYou  can still bang around off-road with the 2014 Toyota 4Runner because it employs  the same rugged body-on-frame architecture that underpins pickup trucks. And  that, along with plenty of suspension travel and protective underbody plates,  helps keep things from breaking when used as intended. The 4Runner's  four-wheel-drive system also has low-range gearing and an available locking  rear differential to help see you through rough terrain, deep snow or whatever  else you want to throw its way.\nOf  course, there are plenty of consumers who enjoy the Toyota 4Runner's  traditionalist image, but mainly use it for commuting to work and running  errands with the kids. In a nod to that reality, Toyota has made some changes to the  4Runner this year. The SR5 and Trail models feature upgraded interior materials  and all models get a new instrument panel and a touchscreen audio interface  with smartphone integration via the automaker's Entune system (although we've  found Entune to be a mixed bag when it's actually time to use it). A rearview  camera -- an invaluable safety feature on any SUV -- is standard across the  board for 2014, while Limited models now allow you to bask in the comforts of  heated and ventilated front seats. And although the optional third-row seat is  not very roomy, the 4Runner continues to offer it, providing seven-passenger  capacity in a pinch.\nThat  third-row seat, along with high cargo capacity, is one of the 2014 4Runner's  few advantages over its closest rival, the Jeep Grand Cherokee,  which seats only five. Otherwise, though, we think the Jeep offers a better  compromise between off-road capability and on-road comfort. Plus, it's  available with a fuel-efficient diesel engine (not to mention a couple of V8s)  -- whereas the Toyota is V6 only -- and comes with a great deal more high-end  tech and safety features.\nMeanwhile,  buyers wanting a true SUV with a third row they can use every day will likely  find the somewhat larger Dodge Durango more spacious and  comfortable. For those who can spend a bit more, the Volkswagen Touareg  offers premium interior accommodations, along with a strong lineup of engines  (including a diesel) and a high tow rating for a midsize SUV. And if you don't  require much off-pavement ability at all, there are numerous car-based  crossover SUVs like the 2014 Chevrolet Traverse and the 2014 Toyota Highlander that  will meet your needs. They'll also provide a softer, more carlike ride, lower  step-in height and better fuel economy. \nAll  that said, the choices for a modestly sized and (relatively) modestly priced  genuine SUV seem to be narrowing every year, and the 2014 Toyota 4Runner  remains a likable option in this cadre. The  2014 Toyota 4Runner comes standard with a 4.0-liter V6 engine that produces 270  horsepower and 278 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed automatic transmission is  also standard. The SR5 and Limited models are available with either rear-wheel  drive or four-wheel drive, while the Trail is 4WD only. \nFour-wheel-drive  SR5 models have a part-time four-wheel-drive system with a low-range transfer  case, while the Limited uses a full-time 4WD system with low-range gearing and  an independently lockable center differential. The Trail model comes standard  with the part-time 4WD system and also includes a locking rear differential,  crawl control (for use in low range) and selectable electronic  terrain-sensitive systems. Properly equipped, the 4Runner is rated to tow up to  4,700 pounds.\nIn  Edmunds testing, a rear-drive 4Runner SR5 accelerated from a standstill to 60  mph in 7.2 seconds (7.8 seconds for a four-wheel-drive Trail model), which is  about average among competing SUVs. The EPA estimates fuel economy at 19 mpg  combined (17 mpg city/22 mpg highway) for rear-wheel-drive models and 18 mpg  combined (17 mpg city/21 mpg highway) for four-wheel-drive 4Runners  (regardless of which 4WD your vehicle has) -- slightly below average for a  midsize, off-road-oriented SUV with a gas-powered six-cylinder engine. Standard  safety features on the 2014 Toyota 4Runner include antilock disc brakes,  stability and traction control, front seat side airbags, full-length side  curtain airbags, front knee airbags and active front head restraints. All 4WD  models feature an off-road traction control system known as A-TRAC that helps  keep you moving on slippery terrain by redirecting engine torque to the  wheel(s) that have traction. A rearview camera is standard across the board.  The Limited comes with the Safety  Connect emergency communications system, which includes automatic collision  notification, a stolen-vehicle locator and roadside assistance.\nIn  Edmunds brake testing, a rear-wheel-drive 4Runner SR5 came to a stop from 60  mph in 122 feet, which is average among SUVs in its class. A Trail model with  its off-road-oriented tires needed a longer 132 feet to come to a standstill.\nIn  government crash tests, the 4Runner earned an overall rating  of four stars (out of a possible five) along with four stars in frontal  crash protection and five stars in side-impact protection. The Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety awarded the 4Runner its top rating  of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and  roof-strength crash tests. Its seat/head restraint design also rates  \"Good\" for whiplash protection in rear-impact crashes.  Unlike  most of today's midsize SUVs, the 2014 Toyota 4Runner is designed to provide  real utility when the pavement ends. This Toyota is at its best when you're  plugging along on off-road trails -- the Trail with optional KDSS is the  version you'll want for these adventures. At the same time, the 4Runner has  enough refinement that you can simply drive it to work every day, if that's  your preference. This is still a SUV in the traditional mold, however, and  compared to modern crossover SUVs you'll feel a lot more of the bumps and ruts  in the road. Toyota's steering feels a little too light and overboosted in normal  driving situations, but this calibration turns out to be ideal for off-roading,  as it results in reduced kickback on gnarly trails.\nThe  Toyota 4Runner's smooth V6 engine is strong enough that only consumers planning  to tow a trailer will lament the lack of a V8 option.\u00a0Still, there's  no denying that you'd get more pulling power and better fuel economy with the  optional diesel engines on rivals like the Grand Cherokee and Touareg. The  4Runner's five-speed automatic transmission provides well-timed shifts, but we  certainly wouldn't mind another gear to calm the engine on the highway and eke  out another mpg or two.  One  of the changes you'll notice immediately in the 2014 Toyota 4Runner interior is  the new instrument panel. In place of the old individual gauge binnacles, the  new design locates an oversized speedometer and tachometer on either side of a  multifunction screen trip computer. The new gauges are attractive and easy to read,  and a welcome upgrade over the previous design.\nIn  addition, all 2014 4Runners come with a touchscreen audio interface placed high  on the center stack. Depending on which trim level you've selected, it brings  various degrees of functionality from Toyota's Entune suite of  smartphone-enabled services and apps (among them, Pandora Internet radio, the Bing search engine and sports/stock info  updates). The SR5/Trail Premium models and the Limited integrate a navigation  system into this interface. Getting started with  Entune can be a hassle, though, since you have to install an app on your phone  and register for an account; plus, you always need an active data connection to  use it. The touchscreen interface has straightforward menus, but it's sometimes  unresponsive to touch.\nMost  owners will be satisfied with the quality of the 4Runner's cabin materials,  which are oriented more toward durability than aesthetics. Although you won't  be afraid to get the Toyota's interior dirty, there's no denying that it has a  more workaday ambience than, say, the interior of the Jeep Grand Cherokee.\nAs  for passenger accommodations, the standard five-person seating arrangement  includes a reclining 40/20/40-split-folding second-row seat.\u00a0The  optional third-row seat is bound to be a tempting option for carpoolers (as it  provides seating for seven), but you'll want to make sure your elementary  schoolers will actually fit, as this is one of the smallest, tightest third  rows of any midsize SUV.\nMost  buyers will find that this space is better used for cargo. There's a healthy 47  cubic feet of cargo room behind the second-row seats, a number that jumps to an  even healthier 89.7 cubic feet with all the rear seats folded down. This is far  more space than the Grand Cherokee offers and more than many large crossovers  (such as the Ford Explorer and Honda Pilot) as well. \nThe  SR5 comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, skid plates, a tow hitch, hill  start assist and hill descent control, a rearview camera, foglights, heated  exterior mirrors, rear privacy glass, a power-lowering liftgate window, a  windshield wiper de-icer, keyless entry, cruise control, air-conditioning with  second-row vents, cloth upholstery, a six-way power driver seat, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel with tilt/telescope adjustment, and  40/20/40-split-folding and reclining rear seats. On the electronics side, it  comes with Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity and an eight-speaker audio system with a  touchscreen interface, the Entune suite of smartphone-connected apps, a CD player, satellite radio, an auxiliary  audio jack and an iPod/USB audio interface.\nThe  SR5 Premium model adds a sunroof and outside mirrors with integrated turn  signals and puddle lamps. Inside, you get Toyota's SofTex premium vinyl  upholstery, heated front seats, a four-way power front passenger seat, a  navigation system and an upgraded version of Entune with voice control,  phonebook-download capability and text-to-speech messaging for enabled phones.\nThe  4Runner Trail model includes all of the base SR5's standard features and adds  off-road-oriented all-season tires, mudguards, body-color exterior trim,  special components and electronic aids for off-road capability and an eight-way  power driver seat. The Trail Premium model adds the sunroof and all of the  interior amenities and electronics you get on the SR5 Premium. Either 4Runner  Trail model can be equipped with the optional Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System  (KDSS). This option is aimed at serious outdoor enthusiasts, as KDSS  automatically disconnects the SUV's stabilizer bars in low-speed off-road  situations to improve suspension articulation over deep ruts and boulders.\nThe  2014 4Runner Limited includes all of the Trail Premium's standard content,  except for the off-road-related equipment. It also comes standard with 20-inch  alloy wheels, adaptive shock absorbers for the suspension, automatic  headlights, keyless ignition/entry, dual-zone automatic climate control,  perforated leather upholstery, heated front seats and ventilation for the  driver seat, and an upgraded JBL sound system with 15 speakers and HD radio.\nMany  of the features found on the 4Runner Trail and Limited models are available as  options on the lower trim levels, though specifics will vary based on the  region of the United States in which you live. Other options include fixed  running boards for the SR5 and Trail, automatically deploying/retracting  running boards for the Limited, a sliding rear cargo floor and roof-rack crossbars.",

    "full_description": "The 2003 Toyota Prius, a hybrid-electric vehicle, is unchanged. One of the most interesting pieces of automotive hardware currently sold, the 2003 Toyota Prius is worth a look if you're shopping for a hybrid vehicle. Due to increased pressure from governments, automakers have been looking for ways to meet increasingly stringent demands for cleaner tailpipe emissions and higher fuel mileage. In the '90s, electric cars like GM's EV1 were thought to be the answer, but they are limited by poor range and the fact that they have to be \"plugged in\" in order to be recharged. Hydrogen-fueled fuel cell cars will some day be the ultimate evolution of the automobile, as their exhaust by-product is essentially water vapor. But the technology for fuel cell cars is still young, and mass-produced fuel cell cars are a number of years away.For today and the near future, the best hope is hybrid-electric vehicles. Hybrid cars combine a gasoline engine with an electric motor. And since hybrids are still fueled by gasoline, they don't have to be plugged in or recharged. In the case of the Toyota Prius, the result of hybrid technology is reduced emissions and improved fuel efficiency when compared to a normal gasoline-powered car. The only fear has been that a hybrid vehicle would never be useful as a real car that real people would want to buy. With the Prius, Toyota has largely quieted those fears.While the Prius became available to the American consumer in 2001, Toyota has been selling them in Japan since December 1997. Compared to earlier Prius models, U.S. versions feature more horsepower, additional emissions equipment and a more powerful battery pack that is also smaller and lighter.There are only three mainstream hybrid-electric vehicles for sale in the United States. There's the Prius, the Honda Insight and the Honda Civic Hybrid. Up until this year, we felt the Prius was the best choice, as it was more versatile than the two-seat Insight. But the Civic Hybrid is all-new for 2003, and in many ways this \"second-generation\" hybrid vehicle is superior to the Prius. The Civic would be our choice for a hybrid vehicle, though the 2003 Toyota Prius is still worth considering. Compared to most modern passenger sedans, Prius is a few fries short of an automotive power Happy Meal. Its aluminum 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine makes 70 horsepower and 82 pound-feet of torque. The electric drive motor is worth another 44 peak horsepower; Toyota says the hybrid system's net horsepower rating is 98. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is standard. Zero-to-60 mph takes 12.8 seconds, about three seconds slower than a comparable gasoline car.But if all you are interested in is drag racing, big smoky burnouts and collecting John Force T-shirts, you're looking at the wrong car. What makes the Prius unique is that it is able to provide tolerable acceleration while also offering exceptional fuel mileage and squeaky-clean emissions. The EPA rates the Prius at 52 mpg in the city and 45 mpg on the highway, theoretically allowing over 600 miles between fill-ups. It also earns a Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (SULEV) rating, which means the Prius is considerably cleaner than vehicles with LEV or even ULEV ratings. The Prius comes standard with antilock brakes. Front side airbags, should you want them, are optional. In the NHTSA's frontal crash tests, the 2003 Toyota Prius earned three stars (out of possible five) for driver safety and four stars for passenger safety. At low speeds and during light throttle applications, the 2003 Toyota Prius relies completely on the electric motor for acceleration. This means that when the car is accelerating gently from a stop or driving around a parking lot, it might be doing it with 100 percent electrical power. The engine, meanwhile, is completely inert. In all other respects, the Prius pretty much drives like a regular car. Since it has a continuously variable transmission, there are no actual gears to select. The choices are simply park, reverse, neutral, drive or brake. Handling ability, as you might expect, is on the light side, but the Prius fairs well enough for its intended purpose. Accommodations are surprisingly good for a small car, with upright seating positions and good outward visibility. Two adults will fit in the backseat without too much complaint, and the trunk holds 11.8 cubic feet of cargo, a capacity that is similar to other small cars. The rear seat does not fold down, however. The 2003 Toyota Prius is available only as a four-door sedan with one trim level. With this, you get plenty of standard equipment, such as automatic climate control, air conditioning, power windows and locks, power steering, antilock brakes and keyless entry. The only factory options are cruise control, a DVD-based navigation system, side-impact airbags and daytime-running lights. A CD player isn't included, though you can get a six-disc CD changer as a dealer accessory.",

    "full_description": "The  large sedan class isn't what it used to be. Fewer automakers offer them because  consumers are increasingly gravitating to SUVs and highly capable midsize  sedans. Toyota, however, is one brand that's still carrying the torch. In fact,  it's doubled down. Redesigned just last year, the Toyota Avalon simultaneously  exemplifies and upends the conventions of the class. \nLike  past Avalons (and most large sedans), this latest model has a V6 engine that  delivers smooth acceleration. It also has a roomy interior. Though only  slightly larger than the Toyota Camry, the Avalon has acres of legroom for all  occupants and a higher percentage of premium materials. The Avalon lends itself  well to long road trips thanks to the supportive outboard seats and minimal  wind noise. \nToyota  also plays against type by bringing performance into the picture. The Avalon,  with nimble handling and quick steering, is surprisingly up to the challenge of  zipping along a curvy road. There's even a new TRD model this year with a  sport-tuned suspension. If you want an uncompromising blend of performance and  comfort, consider the top Touring trim. It's equipped with adaptive dampers  that soften the ride or sharpen handling at the press of a button \u2014 a  rare feature for this type of vehicle.\nDownsides?  Well, there's not a huge amount of headroom, which is odd for this class of  vehicle, and Android Auto smartphone integration is conspicuously missing from  the features list. But overall, we think highly of the 2020 Avalon. It's a  definite step up in terms of quality and comfort compared to the Camry, and  it's the most well-rounded pick compared to rivals such as the Chrysler 300 and  the Kia Cadenza.  The  base XLE is equipped generously, and  we think many buyers would be happy with its accommodations. But if you can  swing the higher monthly payment, we say go for the loaded-up Touring. You're  buying an Avalon because it's supposed to be a little nicer than  run-of-the-mill sedans such as the Camry and Honda Accord. How does the Avalon drive? With a potent 301-horsepower V6 mated to a smooth-shifting transmission, the Avalon has good power to get up and go. It is also pleasant to use in most scenarios, from long road trips and afternoon cruises to day-to-day commutes and short errands around town. Braking is consistent and never grabby, which lends to its comfort in daily use. \n\n   The Avalon is surprising in its athleticism \u2014 its shockingly enjoyable handling and drivability. While not a sport sedan, this cruiser can handle twisty roads with relative ease for a vehicle of its size. Think about a mobile defensive end or tackle in football as opposed to an athletic linebacker. How comfortable is the Avalon? Comfort is a strength for the Avalon and is probably the primary reason you'd consider such a large sedan. All seating positions give you ample cushioning and support for long drives or short cruises. The leather upholstery is very soft and gives the sensation that the Avalon is more upscale than its price suggests. \n\n   The ride is cushioned and makes you feel shielded from harsh roads. The cabin is also really cozy due to the climate control's quick heating and cooling. While there is no rattling or shaking inside the cabin, road noise is somewhat present at all times. How\u2019s the interior? The Avalon's cabin is a decent place to be. It is roomy and user-friendly. There are even redundant key functions located on the steering wheel. Legroom is abundant, the driving position is superb due to its multitude and depth of adjustments, and visibility is great up front and modest to the sides and over the shoulder. \n\n   As far as controls go, there are two minor issues: The radio tuning knob can be a reach for some, and a couple of functions, such as turning on the camera view, are tucked away. While legroom is a strength, headroom can feel a little compromised for taller people \u2014 especially in the rear due to the sloping roofline. Lastly, the low-resolution rearview camera and display could use an upgrade. How\u2019s the tech? Toyota's Entune system and its 9-inch touchscreen are surprisingly good. Apple CarPlay support makes things so much better, but Android Auto is still absent. The display is bright and responds well to inputs, but Toyota tends to lock out more functions while you're driving than other carmakers. \n\n   There's one USB port for data and four 2.1-amp power-only USBs \u2014 two up front and two in back. The front console also houses a wireless charging pad. The car's built-in voice controls are hit-or-miss \u2014 it's better at understanding radio commands than navigation commands. We had much more success using Siri via Apple CarPlay. How\u2019s the storage? While cargo capacity is average on paper, the Avalon works out to be more convenient compared to some others due to the wide trunk opening, broad floor and convenient loading height. You might be disappointed if you're the type who folds the rear seats to expand the space because there's a sizable step up to the folded seats.\n\n   Inside, there are numerous small cubbies, plenty of cupholders, and a center console that's sizable and surprisingly deep. The door pockets are average, but there are enough other options that it's not a concern. The Avalon really shines when it comes to fitting child safety seats. The car seat anchors are easy to access, and the huge rear bench has space enough for just about any type of seat. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Avalon is rated at 25 combined mpg (22 city/31 highway), which is excellent for this class of car. It's not outstanding like the hybrid variant, but it's still really good. During our mixed-driving 115-mile evaluation route, we were able to observe 26 mpg, which slightly beat the combined EPA score. Is the Avalon a good value? The Avalon offers a good deal of quality and refinement. It feels close enough to the Lexus ES in this regard that someone looking for a large sedan might want to consider the Avalon instead because it costs thousands less. Beyond the great deal, you also get high gas mileage, a good roadside assistance program, and free scheduled maintenance for the first two years. The Avalon is a low-key performer. The exterior, aside from the huge brace-face grille, is nondescript, while the interior delivers a composed, civil, and sophisticated style. None of this is bad, but it sets you up to be surprised by its hidden athleticism. In the context of a big family sedan, it's fun to drive due to its surprising handling capabilities and strong V6 engine.",

    "full_description": "The  midsize pickup truck market has been growing, but it's fair to say that the  Toyota Tacoma is still the odds-on favorite for a lot of shoppers. From its  basic work-truck configuration to luxury-oriented or off-road variants, the  Tacoma is simply one of the most well-rounded pickups on sale today.  Improvements for the 2020 model, combined with historically strong resale  prices, make this year's Tacoma a better value proposition than ever.   It  starts on the inside where it gets a larger touchscreen and a new infotainment  system that finally features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. These  additions make it a lot easier to avoid using Toyota's proprietary Entune  software, which isn't particularly intuitive. Other modifications include a  recalibrated automatic transmission \u2014 which helps reduce the sluggish  feel that plagued last year's Tacoma \u2014 and a power driver's seat that  offers greater adjustability for improved comfort. As  before, a relatively tall ride height may inhibit entry into the cabin, but it  also means every Tacoma is ready to head off the beaten path at a moment's  notice. The same is especially true of the two off-road trims that feature a  superior approach angle, beefy shock absorbers and a lockable center  differential to increase its adventuring potential. New downward-facing cameras  further help you avoid any frame-bending obstacles you may come across.  These  adjustments fix the most significant complaints we've had about past Tacomas.  The Tacoma has a slightly rougher ride than rivals such as the Chevrolet  Colorado and the Honda Ridgeline. And if you want the ultimate rock-crawling  pickup, the new Jeep Gladiator ekes out a slight edge. But the Toyota Tacoma  represents a nice balance between on- and off-road adventuring, and its solid  resale value only sweetens the pot.What's it like to live with the  Tacoma?When the Tacoma was redesigned in 2016, we wanted to know  what it was like to live with, so we bought one. Specifically, we purchased the  2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off Road and lived with it in our long-term fleet for  nearly two years, putting over 40,000 miles on the odometer. The Tacoma has  received some updates since its redesign in 2016, including additional standard  safety features and smartphone integration capability, but it's the same generation truck so most of our observations still apply. To learn more about  the Toyota Tacoma, check out all the details in our long-term test, where we cover everything from  seat comfort to real-world fuel economy. The TRD Off-Road model offers a nice blend  of comfort and off-road performance at an agreeable price. The V6 and 4x4  powertrain are standard, as are several performance upgrades. You might not  need the lockable rear differential on the road, and the removal of the airdam  comes with a slight fuel economy penalty. But the Bilstein shocks and smaller  wheels pay off in day-to-day driving as they soak up road imperfections and  make the ride more agreeable. How does the Tacoma drive? The Tacoma steers and handles smoothly and is generally easy to drive. The main exception is the brakes, which feel grabby and can induce nosedive in hard stops. We do wish the 3.5-liter V6 felt a bit more willing, but there is enough power for daily use. The transmission shifts predictably and is able to get the most out of the engine.  Off-road is where the Tacoma truly shines and stands above all others except the Gladiator. The Tacoma has the clearance, gearing and traction to tackle serious terrain, and the brakes and throttle prove to be brilliantly precise and controllable in low-range crawling situations. How comfortable is the Tacoma? The Tacoma was never a disagreeable truck to ride in, but changes introduced in 2020 have made it a little bit more pleasant. A fully adjustable 10-way driver's seat comes standard in V6 trucks, and this seat promotes long-range comfort for drivers of almost all shapes and sizes.   The thicker side-window glass cuts down the wind noise compared to prior years, though the Colorado and the Ridgeline still have an edge here. The same is true for ride quality since the Tacoma is still truckier than its smoothest-riding competitors. As for the climate system, it has effective heating and cooling and is easy to adjust. How\u2019s the interior? The Tacoma's main drawback is its tallish step-in height. Get past that and everything else is solid once you're inside. The controls are logical and straightforward, including the new enlarged infotainment screen and the redesigned knobs and physical shortcut buttons.   The new 10-way power seat provides a greater range of adjustability than before, but we still wish the telescoping steering wheel pulled out more. The front seat roominess benefits from the seat's added downward adjustability, but other dimensions remain the same as before. Visibility is very good thanks to the profile of the hood, ample side windows, and a new forward and side-looking camera system. How\u2019s the tech? The latest Tacoma is now pretty well stocked with tech features. The new screen boasts a larger size, crisper map graphics and quicker responses. You also get Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and even Amazon Alexa this year. Built-in navigation is an inexpensive upgrade option, and it's probably worth getting if you're planning on venturing out of cellphone range a lot.   Toyota's approach to standard active safety tech is admirable. Adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, automatic high-beam control, and even a driver drowsiness warning system are all standard on all grades. How are the towing and storage? The Tacoma's truck bed is ideal. It's made of a composite material that needs no bedliner, and it has an enviable combination of fixed and movable tie-downs. Loading is easy because the tailgate opens low and its bedsides aren't comically tall. The Tacoma's 6,800-pound maximum tow rating does lag behind some others, but the deficit isn't large.   Interior storage for small items is adequate. Folding the rear seats down into their cargo-carrying position is a little fussy, but the result is better storage space than all but the Ridgeline and the Gladiator. Installing child safety seats is easy, but larger rear-facing and infant seats may eat into front passenger room. How\u2019s the fuel economy? he 3.5-liter V6 engine and six-speed automatic combo earns 20 mpg combined (18 city/22 highway) in 4WD trim and 21 mpg combined in rear-wheel-drive models. Our testing leads us to believe that these ratings are achievable and accurate.   We tested a 2016 TRD 4WD Off-Road for more than a year and averaged 18.6 mpg over 40,000 miles of use. We were able to exceed the highway rating on several road trips, and there are good reasons why our truck may have come up just over 1 mpg short. Our home-base location skews the mix toward city driving, and the TRD Off-Road has knobbier tires and lacks the front airdam that comes on most Tacomas. Is the Tacoma a good value? You get a lot of well-built truck and a bed with many standard cargo handling and safety features for your money. The value equation is particularly good on the TRD models. Build quality is solid, and Toyota trucks are known for their mechanical durability. Although warranty coverage isn't generous, you do get two years of free scheduled maintenance. Toyota's Tacoma manages to deliver fun in a right-size pickup package. Its TRD off-road packages are the real deal, not sticker packages inflated by marketing hype. The buying public has responded with fierce loyalty, and this truck has also attracted the attention of the aftermarket, which supports it with many products that enable all sorts of customization. The Tacoma is great for those who want the look and feel of an off-roader even if they'll never get it dirty because it's also an easy-driving and dependable pickup truck.",

    "full_description": "The 2014 Toyota Venza receives minor equipment changes. The XLE trim gets power-folding mirrors, while the Limited gets front and rear parking sensors. Whether you call the five-passenger 2014 Toyota Venza a wagon or a crossover, it's a competitive and comfortable family vehicle. Not everyone needs three rows of seating in a family  crossover, or the big and SUV-like styling that comes along with it. Enter the 2014  Toyota Venza, a tall, midsize wagon aimed at consumers seeking a generous  helping of space and amenities in a five-passenger vehicle. Thanks to its lower  stance, it drives far more like a car than similarly priced midsize SUVs you  might consider -- and that, along with its reliable Toyota genes, is what makes it most  appealing.\nFrom the driver seat, the Venza feels like a wagon. Though  it has a taller ride height than the similarly sized Camry sedan, you don't sit  as high as you would in a traditional SUV. Instead, it's akin to sitting in a 2014 Subaru Outback, a perennial SUV  alternative and a key rival for the Venza. As you'd expect in a wagon of this  size, the rear seats offer plenty of room for a couple of adults or three kids,  and when they're folded down, you'll have an impressive 70 cubic feet of cargo  space at your disposal.\nOn the road, a composed ride and quiet cabin give the Toyota  Venza a decidedly grown-up feel. There's nothing sporty about Toyota's wagon,  but it's an easy vehicle to drive in the everyday grind. Toyota offers both a  four-cylinder and V6 engine. Your practical side might be inclined to go for  the four-cylinder, but in this case, the V6 is the smarter choice as it offers better  performance and nearly identical fuel economy.\nBecause of its wide-ranging appeal, the 2014 Toyota Venza  can be cross-shopped against quite a few different vehicles. The Outback is an  obvious choice, of course, especially since it tends to be less expensive while  offering a little more off-road capability for camping trips. Other  possibilities include crossover SUVs like the Ford  Edge, Kia  Sorento and Nissan Murano,  which have similar space and amenities, but sit a little higher off the ground.  Although the Venza doesn't have any significant advantages over these rivals, it's  a solid option for consumers who want more utility than a traditional midsize  sedan offers but aren't quite sold on the SUV lifestyle. The 2014 Toyota Venza has a choice of two available engines:  a four-cylinder or a V6. Both engines come with either front-wheel drive or  all-wheel drive. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard. The LE and XLE  trims have the four-cylinder engine as standard with the six-cylinder as an  option, while the Limited trim is exclusively equipped with the V6.\nThe 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine produces 181 horsepower  and 182 pound-feet of torque. In Edmunds performance testing, a four-cylinder,  front-drive Venza went from a standstill to 60 mph in 9.3 seconds, a typical  time for a midsize crossover with a four-cylinder engine, but about 2 seconds  slower than a V6 Venza. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 23 mpg  combined (20 mpg city/26 mpg highway). The all-wheel-drive version gets 22 mpg combined (20 mpg city/26 mpg highway). These numbers are on the low side when compared  with the Subaru Outback or any number of smaller crossovers like the Honda CR-V  and Toyota's own RAV4.\nA better choice for most buyers is the 3.5-liter V6 engine,  which is rated at 268 hp and 246 lb-ft of torque. In Edmunds performance  testing, a front-wheel-drive, V6-equipped Venza V6 accelerated from zero to 60  mph in 7.1 seconds, while an AWD Venza V6 did it in 6.9 seconds -- in both  cases, quick times for a six-cylinder midsize crossover. Fuel economy is almost  identical to that of the four-cylinder Venza, with an EPA-estimated 22 mpg  combined (19 mpg city/26 mpg highway) on front-drive versions and 21 mpg combined (18 mpg city/25 mpg highway) with AWD.\nWith the optional towing package, the Venza V6 can tow up to  3,500 pounds. Every 2014 Toyota Venza comes standard with antilock brakes,  traction and stability control, front side airbags, side curtain airbags and a  driver knee airbag. A rearview camera is optional on the LE and standard on the  XLE and Limited. Front and rear parking sensors are standard on the Limited  only.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the 2014 Venza XLE came to a stop  from 60 mph in 120 feet: shorter than the average distance for a midsize  crossover with all-season tires.\nIn government crash testing, the Venza received a rating  of five stars out of five for overall protection, with four stars for  overall frontal-impact protection and five stars for overall side-impact  protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Venza the best  possible rating  of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side and  roof-strength crash tests. The Venza also earned a \"Good\" Rating for  its head restraints/seatbelt performance regarding whiplash protection in rear  impacts. Like most other midsize crossovers, the 2014 Toyota Venza is  designed for comfort, utility and ease of driving. The base four-cylinder  engine delivers adequate power for most driving situations, but you'll notice  it when pushed to the limit, so we'd still recommend paying extra for the smoother  V6 engine. Not only does it provide quick acceleration, its fuel economy pretty  much equals the four-cylinder's mpg ratings.\nIf you're used to driving smaller, sportier cars, you might  find the Venza's steering short on feedback, but in general, this tall wagon grips  and handles exceptionally well considering its utilitarian purpose. More  relevant to most consumers is ride comfort, and the Venza has it in spades.  Even with the 20-inch wheels, its suspension does a fine job of smoothing out  pockmarked pavement. The interior design of the Toyota Venza is attractive and  practical, with a sleek center console that features a high-mounted shift lever  for the transmission that frees up space between the seats. This allows for a  large console bin, generously sized cupholders and smaller bins that are perfect  for smartphones and other personal effects.\nThe Venza's standard touchscreen audio interface is easy to  use. We appreciate its ability to mix and match FM/AM/XM radio presets, and the  accompanying steering-wheel-mounted controls are well designed. For those with  more high-tech tastes, the Venza also can be equipped with Toyota's Entune  system. By connecting the car to a smartphone via Bluetooth, it allows you to  control Pandora Internet radio, buy movie tickets or reserve a restaurant table  through the car's touchscreen. Getting started  with Entune can be a hassle, though, since you have to install an app on your  smartphone and register for an account, plus you always need an active data  connection through your cell phone to use it.\nTall doors and a low step-in height make the Venza one of  the easiest cars to get in and out of, even in tight spaces. For the  mobility-challenged, it is one of the better vehicles to consider. And like the  Outback and similarly sized midsize crossover SUVs, the Venza's backseat offers  plenty of legroom, and reclining seatback cushions increase comfort on long  trips. And there's enough shoulder- and hiproom to seat three children across  back here. The driver seat is less comfortable, however, and it could use more  padding, greater lateral support and a greater range of adjustability. The  cargo area can swallow 70 cubic feet of stuff with the rear seats folded and a  healthy 36.2 cubes with the seats up. \nThe LE comes standard with 19-inch wheels, automatic  headlights, foglights, a windshield wiper de-icer, privacy glass, a blind-spot  mirror, keyless entry, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, an  eight-way power driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, reclining  rear seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a cargo cover, Bluetooth phone  and audio connectivity and a six-speaker sound system with a touchscreen  interface, a CD player, an auxiliary audio jack and an iPod/USB audio  interface. The V6-powered Venza gets 20-inch wheels.\nThe LE Convenience package adds a power liftgate and a  rearview camera. The LE Preferred package adds these items plus a panoramic  sunroof, a navigation system and Toyota's Entune suite of smartphone-based app  services.\nThe XLE trim includes the Convenience package items plus  keyless ignition/entry, leather upholstery, heated front seats, driver seat  memory functions, a four-way power passenger seat, Entune, satellite radio and  HD radio with iTunes tagging. The XLE Premium package adds the panoramic  sunroof, a larger (6.1-inch) touchscreen interface, a navigation system,  traffic updates (plus other services) and a 13-speaker JBL sound system.\nThe Limited trim level includes the Premium package items  plus bi-xenon headlights, automatic high beams, LED running lights, front and  rear parking sensors, and an upgraded navigation system with a  higher-resolution 7-inch touchscreen display. There is a tow package available  on all V6-powered Venzas.",

    "full_description": "For 2010, the Toyota Tundra receives a more powerful midrange V8 as well as the high-end Platinum and stripped-down Work Truck packages. Other changes include minor cosmetic tweaks, the addition of front-seat knee airbags, and added options that include two new audio choices, a power vertical rear window, folding tow mirrors and an in-mirror back-up camera display. Despite being one of the oldest full-size pickups now available, the 2010 Toyota Tundra's strong performance and excellent utility make it a top choice for a workhorse pickup. The full-size pickup market has gone though a lot of upheaval in the past year few years, with almost all the competing trucks in this segment receiving full redesigns. The Toyota Tundra proved itself worthy in our most recent full-size truck comparison test, narrowly missing 1st place among the stalwart models from Chevy, Dodge and Ford. This highly respectable finish is due in no small part to the Tundra's burly chassis and powerful 5.7-liter V8 engine option, and the truck's handling precision also helped make it one of the most confidence-inspiring trucks to drive as well.For 2010, the Tundra also gets a new midrange V8 that now pumps out 310 horsepower -- that's 39 additional horses, yet fuel economy improves by 2 mpg. This V8 now boasts the best combination of power and fuel economy among full-size V8 pickups, with enough towing capability for most full-size truck owners. Returning is the optional (and quite potent) 381-hp 5.7-liter V8 for those who need to do serious hauling.The 2010 Toyota Tundra lineup has also been expanded to offer trim packages on opposite ends of the spectrum. The new Platinum Package adds features usually associated with luxury cars, while the Work Truck Package is the Tundra's new bare-bones workhorse intended mostly for businesses.As good as the Tundra is, the recently redesigned Dodge Ram and Ford F-150 are now as good or better than the Toyota. In comparison, the Tundra's interior trades function for form -- the gauges are hard to read and its frequently used controls are difficult to reach. Meanwhile, the Tundra's occasionally bouncy and unsettled ride quality is that much more apparent this year due to the arrival of the impressively smooth-riding Dodge Ram.On the whole, though, the Tundra still has the sturdy platform that most truck buyers are looking for. During our long-term test, we found it immensely capable when it came to towing and hauling, and it was also comfortable, durable and spacious. Plus, with its new midgrade V8, you no longer need to pony up for the biggest engine. Full-size truck buyers would be well-advised to take a serious look at the 2010 Toyota Tundra when shopping the domestic brands. This workhorse still has plenty going for it. The 2010 Toyota Tundra is available with a choice of three engines and is offered in either two- or four-wheel drive. The 4x2 Tundra regular cab and standard bed 4x2 Double Cab come standard with a 4.0-liter V6 producing 236 hp and 266 pound-feet of torque. This engine is mated to a five-speed automatic transmission -- manual gearboxes are not available on the Tundra. The EPA estimates fuel economy for this engine at 15 mpg city/19 mpg highway and 16 mpg combined. Given these figures, we'd skip it. Optional on these models and standard on all other Tundras is a new 4.6-liter V8 with 310 hp and 327 lb-ft of torque. Fuel economy with this V8 is 15/20/17 (14/19/16 with 4WD). This engine comes standard with a six-speed automatic transmission with manual shift control. Equipped with the tow package and depending on body style, the Tundra 4.6 can tow up to 8,600 pounds.Optional on all Tundras is a muscular 5.7-liter V8 that produces 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque. The six-speed automatic is similarly standard here. When fitted with the big V8, this truck is seriously quick, as a CrewMax SR5 4x4 we tested went from zero to 60 mph in just 6.9 seconds. Fuel economy is an estimated 13/17/14 mpg (14/18/16 with two-wheel drive). Equipped with the tow package and depending on body style, the Tundra 5.7 can tow up to 10,800 pounds. Antilock disc brakes, traction control, stability control, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags are all standard, as are front-seat knee airbags for 2010. As of this writing, government crash tests have not yet been published for the 2010 model, but last year's Tundra scored four stars out of five in frontal impact tests for both driver and passenger. In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's frontal-offset crash testing, the 2009 Tundra also earned the highest possible \"Good\" rating. In side-impact crash testing, a Tundra Double Cab also achieved a \"Good\" rating. The 5.7-liter V8 makes the 2010 Toyota Tundra one of the quickest pickups on and off the road, while the engine's delivery is impressively smooth. Shifts from the six-speed automatic transmission are prompt, and the console shifter's precise action makes it easy to use the manual mode while tackling steep highway grades or off-road challenges. Towing a sizable trailer is similarly no problem, as the truck can maintain its speed up steep grades without having to resort to full-throttle applications. The truck is similarly capable off-road when equipped with the TRD Off-Road Package.For normal, daily use, the Tundra's light steering makes the truck very easy to drive, though at times it feels bigger than competing trucks. We were satisfied with the Tundra's ride quality a few years ago, but the new Dodge Ram's rear coil spring suspension and the Ford F-150's sturdier frame make the Tundra's ride seem jiggly by comparison. The 2010 Toyota Tundra's interior has not seen a refresh since this current generation debuted in 2007 and in the face of redesigned Dodge and Ford trucks, the Tundra's cabin isn't as appealing as it once was. Specific complaints we have include audio controls that are out of comfortable reach for the driver, gauges that are less than legible, and interior materials quality that now trails behind the competition. The new Platinum Package addresses some of these deficiencies, but for drivers who intend on using the Tundra for work or play, the regular interior treatment should suffice.The regular cab offers comfortable seats as well as a generous amount of interior cargo space. In Double Cabs, the backseat is fully usable for adults, while the CrewMax offers the roomiest rear seat of any pickup truck. With a limolike 44.5 inches of rear legroom, even 6-footers can stretch out and cross their legs. Standard Grade features for regular cab models include 18-inch steel wheels, a 40/20/40-split cloth bench seat, a tilt steering wheel, dual-zone manual climate control, a stereo with CD and auxiliary audio jack and rubber flooring. Upgrading to larger cab models adds a power-sliding rear window, full power accessories, fold-up rear seats, cruise control and carpeting. Bucket seats, a console-mounted shifter and a tilt-telescoping steering wheel can be added with the Bucket Seat Package. Those items are included on the Limited trim level along with alloy wheels, a utility rail system for cargo, automatic climate control, an upgraded sound system with CD changer, satellite radio, iPod connectivity, Bluetooth, steering-wheel audio controls, front and rear parking sensors and power-adjustable leather seats and overhead and center console storage.Availability on option packages can get quite complicated and depend largely on the chosen body style. The popular SR5 package adds many of the features from the larger cab models to the regular cab along with engine skid plates. The SR5-equipped Double Cab and CrewMax models add towing and cold weather packages. Also very popular are two off-road packages that vastly improve the handling dynamics when venturing off pavement, with an upgraded suspension, trail-capable tires and wheels, skid plates and various cosmetic cues. Other packages largely enhance the Tundra's appearance. New for 2010 Tundras are the Platinum and Work Truck packages. The Platinum package, available on Limited CrewMax models, is the fully loaded Tundra with nearly every available option -- basically turning it into a Lexus pickup. The Work Truck Package goes decidedly downscale by adding vinyl seating, eliminating nearly every comfort and convenience feature, and is available only on regular and Double Cab models.",

    "full_description": "The 2013 Toyota Avalon is fully redesigned. With new features and a new look for 2013, the Toyota Avalon should earn new respect as a top choice for a full-size sedan.Notably, we picked the 2013 Toyota Avalon as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars, Trucks and SUVs. As Toyota flirted with its status as the world's largest  automaker, the company seemingly forgot about building appealing cars that  connected with drivers on a visual and emotional level. A recently redesigned  Camry sent the first signal that Toyota was serious about making interesting  cars again. Next up: the 2013 Toyota Avalon.\nA wide-mouth lower grille accentuates the Avalon's new front  end, while hood channels and narrow headlamp lenses contribute to a more  forceful presentation. The Avalon looks sleeker in profile, a result of the car's  rear roof pillars that sweep more purposefully toward the trunk. The rear end,  meanwhile, is pulled together more tightly, with LED taillamps extending onto  the trunk lid and tied together with a sweeping chrome strip.\nThe Avalon remains front-wheel drive, but overall it's  slightly shorter and wider than the previous model. A stiffer body, thanks to  increased bracing, and revised suspension settings deliver an improved ride and  more assured handling, while still providing ample comfort. The Avalon's engine  is pretty much unchanged, however, so you're looking at a still impressively  smooth 3.5-liter V6 that generates a respectable 268 horsepower and 25 mpg  combined on the EPA cycle. \nDespite the new Avalon's smaller dimensions, interior room  is actually up thanks to a greater range of seat adjustments and more efficient  sunroof packaging. The trunk is also larger and there are new features such as a  premium JBL sound system, navigation, adaptive cruise control, heated and  ventilated seats, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. However,  the biggest departure is interior materials quality. The last Avalon had quite  a few disappointing, hard interior bits that paled in comparison to those in  key rivals. The new car, however, feels like a luxury car both in terms of  quality and its eye-catching design.\nToyota is positioning the 2013 Avalon as an  American sedan, designed and built in the United States and catering to American  tastes. With its distinctive new look and improved interior, the new Avalon is  an impressive package that puts it back in front after several competitors  notched ahead of the previous model. Although looking at the 2013 Buick LaCrosse, 2013  Chrysler 300 or 2013 Hyundai Azera would be wise, we have no problem  saying the new Toyota Avalon has more than enough merits to be a top choice for  a large sedan. The 2013 Toyota Avalon comes with a 3.5-liter V6 that  generates 268 hp and 248 pound-feet of torque. Power is sent to the front  wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission. Estimated fuel economy  stands at 21 mpg city/31 mpg highway and 25 mpg combined. Standard  safety features for the Avalon include traction and stability control, antilock  disc brakes, front and rear seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and front knee  airbags. Touring and Limited models also come with blind-spot monitoring and  rear cross-traffic alert. A pre-collision warning system is optional on the  Limited. The first thought when driving the 2013 Toyota Avalon might  be: \"Is this really the Avalon?\" It seems that the redesign has also  provided a personality change. The stiffer body is immediately apparent by  delivering an assured ride but one that is still comfortable. Designers have  firmed up the steering to provide more road feel, while the brakes are nicely  tuned to match the increased responsiveness of the drivetrain.\nThe engine is smooth and powerful and will provide plenty of  acceleration to please most drivers. Although Avalon buyers in love with the  previous car's indifferent dynamics might be a little disappointed with the new  car, overall we think this sedan offers a nice blend of comfort and useful performance. The Avalon's interior is spacious and elegant, with high-quality  materials throughout. The dash has an unusual layered layout dividing it into  different zones for instrument panel, center console and front passenger area.  The effect is tied together with chrome flashing that is attractive but catches  the sun in bright light. All the controls are intuitively arranged and nicely  weighted for a quality feeling, however.\nThe front seats are very  comfortable and highly adjustable, with plenty of side bolstering and lumbar  support for both the driver and the front passenger. The Avalon's rear seats are  so roomy that Toyota is actually offering a livery model of this car. The  generous trunk offers 16 cubic feet of space, with a wide access and low  liftover. \nGauges are sharp and stylish and the center screen is large  and easy to read for navigation directions or vehicle operation information. Its  audio controls are well-sorted, too. Storage compartments are especially well  thought out and provide ample room for drinks and personal effects. The lower  section of the center console provides a convenient \"eBin\" with power  cords passing through a sliding panel for two cell phones and auxiliary and USB  connections. A large center armrest provides more storage space and additional  connectivity and charging for cell phones. \nThe Avalon XLE Premium is very similar but has upgraded  keyless ignition/entry (additional functionality for rear doors and trunk), an  auto-dimming rearview mirror and a rearview camera. The Touring has 18-inch  wheels, foglights, upgraded leather upholstery, a 10-way power driver seat, an  eight-way power front passenger seat, heated rear seats, a navigation system,  Toyota's Entune smartphone app integration system and a nine-speaker audio  system with satellite and HD radio.\nGoing with the Avalon Limited gets you all of the above plus  xenon headlights, auto-dimming side mirrors, rain-sensing wipers, tri-zone  automatic climate control, ventilated front seats, a rear power sunshade, a  7-inch touchscreen display and an 11-speaker JBL premium sound system.\nThe only option for the Avalon is a Tech package for the  Limited that includes adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlights  and a pre-collision system.",

    "full_description": "For 2017, the Toyota Tundra is unchanged other than some slight revisions to standard equipment. By most measures, there is a lot to  like about the 2017 Toyota Tundra. After all, this is a brawny, full-size truck  that can tow up to 10,500 pounds or haul just over a ton of cargo. You also get  your choice of one of two available V8 engines. And with a lineup that runs the  gamut from basic work truck to posh personal pickup or off-road bruiser,  there's bound to be a Tundra that suits your needs.  \nUnfortunately, times have changed in  the full-size pickup segment, and the Tundra hasn't seen an all-new generation  debut since the 2007 model year. As such, the 2017 Tundra can't match the  advancements the current segment leaders have made in some areas. The Ford  F-150, for example, offers a weight-saving aluminum body and an optional  turbocharged V6 engine that delivers substantial towing and hauling capability  with much better fuel economy. Also on that must-consider list should be the  Ram 1500 with its available fuel-efficient EcoDiesel powertrain and  smooth-riding coil spring rear suspension. The Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and new  Nissan Titan (and heavier-duty Nissan Titan XD) are worth a look, too.\nUltimately, the made-in-America 2017  Toyota Tundra has its share of good qualities, but it's not enough to push it  to the top of the full-size truck category this year. Standard safety equipment on the  2017 Toyota Tundra includes antilock brakes, stability and traction control,  trailer sway control, front side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags and front  knee airbags. A rearview camera is standard on all models. A blind-spot  monitoring system, rear cross-traffic alert and parking sensors are optional on  the SR5 and Limited; they come standard on the Platinum and 1794 Edition.\nIn government crash testing, the  Tundra received four out of five stars for overall crash protection, with four  stars for front-crash protection and five stars for side-impact protection. The  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Tundra extended cab its top  rating of Good in the moderate-overlap front impact, side-impact, roof strength  and seat/head restraint (whiplash protection) tests. \nDuring an Edmunds braking test, a  Tundra 1794 with 4WD came to a stop from 60 mph in 130 feet, which is about  average for the segment. A 4WD TRD Pro took 134 feet, which isn't much farther,  especially considering its all-terrain tires. At slow parking lot speeds, the 2017  Toyota Tundra seems almost nimble thanks to a light steering feel. That same  quality persists at higher speeds, however, where it becomes a liability that  contributes (along with the big truck's weight and overall dimensions) to the  Tundra's ponderous handling. Another downside is the Tundra's stiff ride  quality. Though you expect as much with a truck, some rival trucks are more  comfortable. \nThe 5.7-liter V8 impresses thanks in  large part to its generous torque output and smooth-shifting six-speed  automatic transmission. If you don't think you'll need the Tundra's maximum  towing capacity, you'll find the 4.6-liter V8 provides adequate performance  with ever-so-slightly better fuel economy, though both engines lag behind the  category leaders on this point. The 2017 Toyota Tundra features an  attractive cabin filled with user-friendly technology. Even base models get the  automaker's Entune touchscreen interface with smartphone connectivity, and  higher trim levels get larger screens with more capabilities. It's an easy  system to use, though we prefer the overall look and functionality of the  infotainment systems found in the F-150 (Sync 3) and Ram 1500 (Uconnect). \nSeating comfort up front is as good  as you'd expect. The rear seats in Double Cab models are noticeably roomier  than those of other rival trucks' extended-cab models. The CrewMax crew cab's  rear seat is notable for its abundant splayed-out legroom and its reclining  seatback that make it arguably the most comfortable spot in the entire truck.  The flip-up bottom cushions in back also provide plenty of storage for tools or  other valuable items you'd prefer not to leave exposed in the open bed.  \nDepending on which body style you  choose, there are up to six trim levels for the Tundra: SR, SR5, TRD Pro,  Limited, Platinum and a 1794 Edition. The availability of some options or  packages can vary based on the region in which you live.\nThe base SR (regular and  extended-cab body styles only) comes standard with 18-inch steel wheels,  daytime running lights, heated power mirrors, a windshield wiper de-icer, a  damped tailgate, keyless entry, air-conditioning, cloth upholstery, a  40/20/40-split bench seat, cruise control, full power accessories, a rearview  camera, an integrated trailer brake controller, a tilt-only steering wheel,  Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, and a six-speaker sound system with a  6.1-inch touchscreen interface, a CD player, an auxiliary audio input jack and  a USB port. The SR Work Truck package replaces the cloth upholstery and carpet  with vinyl surfaces and removes the power locks and windows.\nGoing with the SR5 (extended- and  crew-cab body styles only) gets you foglights, variable intermittent windshield  wipers, exterior chrome trim, 60/40-split folding rear seats and an upgraded  tech interface that includes a 7-inch touchscreen, HD and satellite radio,  traffic information and a navigation app. The crew cab adds a power-opening  rear window and an overhead console. The SR5 Upgrade package adds front bucket  seats that include a driver seat with power height and lumbar adjustments, a  center console (with storage and \"floor\" shifter), a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a larger gas tank when  equipped with the 5.7-liter V8. To that package, the Safety & Convenience  package adds front and rear parking sensors, a blind-spot monitoring system and  rear cross-traffic alert. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels can be added as a  stand-alone option.\nThe TRD Pro includes the SR5 Upgrade  package items plus black 18-inch alloy wheels, off-road tires, an off-road  suspension that includes Bilstein shock absorbers, four movable bed tie-down  cleats and unique styling elements, plus leather upholstery with the TRD logo  and red stitching, an eight-way power driver seat, a four-way power front  passenger seat, an upgraded 7-inch touchscreen (optional on the SR5), a  navigation system and additional speakers (seven on extended cab, nine on crew  cab).\nThe Limited (extended and crew cabs  only) builds on the base and Upgrade SR5 option package equipment with 20-inch  alloy wheels, automatic headlights, the movable tie-down cleats, automatic  dual-zone climate control, leather upholstery, an eight-way power driver seat,  a four-way power passenger seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a power  horizontal-sliding rear window (extended cab), a navigation system and  additional speakers (seven in the extended cab, nine in the crew cab). The  Limited Premium package adds the Safety & Convenience package items plus  extra interior lighting and anti-theft alarm features. A sunroof is optional on  crew-cab models.\nAt the top of the heap, the Platinum  trim level (crew cab only) comes standard with the Safety & Convenience  package items and adds to the Limited's equipment with unique 20-inch wheels  and distinctive styling elements, LED daytime running lights, power-folding and  auto-dimming mirrors, a sunroof, heated and ventilated power front seats  (10-way driver, four-way passenger), driver-seat memory functions and a  12-speaker JBL sound system (optional on the Limited crew cab). The 1794  Edition really only differs from the Platinum in terms of its exclusive  exterior and interior styling elements.\nThe TRD Off-Road package can be  added to the SR5, Limited and 1794 Edition. It includes 18-inch TRD wheels,  off-road tires, trail-tuned shock absorbers, skid plates and tow hooks.\nStand-alone options on most trim  levels include heated tow mirrors and running boards. The 2017 Toyota Tundra is offered  with a choice of two V8 engines. A six-speed automatic transmission and  rear-wheel drive (2WD) are standard; four-wheel drive (4WD) with a two-speed  transfer case is optional.\nA 4.6-liter V8 that produces 310  horsepower and 327 pound feet of torque is standard on SR extended-cab and all  SR5 models.  EPA fuel economy estimates are 16 mpg combined (15 city/19 highway) on 2WD  models and 16 mpg combined (14 city/18 highway) on 4WD versions. Properly  equipped, the maximum towing capacity with the 4.6-liter engine is 6,800  pounds.\nA 5.7-liter V8 that puts out 381 hp  and 401 lb-ft of torque is standard on the regular cab and all variations of  the Limited, Platinum, 1794 and TRD Pro. It is optional on SR5 models. EPA fuel  economy estimates are 15 mpg combined (13 city/18 highway) with 2WD and 15  combined (13 city/17 highway) with 4WD. All Tundras equipped with the 5.7-liter  V8 come with a standard tow package. Properly equipped, the tow rating of  models with the 5.7-liter engine tops out at 10,500 pounds.\nIn Edmunds testing, a Tundra with  the 5.7-liter V8 and four-wheel drive accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 6.8  seconds, and a Tundra TRD Pro did it in 6.7 seconds. These are both average  times for the segment.",

    "full_description": "For 2015, the Toyota Tacoma drops the regular cab body style -- now it's just the extended cab (Access Cab) and the crew cab (Double Cab). Also, the off-road-equipped TRD TX Baja version of the Tacoma has been replaced by the TRD Pro package. Thanks to its strong engines, variety of configurations and versatile interior, the 2015 Toyota Tacoma remains a class leader. However, it's an older design, so we'd certainly recommend checking out GM's brand-new trucks if you're shopping for a midsize pickup.  If you're in the market for a new pickup truck, most of your  options today are pretty large. Still, there are a handful of midsize pickup  trucks like the 2015 Toyota Tacoma that have stood the test of time and provide  a considerable measure of utility for buyers who don't need the towing and  hauling abilities of the goliaths.\nAlthough the 2015 Tacoma is largely the same truck that  debuted back in 2005, there's a lot to recommend it after all these years, and  it has earned an Edmunds.com  \"B\" rating. To start, both of its available engines are viable  choices. The standard four-cylinder engine provides decent performance and  impressive fuel economy, while the available V6 turns the Tacoma into one of the  quicker trucks in this class and offers ample grunt for towing. Beyond that,  the Tacoma is relatively easy to maneuver and park for its size, and if you opt  for its available off-road packages, it's one of the most capable vehicles on  the road. Indeed, the available TRD Pro model is likely the most dirt-friendly pickup on the planet. Inside, all Toyota  Tacomas come standard with Bluetooth and a 6.1-inch touchscreen, and tech  features like mobile app integration and a rearview camera are available.\nIn spite of these strengths, the current Tacoma is beginning  to show its age. The cabin feels cheap in places with lots of hard plastic  surfaces, and although there's plenty of room, the seats have flat cushioning  and are mounted low to the floor, which doesn't help road-trip comfort. And  while the available engines provide decent fuel economy and power, they're  pretty noisy when pushed for acceleration. Go to slow down and you'll find the  braking performance satisfactory, but the pedal is squishy and difficult to  apply smoothly, which doesn't inspire confidence. We're also a little sorry to  see the Tacoma's regular cab body style go this year. Toyota was the last automaker to offer a  midsize pickup with a regular cab, and while the extended and crew cab  configurations are far more practical, the regular cab provided an affordable  entry point to truck ownership.\nOn the whole, though, the 2015 Toyota Tacoma is a pretty solid  bet for a midsize pickup truck. The 2015 Chevrolet Colorado and 2015 GMC Canyon make  their debuts this year. They have slightly higher towing capacities, civilized  ride quality and much more modern interiors. The 2015 Nissan Frontier is  your other option in this class. It's just as old as the Tacoma and offers much  of the same versatility and similar off-road capability. However, its  four-cylinder engine is weaker and less fuel-efficient, and its crew cab's backseat  is not as roomy. Although GM's brand-new trucks certainly hold the edge, within  the small class of midsize trucks, the 2015 Toyota Tacoma still has plenty of  appeal. The 2015 Toyota Tacoma is available with rear- or four-wheel  drive and a choice of two engines: a 2.7-liter four-cylinder or a 4.0-liter V6.\nThe Tacoma comes standard with a four-cylinder engine rated  at 159 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed manual  transmission is standard on Access Cab models, while the rear-drive-only  PreRunner Access and Double Cabs get a standard four-speed automatic that's  optional on the others.\nA rear-wheel-drive Tacoma with the four-cylinder and  five-speed manual returns an EPA-estimated 22 mpg combined (21 city/25 highway), dropping to 21 mpg combined (19/24) with the automatic. Pair the four-cylinder engine with four-wheel drive  and the EPA estimates 19 mpg combined with either transmission.\nThe V6 is rated at 236 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. The V6  comes with either a five-speed automatic transmission or a six-speed manual.\nWith the V6 and the automatic transmission, the EPA  estimates 19 mpg  combined (17/21) with rear-wheel drive and 18 mpg combined (16/21) with four-wheel drive. The V6 paired with the six-speed manual returns 18 mpg combined (16/21) with rear-wheel drive and 17 mpg combined (15/19) with 4WD.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, a 4WD Tacoma Double Cab V6  with the automatic covered zero to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds, which is suitably  quick for a midsize truck. Properly equipped, a Tacoma V6 can tow up to 6,500  pounds. Standard safety equipment on the 2015 Toyota Tacoma includes  antilock brakes (front disc, rear drum) with brake assist, stability control,  front-seat side-impact airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and front  active head restraints. A rearview camera is optional.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, a Double Cab 4WD V6 Tacoma stopped  from 60 mph in 132 feet, an average distance for the segment.\nIn government crash testing, the Toyota Tacoma received an overall  rating of four stars out of five. Crew cabs received three out of five  stars for frontal crash impact protection, while extended-cab Tacomas received  four stars. All Tacomas received five stars for side crash protection.\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Tacoma  its top  rating of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal offset and side  crash tests, but its second-to-worst rating of \"Marginal\" in the roof  strength test. Its seat/head restraint design was rated \"Good\" for  whiplash protection in rear impacts. The four-cylinder Tacoma can seem overly noisy, and its  performance certainly isn't going to blow anyone's doors off, but thanks to a  healthy 180 lb-ft of torque, it actually packs a decent punch. This engine is a  smart choice for small-business types, as it gets respectable fuel economy without  being entirely gutless. The V6 engine is considerably brawnier, of course, and  it's a no-brainer if you plan to do any serious towing.\nOn paved surfaces, the 2015 Toyota Tacoma rides firmly,  particularly with one of the TRD suspension setups. It's not objectionable, and  the new TRD Pro suspension is much more comfortable than the TX it replaces. The  Tacoma's soft brake pedal feel fails to inspire confidence, even though the  brakes' actual performance is just fine. Off-road, however, the Tacoma 4WD is a  star, providing serious capability in an unassuming package. The comprehensive  TRD Off-Road package is tempting (especially if you like loud exhaust pipes),  but it's largely meant for serious off-roaders. Meanwhile, the four-cylinder  4WD Access Cab is one of the best go-anywhere bargains you'll find. Although it's not especially modern or attractive, the 2015  Toyota Tacoma's cabin features a straightforward dashboard layout that puts  practicality first, including simple three-dial climate knobs that are easily  turned by gloved hands. Most panels are made of hard plastic, but build quality  is perennially strong. Feature content is generally impressive, headlined by  the standard touchscreen display with iPod/USB and Bluetooth connectivity.\nThe front bucket seats offer firm support, but the  cushioning is pretty flat, and many drivers will find that their low mounting  points relative to the floor hamper comfort. While the Access Cab's rear jump  seats are fit only for small children or cargo, the Double Cab's backseat is  surprisingly adult-friendly, especially compared with the cramped Frontier crew  cab. In both cab styles, the rear seats flip up or fold down to provide an  enclosed storage space.\nThe Tacoma's utility is enhanced by the standard composite  bedliner, which guards against the dents and dings that typically accumulate in  a truck bed. The optional bed-mounted 115-volt power outlet can be a real asset  when you're on the job, and it'll also win you friends and admirers when you're  camping or tailgating. \nStandard features on the rear-drive (two-wheel-drive) Tacoma  Access Cab include 15-inch steel wheels, a limited-slip rear differential, power  locks and windows, air-conditioning, a composite bedliner, a bed utility rail  system, cloth upholstery, fold-up rear seats with underseat storage, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a  6.1-inch Entune touchscreen display  and an audio system with a CD player, iPod/USB connectivity and an auxiliary  audio jack. A sliding rear window is optional. \nThe 2WD Double Cab adds black fenders, power mirrors,  adjustable driver lumbar, a 60/40-split rear bench seat with adjustable  headrests and rear bulkhead storage.\nSpecifying four-wheel drive on any base Tacoma brings an  increased ride height, 16-inch steel wheels, black fenders (already standard on  Double Cab), an engine skid plate and front mud guards. The PreRunner, offered  in both Access and Double Cab configurations, is a rear-wheel-drive Tacoma that  otherwise shares the standard features found on the 4WD Tacoma.\nThe Access Cab is eligible for the Convenience package (called  the Convenience Extra Value package on the Double Cab), which adds keyless  entry, power mirrors (Access Cab only), cruise control, a tinted sliding rear  window and steering-wheel audio controls. The SR5 package includes those items  plus chrome grille and rear bumper trim, color-keyed front bumper and fenders,  foglights (V6 only), adjustable driver lumbar support (already standard on  Double Cab), unique seat fabric, variable intermittent wipers, metallic-look  instrument panel trim, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and (automatic-only)  shift knob, dual sun visors with mirrors and extenders and a rearview camera.\nSeparately available, the SR package (available only with  the PreRunner package or 4WD Tacomas) adds extended color-keyed exterior trim,  exclusive black 16-inch alloy wheels, mirror-mounted turn signals, smoked  headlights and (on V6 models) foglights.\nV6-powered PreRunners and 4WD Tacomas are additionally  eligible for the TRD Off-Road package, which includes the SR5 package plus a  heavy-duty suspension with Bilstein shocks, a locking rear differential,  Hill-Start Assist and Downhill Assist (4WD automatic models only), 16-inch  alloy wheels, TRD graphics, a 115-volt power point in the bed and sport seats. Alternatively,  the TRD Sport package features a sport-tuned suspension (also with Bilsteins),  17-inch alloy wheels, a hood scoop, extended color-keyed exterior trim, the  bed-mounted power outlet and essentially the same interior features as the TRD  Off-Road package.\nThe TRD Pro offers the same off-road flair as the TRD  Off-Road package, with much of the same equipment, plus a more aggressive look,  unique paint, cat-back exhaust, an increased front ride height and side  graphics.\nFinally, the Limited package (V6 Double Cabs only) includes  the SR5 package's items plus 18-inch chrome wheels, extended chrome exterior  trim, an auto-dimming rearview mirror with an outside temperature gauge and  Home Link, heated front seats, synthetic leather upholstery, a seven-speaker JBL  audio system and a higher-resolution touchscreen with HD radio, satellite  radio, a navigation system and the Entune mobile-app suite.\nTacoma V6 Double Cabs can also be equipped with the JBL  audio system as a stand-alone option, while the upgraded touchscreen is  available separately on both Access and Double Cabs, with or without navigation  and Entune mobile apps.",

    "full_description": "The 2009 Toyota Sienna is unchanged other than minor feature revisions. There's a new option package for the Sienna LE that includes Bluetooth and rear-seat entertainment, and the XLE's optional parking sensors now cover both the front and rear of the van. Roomy, comfortable and well-built, the 2009 Toyota Sienna minivan is an excellent choice for larger families. Five years ago, the Toyota Sienna was completely redesigned. Since then, we've consistently praised the Sienna as a top choice in its segment, deeming it luxurious, roomy and even Lexus-like in its refinement. The 2009 Toyota Sienna is unchanged from last year, but it remains one of the best minivans you can buy. Competition is fierce in this segment, but the Sienna boasts Toyota's familiar 3.5-liter V6, an all-star engine renowned for its smooth power and laudable fuel efficiency. Another feather in the Sienna's cap is the fact that it's currently the only minivan to offer all-wheel drive, so if you live where ice and snow are common, the Sienna has a decided advantage over its rivals.In CE and LE trim, the Sienna can accommodate eight passengers; XLE and Limited models offer seating for seven, thanks to captain's chairs in the second row. The Limited version is especially luxurious, and it wouldn't be that far off to call it the Lexus of minivans. Gathered leather on the doors, comfortable captain's chairs, a JBL sound system and the option of adaptive cruise control almost make the Toyota logo on the steering wheel seem like a mistake.  When it comes to handling prowess, the 2009 Toyota Sienna doesn't offer a particularly compelling package. Of course, no minivan is going to be purchased on the strength of its corner-carving ability, but the Sienna's archnemesis, the Honda Odyssey, happens to deliver responsive handling along with a reasonably smooth ride. The Kia Sedona/Hyundai Entourage twins are also satisfying alternatives, especially for those put off by Toyota's typically higher prices. But overall, the Sienna is an excellent van with many compelling features and options. We wouldn't buy another minivan without trying the Sienna first. All Siennas come with a 266-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6 engine that's matched to a five-speed automatic transmission. This refined combination provides brisk acceleration (we timed an AWD version of the XLE from zero to 60 mph in just 8.0 seconds) as well as respectable fuel economy. EPA estimates for 2009 come in at 17 mpg city/23 mpg highway and 19 mpg combined for front-wheel-drive models; the AWD versions are rated at 16 city/21 highway and 18 combined. Antilock disc brakes, stability control, traction control and a full complement of airbags (including front-seat side and full-length side curtain) are standard on all Siennas. The Limited also comes with front and rear park assist; it's optional on the XLE. If you opt for the navigation system, you'll also get a rearview camera.In government crash testing, the 2009 Toyota Sienna earned four stars (out of five possible) for driver protection in frontal impacts and five stars for the front passenger. It also received five stars across the board for side-impact crash protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave Toyota's minivan a \"good\" rating (the highest possible score) for its performance in frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. Although the 2009 Toyota Sienna's automatic transmission is calibrated more for fuel economy than performance, there's no denying the refined potency of the van's V6. When you step into it, acceleration is spirited, yet the engine delivers its power in a smooth and unobtrusive manner. Ride quality is plush, but the Sienna offers minimal steering feedback and considerable body roll during cornering. Braking distances are class-competitive, but the pedal feels too soft to inspire confidence. The Sienna's cabin is handsomely fitted with high-quality fabric on lower trim levels and leather and faux wood on the higher-end models. The various controls are simple to use, storage space is plentiful and the seats are plush. Seven-passenger Siennas allow the second-row captain's chairs to be pushed together to create a bench seat. The eight-passenger version uses a 40/20/40-split second-row bench whose center section slides 13 inches closer to the front seats for easier access to the little one seated there. The Sienna provides a cavernous 149 cubic feet of cargo capacity. In Limited trim, the Sienna's interior looks and feels as if it came straight out of a luxury car. The base Sienna CE includes 16-inch steel wheels, dual sliding rear doors with power-down windows, front and rear air-conditioning, a six-speaker CD/MP3 stereo with an auxiliary audio jack, a telescoping steering wheel and full power accessories. The LE adds privacy and solar energy-absorbing glass, a roof rack, heated side mirrors, a CD changer, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, a folding front passenger seat, cruise control and upgraded instrumentation.The Sienna XLE features alloy wheels, power-sliding rear doors, a power liftgate, automatic headlamps, tri-zone automatic climate control, power front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, wood grain interior trim, a trip computer and a removable center console. The plush Limited adds 17-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof, adaptive cruise control, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a leather-and-wood steering wheel, an upgraded 10-speaker JBL sound system, satellite radio, Bluetooth, rear window shades and a windshield-wiper de-icer. All-wheel-drive Siennas receive 17-inch wheels, run-flat tires and the wiper de-icer.Options on the Toyota Sienna are grouped into packages that vary based on buying region, and they can get rather pricey. You'll need to study them carefully to ensure that the Sienna you pick has just what you want. Notable items include xenon headlights, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, a navigation system (with a back-up camera), a power-folding third-row seat and a pair of 115-volt power outlets. A new package for the LE combines a JBL stereo with Bluetooth and rear-seat entertainment.",

    "full_description": "The 2012 Toyota Tacoma gets updated styling inside and out, plus several new high-tech entertainment features. The 2012 Toyota Tacoma is a top choice in the midsize pickup segment thanks to its highly capable nature and wide array of configurations. While the word \"downsizing\" has developed some negative connotations in recent years, there's still something to be said for the concept. To illustrate our point, let's use the 2012 Toyota Tacoma as an example.\nIn an era where the price for a gallon of gasoline can be volatile, ditching your thirsty full-size pickup for something like the Tacoma makes a lot of sense. This downsizing also pays dividends in terms of everyday maneuverability, as the truck's smaller dimensions make it a lot less stressful to do everything from finding a parking spot at your local warehouse store to scooting through openings in traffic.\nThe fact that the Tacoma is offered with multiple body styles, engines, drivetrains, suspension setups and levels broadens its appeal from no-frills work truck to comfortable family transportation. And while it's true you'll be giving up some of the capabilities of a full-size truck, it's also important to ask yourself how many times you actually need to haul a dozen four-by-eight plywood sheets or tow a 10,000-pound trailer?\nA reputation for sturdy build quality and excellent reliability also puts the Tacoma on par with many of its full-size competitors. For 2012, the Tacoma also takes a clear lead in the arena of in-car electronics, adding Toyota's new Entune services to the options list. This includes Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, HD radio, satellite radio, text/e-mail reading, Pandora and iHeartRadio streaming, and real-time traffic info (among other things). If all that's not enough, a price tag that's significantly lower than for those big trucks should help seal the deal.\nThe 2012 Toyota Tacoma also compares favorably with its few remaining competitors in the midsize pickup segment. The cleverly designed Honda Ridgeline is an attractive option for personal use, but lacks the burliness many pickup buyers demand. Ford and Dodge have already pulled out of the segment and GM's entries are so underwhelming at the moment they might as well head for the exits as well. That leaves the Nissan Frontier as the Tacoma's only serious competition. The Frontier is an equally capable and muscular-looking truck, but its interior isn't as spacious or refined. Add it all up and the Toyota Tacoma is one of the few midsize pickups appealing enough to give downsizing a good name. The 2012 Toyota Tacoma is available with two different  engines and a choice of rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive.\nMost configurations come standard with a 2.7-liter  four-cylinder engine that produces 159 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque.  A five-speed manual transmission is standard on Regular and Access Cab models,  while the PreRunner Double Cab gets a four-speed automatic that's also  available as an option on the other two body styles. EPA fuel economy numbers  for this engine in a two-wheel-drive automatic-equipped Tacoma are 19 mpg city/24  mpg highway and 21 mpg combined. With four-wheel drive and the automatic  transmission, the four-cylinder is rated at 18/21/19. The manual numbers are  slightly worse.\nA 4.0-liter V6 that puts out 236 hp and 266 lb-ft of  torque is standard on the four-wheel-drive Double Cab and X-Runner, and  available as an option on the Access Cab and PreRunner Double Cab. A six-speed  manual is standard with the V6, with a five-speed automatic available as an  option. EPA estimates for a two-wheel-drive, automatic-equipped V6 Tacoma come  in at 17/21/19, while the four-wheel-drive V6 is rated at 16/21/18.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, a V6-powered Tacoma  Double Cab turned in a 0-60-mph time of 7.7 seconds, which is suitably quick  for a midsize truck. Properly equipped, the Tacoma can tow 6,500 pounds. Standard safety equipment on the 2012 Toyota Tacoma  includes antilock brakes (front disc, rear drum) with brake assist, stability  and traction control, front-seat side-impact airbags, full-length side curtain  airbags and front active head restraints. Hill-start assist and downhill assist  are available on four-wheel-drive models equipped with the automatic  transmission.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, a Tacoma Double Cab came to  a stop from 60 mph in a short 126 feet.\nIn government crash testing, the 2012 Toyota Tacoma  Double Cab received an overall rating of four stars (out of a possible five), with  three stars for frontal crashes and five stars for side impacts. The Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety gave the Tacoma its top rating of \"Good\"  in its frontal-offset and side crash tests, but a second-to-worst rating of \"Marginal\"  in the roof strength test. Buyers who don't plan on hauling or towing heavy loads and who are trying to save some money out the door will find the 2.7-liter four-cylinder a perfectly acceptable choice. However, it's not especially more fuel-efficient than the brawnier V6, which is a better choice for both work and play thanks to its abundance of low-range pull. We think it's definitely worth the extra money.\nGenerally speaking, the 2012 Toyota Tacoma's ride quality and handling are decent enough on the pavement, though models fitted with the firmer suspensions can feel a little jittery with the bed empty. Properly equipped four-wheel-drive versions are also capable off-roaders. Braking performance is similarly competent, but the soft brake pedal doesn't do much to inspire confidence. The 2012 Toyota Tacoma's interior isn't fancy and  there's a fair amount of hard plastic about, but the space still ranks as the  nicest in this understandably utilitarian segment. The design has been upgraded  for 2012, replacing the old, dated silver-painted controls with a slicker black  surface. It's an attractive change, but most importantly, the gauges and  controls remain clear, straightforward and user-friendly. We do wish Toyota  would've added a few more storage bins in the cabin, however.\nFront bucket seats offer good comfort and support,  though some may find they are mounted too low to the floor. While the Access  Cab's rear jump seats are only fit for small children (and then only in a  pinch), the Double Cab's backseat is surprisingly adult-friendly, especially  compared to the squished confines of the Nissan Frontier. In both cases, rear  seats flip up or fold down to create protected storage for items you'd rather  not leave floating around in the bed. Speaking of which, the bed's composite  materials make dents and dings a non-issue, while the available bed-mounted  household-style 115-volt AC outlet is bound to come in handy for camping trips,  tailgate parties and other outdoor fun. \nAll three Tacoma body styles are offered in a choice of two- or four-wheel drive. Rear-wheel-drive PreRunner versions adopt the rugged look of their more off-road-capable siblings but without the added weight, reduced fuel economy and improved traction of actual four-wheel-drive versions. The rear-wheel-drive X-Runner model adopts a more street-oriented stance with a body kit, hood scoop, 18-inch alloy wheels, lowered sport-tuned suspension and standard V6, plus foglights and an upgraded sound system.\nIn its base trim level, the Tacoma Regular Cab is an ideal work truck with more standard amenities than other bare-bones pickups. Standard features include 15-inch steel wheels, a limited-slip differential, air-conditioning, a composite bedliner, a bed utility rail system, a cloth bench seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and a four-speaker sound system with a CD player, satellite radio and auxiliary audio jack. Four-wheel-drive versions equipped with an automatic transmission also get front bucket seats. The base model Access Cab gains upgraded cloth upholstery, front bucket seats, a rear bench with under-seat storage, power locks and windows, and a six-speaker sound system. The entry-level Tacoma Double Cab adds 16-inch steel wheels, a front skid plate, power mirrors, driver seat lumbar adjustment and an upgraded six-speaker sound system with an iPod/USB audio interface and Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity.\nMost options (which can vary by the region of the country in which the truck is sold) are grouped into packages with varying availability depending on your body style and drivetrain choices. The Convenience package adds a sliding rear window, privacy glass, keyless entry, cruise control, steering-wheel audio controls and power mirrors to Access Cabs. Several variations of the SR5 package (available on all but Regular Cabs and X-Runner Access Cab) typically combine exterior and interior upgrades like a chrome grille and rear bumper, the Convenience package items, foglights, variable-speed wipers, nicer cloth upholstery, a rearview camera and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Some of these items are available separately.\nThe TRD Off-Road package includes 16-inch alloy wheels, fender flares, a heavy-duty suspension, a locking rear differential, hill start assist and hill descent control (automatic only), skid plates, sport seats and the extra convenience items from SR5 and Convenience packages. The street-oriented TRD Sport package includes 17-inch alloy wheels, a hood scoop, a sport suspension, hill start assist and hill descent control (automatic only), sport seats and the extra convenience items from the SR5 and Convenience packages. The TRD Sport Upgrade package adds to the regular version 18-inch chrome-clad wheels.\nV6 Access and Double Cabs with the short bed can be equipped with the T|X and T|X Pro packages. The T|X adds unique black alloy wheels, all-terrain tires, black tube steps and a stainless-steel exhaust tip. The T|X Pro adds to those items a cat-back exhaust and special side graphics.\nV6-powered PreRunners and 4x4 Double Cabs can also be equipped with Display Audio with navigation, which includes a touchscreen electronics interface, a navigation system, a rearview camera, voice controls, HD radio and Toyota Entune real-time information and Internet music streaming.",

    "full_description": "For 2014, the Toyota Prius sees no notable changes other than the discontinuation of the Persona Series Special Edition. The 2014 Toyota Prius remains the quintessential hybrid car and a solid all-around choice, though other, newer hybrids are more enjoyable to drive. For the past decade, the Toyota Prius has dominated the hybrid car segment. In its early years, the Prius faced little competition, but these days there are plenty of compact and midsize hybrids in this price range. The fact that Toyota's iconic hybrid hatchback has remained number one is a testament to its packaging. The well-rounded 2014 Toyota Prius hits all the targets for most consumers shopping in this class.\nThe big contributor to the Prius' evergreen popularity is its amazing fuel economy -- the Prius' EPA combined rating of 50 mpg is topped only by the smaller Prius C and much more expensive plug-in hybrids such as the Chevrolet Volt. The Prius is also a pleasant car to drive in the daily grind. No, it won't raise the pulse of driving enthusiasts, but it is an easy-to-park, comfortable and spacious vehicle. And then there's the Prius' strong record for reliability and longevity. Considering all these practical attributes, it's no wonder you see Priuses used as taxicabs in many cities.\nStill, not all is perfect in Toyota Prius land. Some of the interior materials are subpar, and the driving position is awkward for taller people due to the steering wheel's limited range of telescoping adjustment. Furthermore, Toyota's hybrid faces much tougher rivals than in years past. While the Prius easily outclasses the Honda Insight, there is stiffer competition in the form of the recently introduced 2014 Ford C-Max Hybrid, which has a nicer interior and handles better to boot. If a versatile hatchback body style is not a must, midsize hybrid sedans like the 2014 Ford Fusion Hybrid, 2014 Honda Accord Hybrid and Toyota Camry Hybrid offer higher levels of comfort and refinement.\nYou should also factor in the higher up-front price of buying a hybrid car. Today's gasoline- and diesel-powered compact cars get great fuel economy and cost considerably less. When you weigh the Prius' higher price against its 50 mpg EPA rating, you should bear in mind that it might take years to realize a net savings over more conventional alternatives.\nThat said, the 2014 Toyota Prius remains the quintessential hybrid, and its blend of fuel efficiency, practicality, comfort and handy high-tech features makes it an easy choice in this segment. The 2014 Toyota Prius is powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine combined with a pair of electric motor/generators. Together they send a total output of 134 horsepower to the front wheels through a specialized continuously variable transmission (CVT).\nIn track testing, we clocked the Prius from zero to 60 mph in 10.1 seconds; that's about the same as the Insight, but slower than the C-Max Hybrid and the aforementioned hybrid midsize sedans. The EPA estimates the 2014 Prius will return a very impressive 50 mpg combined (51 mpg city/48 mpg highway). In real-world testing, we've found these estimates reasonably accurate. Every 2014 Toyota Prius comes standard with antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front side airbags, side curtain airbags and a driver knee airbag. The Prius Four and Five can be equipped with Toyota's Safety Connect emergency communications system, which includes emergency and roadside assistance, collision notification and stolen vehicle location. All but the Prius Two come standard with a rearview camera, while the Prius Five includes a frontal-collision warning system and a lane-departure warning system.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Prius came to a stop from 60 mph in 118 feet: very good for a compact or midsize car.\nIn government crash tests, the Prius received a rating of four stars (out of a possible five) for overall protection, with four stars for overall frontal protection and five stars for overall side protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Prius the highest possible rating of \"Good\" in its moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side and roof strength tests. Its seat/head restraint design was also rated \"Good\" for whiplash protection in rear impacts. Acceleration in the 2014 Toyota Prius is far from sprightly,  but it should be adequate for most buyers. Four driving modes -- Normal, Eco,  Power and EV -- allow the driver to choose the optimum powertrain configuration  depending on conditions. Eco is measured and sluggish, but returns the best  fuel economy. Power is useful for entering freeways or driving on hills. EV  mode locks out the gasoline engine, but only allows a maximum speed of 25 mph  and requires at least a half-charged battery pack.\nAround town, the Prius is an easy-to-drive runabout. The  steering doesn't provide much feedback, but it makes the car effortless to  maneuver in parking lots without feeling overly light at highway speeds. The  ride is generally comfortable, but nastier bumps can upset the suspension and  disturb the car's occupants. There is also an excessive amount of road noise  that permeates the cabin regardless of speed. Moreover, the noises emitted by the  Prius' small gasoline engine under hard acceleration are not what we'd describe  as sonorous. The 2014 Toyota Prius features straightforward controls that jut out toward the driver in a \"floating console\" that provides a storage tray underneath. It's stylish and also helps maximize cabin space. The digital instrument panel features a floating layer that displays audio, temperature and trip computer information when the driver touches those controls on the steering wheel, minimizing eye movement. Some drivers might find the overall design a bit too busy-looking, however.\nThe standard touchscreen operates many of the Prius' high-tech features and is, for the most part, smartly designed. The Entune system in the Prius Three and above can be a hassle, though, since you have to install an app on your phone and register for an account; plus, you always need an active data connection to use Entune.\nMaterials quality in the Prius is also disappointing, with harder and cheaper plastics than other cars in its price range. The corduroy-like texturing on the climate and audio controls seems nice at first, but collects oil from the skin and causes circular dark spots on most buttons.\nHowever, the Prius remains highly versatile. The hatchback body style provides considerably more cargo capacity than a typical midsize sedan, and the backseat offers plenty of space for passengers. Sadly, taller drivers still have to contend with a steering wheel that's placed too far away. Even though there's a telescoping column, it doesn't come out nearly far enough to enable a comfortable driving position. \nStandard equipment on the Prius Two includes 15-inch alloy wheels, heated power mirrors, a rear window wiper, keyless ignition/entry, cruise control, automatic climate control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split-folding rear seat, an advanced trip computer, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a 6.1-inch touchscreen display and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, an auxiliary audio jack and an iPod/USB audio interface.\nThe Prius Three gains an enhanced keyless entry system, a rearview camera, a navigation system, voice controls, satellite radio, HD radio and Toyota's Entune system, which includes real-time information (traffic, weather, fuel prices, sports scores) and the ability to use apps like Pandora, iHeart Radio and Open Table via a connection with your smartphone.\nStepping up to the Prius Four gets you automatic headlights, an eight-way power driver seat, heated front seats, SofTex (leatherette) upholstery, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and a JBL sound system with eight GreenEdge speakers.\nThe Prius Five features 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights and LED headlights.\nAn optional Solar Roof package for the Prius Three adds a sunroof and a solar-powered ventilation system that keeps the car cool to limit the burden on the air-conditioning system. It's also offered for the Four, and then includes a head-up display, Safety Connect emergency communications and an upgraded navigation system with a 7-inch high-definition display and split-screen capability.\nThe Five's Advanced Technology package adds adaptive cruise control, a pre-collision alert system, a lane-departure warning system, Safety Connect, a head-up display and the higher-quality navigation display.\nAvailable on all trims is the Plus Appearance package, which adds unique 17-inch alloy wheels and a seven-piece aerodynamic body kit. To this, the Plus Performance package (availability depends on trim level) adds a sport-tuned suspension and unique badging.",

    "full_description": "Crossover  SUVs are all the rage, but it's good to remember that the trusty minivan can  pretty much do the same jobs. And thanks to its boxy body style &mdash;  unstylish as it may be &mdash; the minivan can do a lot of them better. A  great example is the 2020 Toyota Sienna.  It  features flexible seating and cargo arrangements, Apple CarPlay and Amazon  Alexa connectivity, a responsive V6 engine and available all-wheel drive. On  top of that, it's sharper to drive and much easier to load with people and gear  than the typical three-row SUV. The  Sienna can be equipped in either a seven- or an eight-passenger configuration,  with power or manual third-row operation. The third row tumbles down into the  floor, while the second-row seats can be removed to make a vast cargo area. One  distinctive feature of the Sienna is a small jump seat that is located between  the second-row captain's chairs. It allows you to carry an additional passenger  in a pinch. When you don't need the middle seat, you can easily remove it and stow  it away, giving second-row passengers room to stretch out. Even  though the Sienna is one of the oldest minivans on the market, it still  impresses with its on-road comfort and flexible configurations. Toyota's Safety  Sense system, or TSS-P, also helps modernize the Sienna by providing front  collision mitigation, lane departure warning and other modern driver assist  features. You might like the Honda Odyssey more for its more modern interior  design or the Chrysler Pacifica for its available plug-in hybrid engine option,  but overall the Sienna is a solid all-around pick. The  Sienna comes in many configurations that should suit a variety of uses. But our  choice would be the SE. It comes  with essential minivan functions such as tri-zone climate control,  power-sliding doors and a Wi-Fi hotspot, and it adds extra touches such as  leather upholstery, sportier styling and a power liftgate. An important point  for some: The SE is also available with all-wheel drive. How does the Sienna drive? The Sienna keeps pace with the quickest minivans on the market, though sometimes the transmission leaves a little to be desired. There's enough power for your typical driving situations, and the V6 engine feels quite lively at full throttle. We clocked a 0-60 mph sprint of 7.8 seconds, which is respectably quick for a family hauler. However, the engine tends to surge when it's cold out, and the transmission can be reluctant to downshift on uphill grades. The Sienna exhibits noticeable body roll when you hustle it through turns. You'll need to slow down to keep your passengers happy. Note that we tested the Limited Premium; the Sienna SE, with its sport-tuned suspension, is more stable along twisty roads. Braking performance is adequate and benefits from the brakes' soft pedal and linear response that aid predictability. How comfortable is the Sienna? The seats are initially comfortable and supportive, but long stints reveal pressure points. Second-row passengers will enjoy kicking back and using the available integrated legrests. The ride is serene and plush and can only be disturbed when driving over sharp midcorner bumps. At highway speeds, significant road and wind noise threatens to disrupt the Sienna's otherwise docile demeanor.The three-zone automatic climate control system works well to keep the entire cabin at a pleasant temperature, but it's almost unbearably loud at higher fan speeds. Front passengers benefit from very effective seat heaters, and the driver can keep his or her mitts toasty with the steering wheel heater. How\u2019s the interior? The Sienna offers great visibility and, unsurprisingly for a minivan, excellent points of entry and exit for all seats, But third-row passengers may need help sliding the heavy second-row seat forward for access. There's a surprising lack of headroom in the second and third rows due to its tapered roofline, but otherwise legroom and shoulder room are good, even for adults.The poorly arranged controls are also troublesome. For example, when the front cupholders are out, the front-seat passenger will find it difficult to access the seat heater control, and the rear entertainment system is difficult to operate. How\u2019s the tech? The user interface is intuitive, even though the touchscreen itself is rather unappealing because of low-resolution graphics. Recent device integration upgrades, such as Apple CarPlay, have brought the Sienna up to par with competitive vans. But Android Auto is still not offered.Along with adaptive cruise control, Toyota Safety Sense also includes pedestrian detection, lane keeping assist and automatic high beams. Be forewarned: The Sienna's adaptive cruise control does not feature stop-and-go capability and will shut off once the car drops below 25 mph. How\u2019s the storage? Excellent cargo volume sets the Sienna apart from the pack, and its flat load floor and low cargo liftover height make it one of the easiest to use, too. We also like the abundance of cupholders, deep storage bins, the push-button operation for the liftgate, and power-sliding side doors. If only the second-row seats weren't so heavy and hard to slide on their tracks, the Sienna would rate even higher.Thanks to the second row's sliding capability, child seats don't have to be removed for access to the third row. But you'll have to dig into the upholstery to gain access to the lower car seat anchors, and the upper tether is somewhat hidden at the base of the seatback. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA rates the front-wheel-drive Sienna at 22 mpg combined (19 city/27 highway), nearly identical to the Pacifica and the Odyssey (all three rate significantly higher than the Sedona). We validated these estimates on our 115-mile test loop, where the Sienna averaged 24.2 mpg. Is the Sienna a good value? The Limited Premium isn't as luxurious as similar rivals, but it is more expensive. Our tester exhibited rattles and a buzzy speaker in the liftgate, which doesn't bode well for a car with fewer than 10,000 miles. Warranty and roadside assistance coverage are fairly standard across the segment. Toyota offers complimentary maintenance, but that's just two oil changes and inspections. Roadside assistance is free for two years and unlimited miles. The Sienna is a mostly competent minivan that'll do everything you expect a minivan to do. It doesn't stand out in any one area, making its competitive advantage hard to decipher, but it's perfectly serviceable in its role as people hauler and cargo carrier. Passengers will find the experience comfortable, provided third-row occupants aren't too tall, and the driver will appreciate the sometimes-punchy V6.",

    "full_description": "For 2017, the Toyota Camry's top trim levels get more standard features that include an upgraded infotainment system and a wireless device-charging pad. The 2017 Toyota Camry fulfills all of the  expectations placed on midsize sedans, which is likely why it's been such a  huge sales success. With an emphasis on comfort and ease of use, combined with  a solid reputation for durability and reliability, it's easy to see why. Some  rival sedans might be a little flashier or sportier, but the Camry remains an  honest and worthy pick.  For 2017, the Camry soldiers on mostly unchanged.  You have four trim levels ranging from basic to sporty or more luxurious, and  two engine choices: an adequate four-cylinder or a potent V6. The top two trims  are eligible for the V6 as well as some optional advanced safety features,  which is one of the reasons we recommend upgrading to these levels. There's of course no shortage of competition for the  2017 Toyota Camry, and you'd do well to check them out. Each represents a  slightly different take on the midsize sedan, emphasizing a different brand of  performance, value and personality. Deciding between them may very well come  down to an intangible preference, but almost all of them will satisfy your core  needs. The 2017 Toyota Camry meets the expectations placed on midsize sedans with an emphasis on comfort and ease of use, combined with a solid reputation for durability and reliability. Some rival sedans might be a little flashier or sportier, but the Camry remains an honest and worthy pick. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2015 Toyota Camry XLE (3.5L V6; 6-speed  automatic). NOTE: Since this test was conducted, the current Camry has received  only minor revisions. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's  Camry. The Camry V6 is plenty strong in a straight line, posting a 6.2-second dash to 60 mph. This sedan accelerates effortlessly with this engine combined with a smooth, manually shiftable six-speed automatic. Though the 129 feet it took for the Camry to stop from 60 mph at our test track is on the long side for the class, pedal feel was very good with intuitive around-town operation. We also noted good resistance to pedal fade even with repeated use. We still wouldn't say the Camry's steering gives a great feel of the road, but it has some life to it and provides more feedback than previous generations. This is an easy car to steer, and you can place it in corners with confidence. Even if ultimate tire grip is modest, the Camry's poise and ability to go from corner to corner with confidence are good for this class. The electronic stability control system is effective and unobtrusive when it's needed and engaged. With its effortless acceleration, intuitive brake response, confident handling and excellent highway manners, the Camry is easy to drive on all manner of roads. Light steering and a manageable size make it easy to park as well. The XLE's heated leather front seats offer good comfort and adequate support. The rear seat can actually accommodate three across, thanks to exceptionally generous proportions and good contours. One of the Camry's best qualities is its plush and sophisticated ride. It's able to soak up small bumps without a fuss and without the secondary body motions that plague some cars in this class. With excellent isolation from road, engine and wind noise, the Camry is among the quietest cars in its class. Whether idling, accelerating at full-throttle up to speed or just cruising on the highway, only true luxury cars are quieter. Large buttons and knobs dominate common functions (audio, climate control), and the XLE's standard 7-inch touchscreen has large icons and responds quickly. The doors are large yet light, and reasonable seat and doorsill heights make for easy access. The rear headliner-mounted grab handles further aid exit when faced with tight parking situations. The Camry is within fractions of an inch in terms of interior space/room versus its closest rivals, with a few measurements exceeding theirs. It might be classified as a midsize car, but the Camry looks and feels larger inside. The thin windshield pillars and low side glass give an airy feeling. The rear view is aided by a large, standard backup camera. The shape of the hood can make it difficult to gauge the front corners, though, and blind-spot monitoring and lane departure warning are optional. Among its peers, the Camry has better than average build quality, with tight seams, solid-closing doors, good paint, and not a single misaligned or squeaky panel inside. It feels more substantial than most at this price. There are plenty of places to store your personal items thanks to the Camry's large door pockets with bottleholders, a generous glovebox, a deep console bin and numerous cubbies (one with a wireless charging pad). The Camry's 15.4-cubic-foot trunk is about average for the class, but it gets points for having a wide and low opening and remote releases for the 60/40-split folding rear seats. A rear-facing child seat will fit in back with ease, but the fixed rear headrests make it difficult to properly secure a front-facing child seat. The infotainment screen isn't as sharp or modern as other systems, but navigation input is reasonably easy. The menu structure is intuitive, and operation is as easy as that of competitors. Voice recognition is accurate, rarely requiring you to repeat commands. Return prompts from the system offer helpful assistance, too. The 2017 Toyota Camry, in XSE trim, represents an agreeable  middle ground between the base LE and top-of-the-line XLE, both in terms of  price and feature content. We recommend it over the SE trim because it is  eligible for the optional Technology package and its advanced safety features. If you can't decide on an engine, the standard  four-cylinder will be adequate for the majority of drivers. We like the  optional V6's more confident acceleration, but the price premium may be a deal-breaker.  Standard  feature highlights for the base LE trim include 16-inch steel wheels, automatic headlights, heated mirrors, a  sunroof, keyless remote entry, power front seats, 60/40-split folding rear  seats, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, a 6.1-inch Entune touchscreen interface  and a six-speaker sound system. The SE adds 17-inch alloy wheels, a  sport-tuned suspension, paddle shifters, upgraded cloth and simulated-leather  upholstery, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.  We like  what you get with the XSE, though.  It steps up with 18-inch wheels, LED running lights, dual-zone automatic  climate control, leather and simulated-suede upholstery, a wireless charging  pad, an upgraded Entune system with 7-inch display, a smartphone app-based  navigation system and a 10-speaker premium audio system with satellite and HD  radio. V6 models also get LED headlights, a sunroof, a noise-reducing  windshield and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.  The  range-topping XLE trim tops it off  with 17-inch wheels, leather upholstery and heated front seats. V6 models add  keyless entry and ignition. Many of  these features are available on supporting trims as options. An integrated  navigation system is also offered on all models. Additionally, the Technology  package for the XSE trim adds adaptive  cruise control, forward collision warning and mitigation, lane departure  warning, blind-spot monitoring with rear  cross-traffic alert, and automatic high beams. Adding this package to the XLE  trim also includes Toyota's Safety Connect emergency telematics features.",

    "full_description": "For 2017, the Toyota Sienna receives an upgraded V6 engine and new eight-speed transmission. The rest of its features and options carry over unchanged. For sensible family transportation, it's still hard to beat  a minivan. Sliding side doors, a low step-in height, and massive passenger and  cargo space make the average minivan a more practical alternative to most large  SUVs and crossovers. Although it was last redesigned in 2010, the Toyota Sienna  is still a top choice in the class. With seating for eight and class-exclusive  all-wheel drive, the Sienna holds its own against other top-rated minivans such  as the Honda Odyssey and Kia Sedona.  \nToyota did a minor face-lift of the Sienna in 2015,  improving the interior layout and the quality of materials and fabrics.  Commonly used controls and the touchscreen technology interface were oriented  closer to the driver, and the upholstery and trim finally felt worthy of the  Sienna's asking price. \nFor 2017, the Sienna gets two notable enhancements: an  updated V6 engine and a new eight-speed transmission that together give the  Sienna improved mileage and performance.\u00a0 \nWhen it comes to the competition, several alternatives are  worth considering. The Honda Odyssey is the most direct rival, with  similar pricing and some exclusive features. The Kia  Sedona is not only a top value; it also gives up little to the Honda  and Toyota in terms of features. The Chrysler Pacifica is a worthy new entrant, an  overdue replacement for the Town & Country (and related Dodge Caravan). Its  roominess and smart storage rival that of the Odyssey, and perhaps more  important, it's also available as a hybrid. Finally, if you can make do with  seven seats, consider the funky and efficient Nissan  Quest.  Antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control,  front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, a driver-side knee  airbag, a front-passenger seat cushion airbag, active front head restraints and  a rearview camera are standard on all 2017 Toyota Sienna models. \nBlind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and front  and rear parking sensors are available depending on the trim level. The Limited  can be had with a forward collision warning system. \nAt our test track, a Sienna Limited stopped from 60 mph in  126 feet, an average distance for a minivan. \nIn government crash tests, the 2017 Toyota Sienna received a five-star rating for overall performance, with  four stars for total front-crash protection and five stars for total side-crash  protection. In tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Sienna  earned a top score of Good for its performance in the  moderate-overlap front-impact, side-impact, roof strength and head restraint  (whiplash protection) tests. It received the second-highest rating of  Acceptable in the IIHS test for small-overlap front-impact protection.Notably, we picked the 2017 Toyota Sienna as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars, Trucks and SUVs. We've long been impressed by the Sienna's V6 engine and how  it delivers lively acceleration around town or getting up to cruising speed on  the highway. The V6's upgrades for 2017 bring a healthy increase in performance  along with mildly improved fuel mileage.\nAll trim levels offer competent handling that most  passengers will find agreeable. Still, the SE's firmer suspension (a relative  term) provides more confidence around turns and greater body control over big  bumps and undulations without giving up an appreciable amount of comfort. The  marginally heavier steering is also more natural than the slightly numb feel on  other trim levels. If you're accustomed to driving a car, the SE should make  the switch to a minivan a bit easier.  Lower trim levels of the Sienna are attractively decked out  with high-quality fabric upholstery, while higher-end models get leather along  with simulated wood cabin accents. Materials quality is very good, and the dash  design is modern and attractive. Seating is plush, and there's abundant storage  space along with user-friendly controls. \nOn the electronics front, every Sienna comes with a  touchscreen interface. Both available screens feature a similar  easy-to-decipher menu structure with surrounding buttons that require little  effort to jump from one main function to another, including the built-in  navigation system or a suite of smartphone-connected services. There's also an  available rear-seat entertainment system, which features a split-screen monitor  that allows two different media (a movie on one side and a video game on the  other, for example) to play simultaneously, thereby making it easier to quash  at least one potential sibling argument. \nThe eight-passenger Sienna comes with a 40/20/20-split  second-row bench with a sliding center section that slides forward to improve  access for a child safety seat. It can also be removed and stowed within the  van itself (unlike the Odyssey's, where you must find a place for it  elsewhere). \nWith a seven-passenger Sienna, you get second-row captain's  chairs. Although their available extendable footrests will likely catch your  eye during a test drive, you'll also likely be impressed by their ability to  slide much farther fore or aft than those of most competitors, increasing  sprawl-out comfort. Maximum cargo space is 150 cubic feet, though to achieve  this you have to take out the second-row seats, which are quite heavy and  awkward to remove.\n \nThe Sienna L includes 17-inch alloy wheels, a windshield  wiper de-icer, manual sliding rear doors, automatic headlights, cruise control,  tri-zone automatic climate control, a height-adjustable driver seat, cloth  upholstery, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a rearview camera, Bluetooth  phone and audio connectivity, Siri Eyes Free functionality for iPhone users,  and a four-speaker sound system with a 6.1-inch touchscreen, CD player, USB  port, media player interface and an auxiliary audio jack. \nThe LE adds roof rails, power-sliding rear doors, privacy  glass, heated mirrors, body-color exterior trim (replacing black plastic),  floor- and overhead-mounted consoles, a conversation mirror, an eight-way power  driver seat (with power lumbar support), upgraded \"easy-clean\" fabric  upholstery, second- and third-row sunshades, a 7-inch touchscreen,  compatibility with the Scout GPS Link app, and a six-speaker sound system with  HD and satellite radio. All-wheel-drive versions get 18-inch wheels. \nThe SE is equipped similarly to the LE but adds a  sport-tuned suspension, sharper steering, 19-inch alloy wheels, a unique front  fascia (foglights, LED daytime running lights and mesh grille) and lower-body  skirting. The SE also has a power liftgate, first- and second-row perforated  leather upholstery (row three gets premium vinyl), heated front seats, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel and unique gauges with a larger driver  information screen. \nThe SE Premium adds a sunroof, keyless ignition and entry,  blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems, a navigation  system, Entune smartphone app integration, a rear-seat entertainment system  (with HDMI and SD card inputs, a Blu-ray/DVD player, two 120-volt power  outlets, and a large screen that can be split to display two different sources)  and the Driver Easy Speak system, which amplifies the driver's voice through  the rear speakers. A sunroof can be added separately. \nThe Sienna XLE shares many of the SE trim's comfort and  convenience equipment, but it features similar suspension, steering and styling  to the LE. It also adds a four-way power front-passenger seat, imitation-wood  trim, power-opening rear quarter windows, and keyless ignition and entry. The  XLE Premium adds the SE Premium's features and rear parking sensors. The XLE  Navigation package includes the same items minus the rear entertainment system  and blind-spot monitoring/cross-traffic alert.\nThe plush Limited includes the XLE Premium's features (minus  the rear entertainment system), along with 18-inch alloy wheels, a different  grille, LED daytime running lights, auto-dimming and power-folding mirrors,  front and rear sunroofs, front and rear parking sensors, first- and second-row  premium leather upholstery, driver memory settings, a heated steering wheel,  Toyota Safety Connect emergency services, a navigation system and an upgraded  10-speaker JBL surround-sound audio system. Front-wheel-drive models also get a  sliding center console between the first two rows, extendable footrests for the  second row and a power-folding third row with imitation leather upholstery. \nYou can add even more with the Limited Premium model that  adds xenon headlights, automatic high beams, automatic wipers, the rear-seat  entertainment system and upgraded leather for the third row (AWD only). \nFor the front-wheel-drive Sienna Limited only, an Advanced  Technology package adds adaptive cruise control and a forward collision warning  system.  The Toyota Sienna comes with a 3.5-liter V6 engine that has  been upgraded for 2017 and now packs 296 horsepower and 263 pound-feet of  torque. An eight-speed automatic transmission also replaces the previous  six-speed. Front-wheel drive is standard on all models; the LE, XLE and Limited  models offer the option of all-wheel drive. \nThe  upgrades to the engine and transmission slightly improved EPA fuel economy  estimates. Front-wheel-drive Sienna models are rated at 22 mpg combined (19  city/27 highway), and all-wheel-drive models are rated at 20 mpg combined (18  city/24 highway). ",

The wealth of available configurations means there's likely a Tacoma  that fits your needs, and some of them provide an impressive degree of  trail-busting capability. Alongside those specialized off-road  Tacomas with their knobby tires, upgraded suspension and off-road driving aids,  there are street-oriented versions of the Tacoma, too. Notably, even the more  luxurious trim levels share their siblings' lifted stance. It creates a high  step-in height and a slightly unusual seating position, but it also means every  Tacoma is at least a little adventure-ready.The Tacoma has some notable competition.  The Honda Ridgeline lacks the Tacoma's rugged look, but it offers all the  practicality of a pickup plus innovative storage options, a more carlike ride  quality and a roomier interior. There's also the Chevrolet Colorado, which  feels like a slightly scaled-down Chevy Silverado full-size truck in many  respects and has a superior engine lineup. Overall, though, we think the Tacoma  hits the spot for what most midsize pickup shoppers are looking for.Notably, we picked the 2018 Toyota Tacoma as one of Edmunds' Best Midsize Trucks for this year for 2018.\nWhat's it like to live with?\nWant to know what it's like to live with a Toyota Tacoma  long term? We did too. So we purchased a 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off Road and  lived with it for nearly two years, putting 40,155 miles on the odometer. The  2018 Tacoma has received some updates, with some additional trim levels and  standard safety features such as forward collision warning and lane departure  alert, but it's the same generation truck, so most of our observations still  apply. To learn more about the Toyota Tacoma, check out all the details in our long-term test, where we cover everything from  seat comfort to real-world fuel economy. The Tacoma is Toyota's go-anywhere midsize pickup truck, living up to a legacy of tough and rugged small trucks that have thrived in every inhospitable environment on Earth. This Tacoma's well-mannered chassis and user-friendly interior make it a good daily driver, while its baked-in ground clearance and optional off-road equipment make it a go-to for backcountry adventures. Each vehicle typically  comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based  on our full test of the 2016 Toyota  Tacoma TRD Off-Road Crew Cab (3.5L V6 | 6-speed automatic | 4WD).NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Toyota Tacoma has received some  minor equipment revisions. Our findings are broadly applicable to this year's  Toyota Tacoma, however. The 3.5-liter V6 is preferable to the four-cylinder, but it is otherwise unremarkable. Our test truck accelerated to 60 mph in 8.1 seconds, which is adequate for its intended mission but not class-leading. Low-rpm power is unimpressive. Dependable stops are straight and true. In a panic the Tacoma will stop from 60 mph in 124 feet, which is good considering the soft off-road tires. But in typical driving, the brakes tend toward touchy and overeager, making it hard to execute smooth stops. The Tacoma's steering always comes across as predictable and reassuring, with smooth and progressive effort as you guide it through corners. And it feels steady and connected when cruising straight, too. The chunky leather-wrapped steering wheel feels solid in your hands. Body roll is gradual and restrained, and the Tacoma imparts a good sense of overall competence and coordination on the sorts of winding roads you inevitably need to traverse on the way to the campground, ski lodge or trailhead. It feels equally secure and sure-footed out on the trail, too. The six-speed automatic shifts smoothly, but fuel-efficiency-biased programming makes it reluctant to downshift. There is an ECT Power button that alters the shift points for more immediate response, but it must be reselected every time you restart the truck. A six-speed manual is available. All 4WD versions of the Tacoma do very well, but the TRD Off-Road has the suspension, tires and abundant clearance to go places other pickups, including other volume-selling midsize truck models, cannot. The locking differential, terrain select and crawl control systems are real advantages. The seats feel comfortable and supportive even though their adjustments are quite simple. Very tall drivers might wish for more thigh support because of the unusual driving position. The ride is notably smoother and less busy than in past Tacomas. Bilstein shocks and tall sidewalls of the 16-inch tires are adept at filtering out small road flaws, better in some circumstances than the Limited's 18-inch tires. Still, any blindfolded passenger will know this is a pickup. The cabin is average for wind and road noise at highway speeds. Mechanical engine noise is nicely muted. It's not hushed like a sedan, but it's nevertheless a pleasant place to pass the miles. The standard system is very straightforward and easy to operate, with prominent controls that need no explanation. The airflow is good through the nice-size vents. An automatic climate control system is available as an option. All switchgear is exceptionally easy to reach, understand and use, and that includes the automatic climate control, the 4WD selector switch, the crawl control system and the multiterrain selector. The Tacoma has a high cabin floor that is an outgrowth of its off-road design philosophy, which demands generous ground clearance. This makes step-in notably higher than in trucks such as the Colorado and Ridgeline. The Tacoma's high floor produces a legs-out driving posture that's more like being in a car than you'd expect. Taller drivers tend to notice this because the telescoping steering wheel doesn't have enough adjustment range, forcing them to scoot closer with knees bent more than they would otherwise. There's plenty of personal space in the Tacoma, but the front headroom isn't generous. You've got to be taller than average to notice, and if that is the case you might want to think twice about that sunroof. The crew cab's back seat isn't as roomy as rivals'. There's a clear view out in all directions, and the high seating position makes it easy to spot the front corners. The crew cab's rear windows are large, and the mirrors are a good size. The standard backup camera is a further plus. The attractive interior features solid materials and construction. Numerous trips off-road failed to reveal any squeaks or rattles. Four cupholders reside between the front seats, and they can also hold small items. The shelf ahead of them is meant for phones, and in some trims it's a wireless charging pad. Glovebox, center console box and door pockets are decent-size. The rear seatbacks fold forward to reveal concealed bins. The crew cab's rear seats fold to create a flat platform that can hold more cargo than a Colorado. Standard composite bed needs no bedliner and has rails with movable tie-down cleats, a power outlet, LED lighting and storage bins. Removable tailgate is damped so it won't slam when dropped open. The crew cab has two pairs of LATCH lower anchors and a trio of upper tethers. The former are recessed between the cushions, and the latter must be accessed by folding the rear seatback forward, which is a bit of a pain. Bulky rear-facing seats force the corresponding front seat to be slid forward. A 4WD V6 Tacoma can tow as much as 6,800 pounds, which is a solid number for a midsize truck. The standard tow package includes hitch, wiring, extra cooling, a bigger alternator and trailer sway control. The touchscreen audio and navigation system is easier to use than many competing systems because it has simple volume and tune knobs (though they could be larger). The graphics are clear, and there isn't much glare. Sound quality is respectable from the base sound system. Bluetooth pairing is simple, but the USB-based smartphone interface requires you to install the Entune app on your phone to use some features. But the app is clunky to use and locks the phone for other purposes \u2014 even if it's the passenger's phone. The cabin contains just one USB jack. Models equipped with the touchscreen audio system such as our TRD Off-Road include navigation, phone and audio voice controls that do a reasonable job. Those with a paired Apple iPhone can press and hold the voice button longer to engage certain commands using the more sophisticated Siri interface. If we were putting down our own money for an off-road-capable small truck, we'd opt for the TRD Off-Road V6 4WD. It provides an impressive amount of capability without the sticker shock. The cabin is equipped with enough creature comforts (heated seats, a 7-inch touchscreen, wireless smartphone charging, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and a sunroof) to make it an acceptable companion for a daily commute. Bare-bones isn't quite the right way to  describe the low-dollar SR, the most  modestly equipped Tacoma of the lot. Even so, it can be had with an extended  cab with a 6.1-foot bed or a crew cab with a 5-foot bed, and you can choose  between two-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive with a low-range transfer  case. Its 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine with 159 horsepower is paired to a  six-speed automatic transmission. For 2018, all trim levels including the SR  gain forward collision  warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure alert, automatic high  beams, and adaptive cruise control as standard equipment. The SR is most easily identified by its  dark grille and 16-inch steel wheels. But even this basic Tacoma comes with a  sliding rear window, a tough composite bed that needs no bedliner, a movable  cleat tie-down system, and a backup camera fitted in the tailgate release  handle. Inside, the four-way-adjustable cloth seats have driver-side lumbar  adjustment, and the steering wheel tilts, telescopes, and has control buttons  that work with the basic Entune stereo, which supports Bluetooth and has a USB  interface. For most buyers, the SR5 is the better deal. In addition to the previous configurations  mentioned, you can also get a long-wheelbase version that pairs the crew cab  with the 6.1-foot bed. Outwardly, the SR5 gains a chrome rear bumper and a  flash of chrome on its charcoal-colored grille. It's got foglights set into its  front bumper, and the 16-inch steel wheels can be upgraded to alloys. Remote  keyless entry becomes standard, its steering wheel is wrapped in leather, and  the sliding rear window uses privacy glass. There's a 4.2-inch information  screen between the gauges, and the enhanced Entune audio system supports  satellite radio, smartphone-enabled navigation via the Scout GPS app, and Siri  Eyes Free voice control.Next up is the TRD Sport. It is offered in the same cab and bed configurations as  the SR5, but it replaces the four-cylinder engine with a 278-hp 3.5-liter V6.  All rear-wheel-drive versions use the six-speed automatic, but four-wheel-drive  buyers can choose between the automatic and a performance-oriented six-speed  manual. It comes with 17-inch alloy wheels,  body-colored fender flares and rear bumper, turn signals in the mirror housings  and, everyone's favorite, a hood scoop. There's a 400-watt power outlet in the  bed, and the crew cab's sliding rear window is power-actuated. Automatic  transmission-equipped trucks gain smart entry and push-button start, and all  TRD Sports make the jump to full navigation via the Entune premium audio  system's 7-inch touchscreen.The TRD  Off-Road offers the same configuration and engine options as the TRD Sport,  and its truck bed and interior and audio trimmings are identical. Visual  differences include a chrome rear bumper, textured black fender flares and the  absence of the Sport's hood scoop. Off-road performance changes loom large in  this trim, and these include knobby all-terrain tires on 16-inch alloy wheels, the  deletion of the front air dam, extra skid plates, a lockable rear differential,  Bilstein monotube shocks, and an advanced off-road traction control system with  multiple terrain settings and crawl control.Both the TRD Sport and TRD Off-Road  crew-cab models can be upgraded with a few option packages. Feature highlights  include a sunroof, parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring with rear  cross-traffic alert, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated seats, leather  upholstery, and a JBL speaker upgrade and a subwoofer. It's worth noting that  the stereo upgrade is not available on models with the manual transmission.The Limited is the most civilized version of the Tacoma. It is only offered as a V6-powered  crew cab with the short bed in either two- or four-wheel drive. It has  body-colored flares and rear bumper, and it rolls on 18-inch wheels with  lower-profile tires. It lacks the TRD Off-Road's specialized off-road upgrades  and is instead upgraded with just about all of the Off-Road and Sport's  optional features as standard equipment. The TRD  Pro is sold only as a crew cab with a short bed, and it comes only in  four-wheel drive. The V6 engine is standard, but you can choose between the  manual and the automatic transmission. It's equipped like a loaded-up TRD  Off-Road but sets itself apart with special styling details, including a black  throwback grille with \"Toyota\" spelled out in capital letters. Most  notably, it has special Fox internal bypass shocks that give it more off-road  capability as well as a tougher stance that's an inch broader and an inch  taller.",

    "full_description": "The 2014 Toyota Corolla is fully redesigned. The redesigned 2014 Toyota Corolla looks to regain stature in the compact sedan class. Crisper styling, better fuel economy, more rear-seat room and a highly functional interior design should help it remain a big seller. Without a doubt, the biggest and most significant new Toyota this year is the 2014 Toyota Corolla. Although it was always a strong seller, the previous-generation Corolla was outclassed by more stylish, more fuel-efficient and better-performing rivals in the compact sedan segment. The upshot is that it has been many years since the Corolla was a no-brainer pick for a small, affordably priced sedan.\nSlightly longer, lower and wider than last year's model, the 2014 Corolla has a more aggressive-looking exterior. The exaggerated front-end design will likely polarize consumers (those who care about styling anyway), but at least it's edgier and more interesting than the forgettable forms of the past. In addition, all 2014 Toyota Corollas come standard with LED low-beam headlights, an unexpected feature in this segment.\nIf you're expecting an exciting driving experience to accompany this extroverted styling, you're probably going to be disappointed. Toyota kept the Corolla's easygoing personality intact. But the new Corolla does offer decent performance, a comfortable ride, good gas mileage, user-friendly features and solid reliability, all things that have made it so popular through the decades.\nOne key improvement this year is fuel economy. Any Corolla you look at will sip less gas than last year thanks to a variety of tweaks and a new continuously variable transmission (CVT), which takes the place of a conventional automatic transmission on some versions. Also, there's a new fuel economy-themed trim level called the LE Eco. Equipped with a revised version of the standard Corolla's 1.8-liter engine, the Corolla LE Eco earns best-in-class mpg numbers (for gasoline-fueled, automatic transmission-equipped compacts), achieving an EPA combined rating of 35 mpg along with a highway rating of 42 mpg.\nAnother functional upgrade on the 2014 Corolla is roomier seating. Rear passengers, in particular, enjoy nearly 5 inches more rear legroom, which will also make it easier to fit rear-facing child safety seats. Toyota has also restyled the instrument panel to impart a more contemporary feel. The company also used higher-quality interior materials and added a few new features, including keyless ignition/entry. \nAlthough the 2014 Toyota Corolla is significantly better than the outgoing model, it isn't a slam dunk, as the small sedan segment has plenty of strong choices. The Corolla's perennial archrival, the Honda Civic, has rebounded from its own design missteps to lead this class, while the Mazda 3 and Ford Focus remain well-stocked drivers' favorites. Nor can the nicely equipped Hyundai Elantra and Kia Forte be ignored. That said, the Corolla is far more competitive than before, and this should bolster its already strong sales.  Every 2014 Toyota Corolla is powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. On every model except the LE Eco, it produces 132 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque. For the LE Eco, an enhanced, more efficient version of this engine is used; it's rated at 140 hp and 126 lb-ft of torque.\nA six-speed manual transmission is standard on the L and S trims. Optional on the L is a four-speed automatic transmission, while a CVT is optional on the S and standard on the LE and LE Eco. When equipped with the CVT, the S model features steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters as well as a Sport mode that sharpens transmission and steering response.\nEPA-estimated fuel economy is 31 mpg combined (28 mpg city/37 mpg highway) with the six-speed manual and 31 mpg combined (27 mpg city/36 mpg highway) with the L's four-speed automatic. With the CVT, you'll get a slightly better 32 mpg combined (29 mpg city/38 mpg highway for the LE, 29/37 for the S). Finally, the LE Eco, thanks to its special engine and fuel efficiency tweaks, earns an estimated 35 mpg combined (30 mpg city/42 mpg highway). Standard Toyota Corolla safety features include stability and traction control, antilock brakes (front discs/rear drums for all, rear discs available on the S trim), front side airbags, side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag and a passenger seat cushion airbag. A rearview camera is standard on all versions except the base L.\nIn government crash tests, the 2014 Toyota Corolla earned a rating of five stars overall, with five stars in frontal and side crash tests and four stars in rollover testing. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the 2014 Toyota Corolla a rating of \"Good\" in moderate overlap front crash tests, side and roof strength tests and head and seat restraints, with a moderate rating in small overlap front tests. We've only had a short amount of time behind the wheel of  the 2014 Toyota Corolla. So far, the Corolla has struck us as an agreeable, if  uninspired, small sedan to drive. The new CVT works well by the standards of  CVTs. There's some drone during acceleration, but it's not particularly  irritating. Ultimately, the latest Corolla drives much like the previous one.  That means the steering is precise but rather numb (and not the least bit  sporty), while the suspension provides a comfortable ride, though you'd never  describe it as luxurious or coddling. Similarly, the four-cylinder engine tries  hard but begins to feel winded during aggressive passing maneuvers or when  climbing mountain grades.\nThe best thing about the new Toyota Corolla is that it never  feels as if it's straining to keep up with traffic or unable to deal with the  unexpected. In place of inspiring performance, the redesigned Corolla offers  unpretentiousness that expresses itself as character, and that coupled with its  legendary reputation for reliability should ensure that the latest version of  Toyota's compact sedan finds a home in plenty of garages. The 2014 Corolla's cabin is not exactly exciting, but controls are easy to find and use. The radio features tried-and-true volume and tuning knobs, for example, while the climate control has large knobs and buttons. The upgraded audio system and navigation systems boast a touchscreen with similarly large virtual buttons and simple, clear graphics. Materials quality is average, and overall, the interior of the Corolla doesn't look or feel as expensive as the cabins of the Ford Focus and Kia Forte. \nThe Corolla's optional suite of smartphone-connected services includes the Bing search engine, Pandora streaming radio, traffic data, and sports and stock information. Getting started with Entune can be a hassle, though, since you have to install an app on your phone and register for an account; plus, you always need an active data connection to use Entune. The touchscreen interface has straightforward menus, but it's sometimes unresponsive to user touch.\nAs with most Toyotas, the front seats are soft and comfy, while those in the S version are firmer and have more pronounced side bolsters. There is plenty of space here, even for taller drivers, and the backseat also boasts impressive space. Indeed, at 41.4 inches, rear legroom bests that of most midsize sedans. \nThe Corolla's trunk capacity is average at 13 cubic feet, but the wide opening eases loading and unloading. If more space is needed, the rear seat splits and folds to increase capacity.  \nStandard features on the base L model include 15-inch steel wheels, LED headlights (low beams only), power windows and mirrors, air-conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split-folding rear seat, Bluetooth phone connectivity, steering wheel audio controls and a four-speaker sound system with a CD player, a USB/iPod interface and an auxiliary audio jack.\nThe LE adds 16-inch steel wheels, heated mirrors, variable intermittent wipers, keyless entry, metallic cabin accents, cruise control, power door locks, automatic climate control, a rearview camera, a six-speaker sound system with a 6-inch touchscreen display, and Bluetooth audio connectivity and phonebook download capability. The LE Plus adds alloy wheels and foglights, while the LE Premium further adds premium vinyl upholstery.\nThe LE Eco includes the LE features and adds specific engine and transmission tuning, low-rolling-resistance tires, a rear spoiler and enhanced aerodynamics. The LE Eco Plus adds alloy wheels, foglights, chrome beltline trim and an Eco driving mode, while the LE Eco Premium adds premium vinyl upholstery.\nThe S includes the LE features and adds a chrome grille frame, foglights, color-keyed mirrors with signal repeaters, a rear spoiler, front sport seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, upgraded instrumentation, a trip computer and piano black accents. The S Plus adds 17-inch alloy wheels, firmer suspension tuning and rear disc brakes, while the S Premium gets premium vinyl upholstery.\nKey options for the Plus and Premium trims include a sunroof and a Driver Convenience package that includes keyless ignition/entry, smartphone app integration, satellite radio, HD radio and a navigation system.",

    "full_description": "Redesigned  for 2019, the Toyota RAV4 receives a variety of updates, including a stylish  new look, a new engine, and added safety and technology features. No doubt they  will contribute to the RAV4's status as the best-selling small crossover SUV on  the market. But is it the ideal pick for you? The  2019 RAV4 gets a 2.5-liter engine that produces 203 horsepower, which is 27 hp  more than last year's model. And it's not just more powerful, it's more  efficient, too. The new engine, plus a new eight-speed automatic transmission  and a lighter curb weight compared to last year, help the new RAV4 get an  EPA-estimated 30 mpg combined (26 city/35 highway), which makes it one of the  most fuel-efficient crossovers available. Inside,  the RAV4 is comfortable and spacious. The controls are easy to find and,  depending on the trim level you select, there are nice surfaces lining the  cabin. Apple CarPlay comes standard on every RAV4, as does Toyota's Safety  Sense Suite 2.0, which includes adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist,  and forward collision mitigation with automatic braking. On a lot of other  SUVs, you have to upgrade to the more expensive trim levels to get these safety  features. Toyota  is still offering an Adventure trim level this year. Notably, it gets some  styling cues to make it look a little more like Toyota's trucks plus a special  all-wheel-drive system that can provide extra traction. Then you have all of  the traditional RAV4 strengths. It has excellent cargo space, a big back seat,  and a comfortable ride on the highway. In short, the new RAV4 has gotten  significantly better without losing any of the versatility that has made it so  popular in the past.There  are some minor drawbacks. Even with the new engine, acceleration isn't exactly  thrilling, and Toyota doesn't offer any engine upgrades. And while the updated  infotainment interface is a significant improvement compared to last year, it  can be difficult to learn and use. If these are deal-breakers for you, you  should take a look at the impressively well-rounded Honda CR-V or the stylish  Mazda CX-5. Overall, however, we think just about every small SUV shopper  should take a look at the redesigned 2019 Toyota RAV4.  Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the Toyota RAV4  Adventure (2.5L 4-cyl | 8-speed automatic | AWD). The engine feels willing around town, and passing and merging are pretty much drama-free. But if you're in a huge rush, you might notice the engine's ultimately modest power delivery. In Edmunds testing, our RAV4 test vehicle needed 9.1 seconds to cover 0-60 mph, which is slightly slower than the class average. It's easy to make smooth and steady stops in traffic, and the pedal conveys a sense of reassuring effectiveness without being jumpy. The RAV4 is also stable and secure during hard stops. In our panic-braking test, the RAV4 took 126 feet to stop from 60 mph, which is an average distance for a small crossover SUV. The steering is indistinct and vague at the center point, and effort is a bit too light. And though it firms as you turn it away from the center and into corners, the amount doesn't match how hard the tires are working, so it's easy to misjudge your level of input. More positively, the RAV4 tracks well on the highway, and it's fairly resistant to crosswinds. The RAV4 is coordinated and balanced, and it doesn't lean too much when negotiating corners. It's nicely resistant to bumps that come in the middle of corners, too. Torque-vectoring all-wheel drive helps turn this SUV more steadily in wet or snowy conditions. Tire grip is appropriate for the class. The eight-speed transmission has enough ratios to avoid busy shifting on grades. Shifts are very smooth, and there's no reluctance to downshift, but the shift-smoothing strategy does make each shift take longer than you might want if you're in a rush. The Sport mode sharpens gas-pedal responsiveness and shift timing to a useful degree. The Adventure and the Limited have an upgraded AWD system with rear-axle torque vectoring. They also have more advanced traction control systems that support a driver-selectable system of multiple terrain settings and hill descent control. These systems, plus respectable ground clearance, give the RAV4 Adventure above-average off-road ability for a small SUV. The front seats are nicely sculpted and padded appropriately, but the seat bottoms begin to feel flat on longer drives. The passenger side's lack of seat height adjustment and coarse-adjusting manual backrest lever make it difficult to find a comfortable position. The rear seatbacks recline, and the seat bottoms and backrest are comfortably shaped and nicely padded. The suspension is tuned to strike a good balance between control and softness. The body doesn't bound or float, and small to moderate impacts are absorbed without much drama. Deep potholes can feel sharp, but the overall smoothness of the RAV4 on a variety of surfaces is appealing. The RAV4's 2.5-liter four-cylinder is thrashy and coarse, but at least the sound conveys some strength instead of weakness. The tight-sealing sill-overlapping doors nicely mute road noise. Wind noise is normally minimal, but it gets noticeable if you have the optional roof rack crossbars fitted. Toyota's controls are excellent, with nice, big rubberized knobs that are easy to use, even when you're wearing winter gloves. Air distribution is also ideal, with forward vents that can be closed off completely as desired and vents for the rear seat. The seat heaters don't get very warm even on the highest setting, however. The controls are easy to find and have functionality that is self-evident. Labels tend to be large and legible. The audio system and climate system controls are islands unto themselves, and everything else is right where you expect it to be. Our only gripe is that the reach to the touchscreen is a little long. It's fairly easy to get in and out of the RAV4 because the short doors can be opened readily in tight parking spots. The rear door openings are nicely squared off at the roof, too, for added head clearance. However, tall or inflexible people will have to duck into the front passenger seat because it's set a bit high and can't be adjusted down. The basic seating position relates well to the steering wheel, pedals and gauges. The telescoping steering wheel satisfied most everyone, but the tallest among us wished it pulled out just a bit more. The same was true of the driver-seat height: Most were happy, but our taller drivers wanted to drop the seat a little lower than it could go. There's suitable space all around, but the front passenger may complain that he or she is too close to the roof because that seat is set too high and lacks any height adjustment. The back seat can accommodate a tall passenger behind a tall driver. There's plenty of headroom in back, plus lots of toe room and a seat recline feature. The front pillars are slender and easy to see around, and a gap between them and the door-mounted mirrors ensures there's no front-corner blind spot. The rearview mirrors are large and offer good coverage. The rear three-quarter blind spot isn't big either because there are extra windows behind the rear doors. The optional surround-view cameras offer multiple useful viewing angles. The rearview camera image is pretty low-res. The RAV4 is well-built inside, with nice layered materials and seams that are invisible because they're built into the styling. It has excellent tactile touches such as rubberized grip surfaces on the interior door pulls and the radio and climate knobs. The too-smooth leather upholstery looks a little artificial and cheap but its seams are tidy and straight. The glovebox and center console are neither remarkably small nor uncommonly large. What makes the difference are the many useful nooks and good-size shelves all around. You'll have plenty of space to put things during long road trips. The door pockets aren't very large, but they will hold big bottles. The liftover height is low, and the RAV4's cargo opening is broad. Behind the rear seats you get 37.5 cubic feet of capacity. The second-row seats fold nearly flat, and the hinge area is cleverly upholstered so there's no crack for items to fall into. Expanded capacity is generous at 69.8 cubic feet. The roll-up cargo cover has a special underfloor storage slot. It's easy to locate and connect to the lower LATCH anchors. Likewise, tethering to the three upper anchors is straightforward. Forward-facing seats and boosters fit readily, but installing a rear-facing infant seat on the passenger side will likely require scooting the front seat up. The too-high front passenger seat mentioned earlier is the issue here. Most RAV4s have a modest tow rating of 1,500 pounds; the Adventure can tow 3,500 pounds. This rating is pretty healthy for a small SUV, and certainly enough for the sort of outdoor gear you might want to tow to the trailhead. The control interface involves a great mix of touchscreen and fixed buttons that are easy to learn without consulting the owner's manual. But the graphics and menu structure within the software already look dated whether you're messing with audio or looking at maps. The sound quality from the base system isn't anything special. Apple CarPlay is available, but there's no Android Auto. 'Droid users must interface with Toyota's dreaded Entune system. One USB data port is supplied along with four power-only USBs: two front, two rear. Bluetooth pairing is easy and requires few confirmation steps. You can opt for a wireless charge pad that will hold the largest phones. Toyota's standard suite of driver aids is quite impressive. It includes adaptive cruise control that works down to 0 mph, automatic emergency braking, drowsy driver detection, automatic high beams, lane keeping assist, and something called Line Tracing Assist, which is an active (but not hands-free) steering aid. Toyota's voice control system works pretty well if you take a few minutes to follow the prompted procedure to teach it your voice. Of course, pressing and holding the voice button longer gets you to Siri or Google Voice on your smartphone, which is even more powerful. Not a bad combination. The  most capable RAV4 trim level is the Adventure,  and that's the one we'd go with. It's got a cool look thanks to some extra  exterior cladding plus an upgraded all-wheel-drive system that includes  torque-vectoring technology. The Adventure also comes with most of the RAV4's  desirable features including an upgraded 8-inch touchscreen, a power liftgate  and premium interior surfaces.  Toyota RAV4 LE You  might expect the RAV4 LE, as the  base-level trim, to be sparsely  equipped, but that's not the case. It comes standard with 17-inch steel wheels,  LED headlights, rear privacy glass, low-profile roof rails, Toyota Safety Sense  2.0 (forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, lane keeping  assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic high beams), a rearview camera, a  60/40-split folding and reclining second-row seat, a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, a 7-inch touchscreen interface with Apple CarPlay  compatibility, one USB port, Bluetooth and a six-speaker sound system.  Toyota RAV4 XLE The XLE adds 17-inch alloy wheels,  automatic LED headlights, foglights, heated mirrors, push-button start,  keyless entry, upgraded interior trim, a  sunroof, blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert, dual-zone  automatic climate control, four additional USB ports (five total) and extending  sun visors. Toyota RAV4 XLE Premium From  there, the XLE Premium adds 19-inch  wheels, a slightly raised suspension (8.6 inches of ground clearance versus 8.4  inches), a power liftgate, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a power-adjustable driver's seat, simulated leather upholstery  (SofTex), and soft-touch dashboard materials.  Toyota RAV4 Adventure The Adventure is a bit special since it  adds some special styling flourishes along with its extra equipment. On top of  getting most of the XLE Premium's contents, the Adventure has unique 19-inch  alloy wheels, fender flares, all-weather floor mats, taller roof rails, an  upgraded rearview camera (with guidelines), embossed seating details, an  upgraded driver information display, an 8-inch touchscreen and satellite radio.  The Adventure trim level is also rated to tow up to 3,500 pounds, while all  other RAV4 trim levels can only pull 1,500 pounds.  Toyota RAV4 Limited The Limited builds on the XLE Premium's  equipment with chrome exterior trim, driver-seat memory functions, an  auto-dimming mirror, the 8-inch touchscreen and a Toyota navigation system.  Some  of the Limited's upgrades can be added to the Adventure, XLE Premium and XLE  trim levels through a variety of packages. Other options, depending on the trim  level, include a hands-free liftgate, a surround-view parking camera, a parking  sensor system with automatic braking, a panoramic sunroof, a heated steering wheel,  heated and ventilated front seats, wireless smartphone charging and an  11-speaker JBL sound system.

    "full_description": "For 2017, the Toyota Prius' formerly optional Safety Sense package (which includes some advanced driver aid features) is now standard on all Prius trims. A new Prius One trim level also debuts this year. When the  Toyota Prius was overhauled for the 2016 model year, it arrived with an updated  exterior design, a more accommodating cabin and a much-improved ride  quality.\u00a0\u00a0  The Prius'  essential appeal, of course, is fuel economy. And with an EPA rating of 52 mpg  in combined driving, the latest Prius delivers in a big way. Even if you drive  it with a heavy foot, this Prius will return better mileage than just about  every car on the road. There's  more to like about the Prius than its fuel efficiency. For one, it's a  practical hatchback with more cargo room than a typical hybrid sedan. It's also  quieter than you'd expect of a compact hatchback, with very little road and  engine noise when you're driving around town. And with the exception of  Toyota's clunky Entune smartphone app, the technology interface (navigation,  audio, phone) is also slick, stylish and easy to use. Last  year's overhaul put more distance between the Prius and its peers. The Chevrolet Volt is an obvious rival, offering  similar hatchback utility and more understated style. But it's also a plug-in  hybrid (competing more with the plug-in Prius Prime) and is more expensive.  Instead, check out the new Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid, which is a surprising equal to the  Prius in almost every measure. If you're looking for more rear passenger room,  midsize sedans such as the Ford Fusion Hybrid or Toyota Camry Hybrid are also worth considering. The 2017  Toyota Prius comes standard with antilock disc brakes, stability and traction  control, front side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, a driver knee  airbag and a passenger seat cushion airbag. Also standard for 2017 is a  rearview camera forward collision warning, forward collision mitigation with  automatic braking, and lane departure warning and intervention. Blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert comes standard on the Prius Four and  Four Touring. The Safety  Connect system that can be added to Prius Four and Four Touring is  subscription-based (with a one-year free trial) and includes automatic  collision notification, stolen vehicle locator, and one-touch access to  roadside and emergency assistance. In Edmunds  brake testing, a Prius Three came to a halt from 60 mph in 120 feet, an average  result for the class. Notably, we picked the 2017 Toyota Prius as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars.\nWhat's it like to live with?\nTo learn more about the Toyota Prius of this generation, read about our experiences from living with a 2016 Toyota Prius. After its debut, we went out and bought one, holding onto it for almost four years and racking up more than 30,000 miles. We cover everything from this hybrid's real-world fuel economy to seat comfort and cargo space. Please note that the 2017 Toyota Prius differs from our long-term 2016 model in that the newer model includes more standard safety features. It's the same generation, though, so most of our observations still apply. If fuel economy is a priority when you're shopping for a new car, you can't do much better than the 2017 Toyota Prius. It delivers some of the best mileage of any car on the road, along with the utility of a hatchback and a comfortable, quiet ride. The 2017 Prius sacrifices speed for mileage, so its sluggish  acceleration is part of the package. With its excellent noise suppression and  initial surge of electric acceleration, the Prius doesn't feel particularly  slow around town. It mainly suffers during higher speed situations such as  getting on a freeway or attempting to pass slower traffic. One area in which the latest Prius is much improved over its  predecessor is the ride quality. It feels more substantial on the road, so you  get less noise, fewer jolts over bumps and a solid feel through the steering  wheel. It's still not as refined as some other traditional sedans in the  midsize class, but considering its level of fuel efficiency, it's not a bad  trade-off.  Older  Prius models had a quirky, futuristic interior layout that, although useful,  suffered from cheap-looking and cheap-feeling plastics and fabrics. The latest  Prius has a more conventional layout and higher-quality materials. A stubby  shifter with a separate Park button is used for selecting forward, reverse and  neutral. A speedometer and gauge array sits high in the center of the dash, and  although it looks cool, it's not an ideal location. There is, however, an  optional head-up display that can display the most crucial information directly  in front of the driver. Interesting  seat fabrics and imitation leather show up even on lower trim levels, and the  layout and controls are easy to understand and use. The 7-inch touchscreen  responds quickly to commands, and though high-level smartphone integration  requires a clumsy Entune app, you can do without and still have a satisfying  experience via USB or Bluetooth audio connections. Cargo  space stands at 24.6 cubic feet, an impressive number that's a full 3 cubic  feet more than the previous-generation Prius. The Prius One, Two Eco and Prius  Four twins offer even more cavernous space &mdash; 27.4 cubic feet  &mdash; as the lack of a spare tire allows for a lower load floor.  The Prius  One and Two are similarly equipped, with the One missing just a few minor  features, such as a rear window wiper. Otherwise, standard feature highlights  for both include 15-inch wheels, automatic LED headlights, LED running lights  and taillights, heated mirrors, keyless entry (driver door only) and ignition,  automatic climate control, dual 4.2-inch driver information screens, adaptive  cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, cloth upholstery, a  height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, a 6.1-inch  touchscreen display, a rearview camera, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity,  voice recognition with Siri Eyes Free, and a six-speaker audio system with a  USB port, an auxiliary audio jack and a CD player. All 2017 Prius trims also  come standard with forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking,  lane departure warning and intervention, and automatic high beams.The more  efficient Prius Two Eco comes with ultralow-rolling resistance tires, a lighter  lithium-ion hybrid battery, an inflation kit instead of a spare tire, and  illuminated keyless entry. The rear wiper that comes standard on the Two trims  is not offered here. Inside the  Prius Three you'll find simulated leather on the steering wheel and armrests,  white interior accents, a wireless phone charging pad and the Toyota Entune  premium infotainment system with a 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, satellite  radio, HD radio, and access to apps such as Pandora, iHeartRadio, OpenTable and  Yelp when paired with a smartphone running the Entune app. The Prius  Four comes with a blind-spot monitoring system, rear cross-traffic alert,  automatic wipers, simulated leather upholstery with contrasting white  stitching, heated front seats, a power driver seat with adjustable lumbar,  seatback storage pockets and a rear cargo cover. Standard  equipment on the Three Touring or Four Touring includes everything from the  corresponding Three or Four, plus 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, LED  clearance lights, unique rear bumper styling, and imitation-leather upholstery  with contrasting blue stitching. The Prius  Three and Four can be upgraded with the Advanced Technology package, which  consists of a sunroof and a head-up display. Finally, the Prius Four and Four  Touring can be equipped with the Premium Convenience package, which includes a  10-speaker JBL audio system, a self-parking system and Safety Connect emergency  services.  The 2017 Toyota Prius comes with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder  engine and a pair of electric motors/generators. Their combined power is sent  through an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (CVT)  that feeds as much as 121 horsepower to the front wheels. Light to moderate  braking transforms one of the electric motors into a generator to keep the  hybrid battery topped up. We tested a Prius Three and recorded a 0-to-60 mph time of  9.8 seconds. That's a few tenths quicker than the last-generation Prius but still  slower than most average hatchbacks. By comparison, a Camry Hybrid gets to 60  mph in 7.7 seconds, something to keep in mind if you get nervous when merging  onto the highway. The upside to the Prius' leisurely acceleration is an EPA fuel economy rating of 52 mpg combined (54 city/50 highway). Our  on-road testing of a Prius Three proved that this result can be readily matched  or surpassed. Those looking for ultimate frugality can turn to the new Prius  Two Eco, which returns an astonishing 56 mpg combined (58 city/53 highway).\u00a0 ",

    "full_description": "For 2017, the 4Runner is carried over with minimal changes. The Trail and Trail Premium are renamed TRD Off-Road and TRD Off-Road Premium, and the TRD Pro Series is available in three additional colors. The last of an increasingly rare breed of truck-based SUVs, the 4Runner will take you off the beaten path like few other production vehicles. Adverse terrain is where it thrives, so if that's not where you generally tread, the Toyota Highlander is a better choice.  While day-to-day commuting isn't the 4Runner's  forte, this midsize SUV is thoughtfully designed. Weekend excursions are what  this traditional SUV does best thanks to rugged drivetrain hardware and enough  ground clearance to deal with tricky off-road situations. Its cargo area is  quite versatile, too, especially when equipped with the optional sliding rear  cargo deck.  Look no further if you want a midsize SUV with real  off-road capability and rugged sensibility. The 2017 4Runner is nearly the last man  standing when it comes to truck-based SUVs. If you don't venture off-road or  only deal with snowy pavement, a more modern crossover is a better choice. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions,  although trim levels share many aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2014 Toyota 4Runner Trail (4.0L V6 | 5-speed automatic | 4WD). NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current 4Runner has received very few  changes beyond minor adjustments to feature content and trim levels (Trail  became TRD Off-Road in 2017). Our findings remain broadly applicable to this  year's 4Runner. The 4.0-liter V6 gets the 4Runner up to 60 mph in 8.1 seconds, which translates to easy freeway merging and decent climbing power up long grades. It's not the most powerful engine in the class, but it does the job. The 4Runner's brakes have plenty of stopping power, especially in terms of initial bite. But this brings with it a notable amount of nosedive. Panic stops require a few extra feet compared to more modern crossovers. A bit slow to respond but predictable. Offers reasonable feel in corners. Straight-ahead driving, on the other hand, feels murky and we sometimes found it necessary to make sizable corrections in response to road imperfections and side winds. It's stable in corners but doesn't like to be rushed due to its weight and high center of gravity. The optional KDSS auto-disconnect stabilizer bars are larger and repel body lean better than the standard setup. Throttle response is smooth and progressive, and the five-speed automatic transmission shifts seamlessly. It would be better with another gear to choose from. The 4Runner has part-time four-wheel drive, crawl control, active traction control and a rear locking differential. The real gem is the optional KDSS technology that automatically disconnects both stabilizer bars when maximum articulation is needed. A top performer in this class. Seats have decent shape and range of adjustment, but the padding could stand to be more generous and seat bottoms are short. Overall comfort is good, but stops well short of what we'd call excellent. The ride isn't necessarily firm, but there is a fair bit of shake and body movement. Instead of crashing over bumps, our 4Runner tended to jostle about lazily in response to road imperfections. Good road noise isolation most of the time, but the squarish shape isn't particularly adept at quelling wind noise. Switchgear is logical and easy to use but the Entune navigation screen is small. Overhead off-road controls are a good use of space. An extra 3 inches of step-up height relative to crossovers goes with the territory with an off-road-biased SUV such as this. Front and rear access are similar; the optional side step covers both. The doors open nice and wide. There's plenty of front head- and legroom for tall folks, though we should note the 4Runner we tested did not have a sunroof. The rear seats offer similar headroom. There is a bit less legroom back there, but 6-footers still fit. Easy to see over the hood and find the front corners. Rear visibility is surprisingly good straight out the back and is further enhanced by a backup camera, but the rear quarters have the usual SUV blind spots. The new 4Runner has tight gaps outside and an attractive interior. The fabric seats are grippy, easy to clean and good-looking. Plenty of little nooks in the dash plus a decent console bin, glovebox and door pockets. The rear seatbacks fold flat, and it's easy to pack the sizable cargo hold (88.8 cubic feet seats down, 46.3 cubic feet seats up) because of its squarish shape. One staffer actually tossed a sleeping bag back there and spent the night. There's 4,700 pounds of towing capacity, a useful figure that covers most boats and many small camping trailers. And you can believe it because Toyota is one of the few automakers that has adopted the SAE-standardized tow rating procedure. If you're shopping 2017 4Runners, off-road capability is  likely a priority or you would be (or should be) shopping station wagons or  crossovers. In light of that, the sweet spot in the 4Runner lineup is the TRD Off-Road Premium. It's the most  affordable way to gain access to a locking rear differential and the KDSS  suspension option, which enhances its off-road chops while maintaining manners  on the road. Its \"Premium\" billing, however, adds creature comforts  such as heated front seats with easy-clean premium vinyl upholstery, heated  power outside mirrors and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.  The SR5 is the base model but it's not bare-bones. Standard features include cloth  upholstery, skid plates, foglights, a backup camera, keyless entry, five  12-volt power outlets and a 120-volt AC power outlet. Stepping up to TRD  Off-Road adds some serious off-road chops in the form of a locking rear  differential, wheels that are 0.5 inch wider and a crawl control function. It  also offers the optional KDSS suspension. Premium variants  of the SR5 and TRD Off-Road get power-adjustable and heated outside mirrors,  premium vinyl upholstery, navigation and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.  Serious off-roaders should consider the TRD Pro, which starts with the TRD  Off-Road Premium and adds revised front springs, Bilstein dampers with rear  remote reservoirs, Nitto Terra Grappler tires and a front skid plate. Limited models  top the 4Runner range. These models get a Torsen center differential (4x4  models only) plus a host of features to make it better suited to on-pavement  use: 20-inch wheels, a sunroof, dual-zone climate control, parking alerts,  perforated leather seat upholstery, a 15-speaker premium audio system. Power  running boards are optional.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota Avalon remains largely unchanged for the 2007 model year. All models now have tire-pressure sensors, and a navigation system is now available on the Touring trim. The superbly refined 2007 Toyota Avalon is about as good as it gets this side of $40,000. It's essentially a luxury sedan without the luxury badge. For much of its life, the Toyota Avalon has fit this description: short on excitement, but solid, roomy and dependable. Thanks to a full redesign a couple of years ago, however, you can't really call this large sedan boring. It may not be as exciting as a Chrysler 300, but it does have a 268-horsepower V6 and enough luxury-themed features to make it seem like a Lexus but without the L-shaped badge.Because it was engineered from its top to its tires in the U.S., Toyota calls the Avalon its \"most American\" car yet. And as one would expect, \"more American\" means it's bigger, roomier and more powerful. Rear passengers even benefit from a flat floor and seats that recline up to 10 degrees. The overall feel is much more upscale than that of your average Toyota car. In the past, the Avalon was so similar to the Toyota Camry that the price difference was hard to justify. That's no longer the case with the latest Toyota Avalon, which offers more room, more power and more luxury than most Camry owners can imagine. If you're shopping for a full-size sedan, you owe it to yourself to try a 2007 Toyota Avalon. If relaxation and refinement are high on your list, Toyota's big sedan won't disappoint. The front-wheel-drive Toyota Avalon is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 providing 268 hp and 248 pound-feet of torque. Toyota's full-size sedan needs just 6.9 seconds to reach 60 mph. A five-speed automatic is the only transmission offered. The EPA estimates that the Avalon will deliver 22 miles per gallon city and 31 highway, with a combined average of 26 miles per gallon -- impressive numbers for a full-size sedan with a powerful V6. Side airbags for front passengers are standard, along with side curtain airbags for front and rear passengers and a driver-side knee airbag. Traction and stability control systems, along with a brake assist system that detects emergency braking and applies maximum pressure to reduce stopping distances, are optional. All 2007 Toyota Avalon models have antilock disc brakes and a tire-pressure monitoring system. In IIHS testing, the Avalon earned a top score of \"Good\" for its protection of occupants in frontal-offset and side-impact crashes. As full-size sedans go, the 2007 Toyota Avalon is rewarding to drive. Not surprisingly, it really shines on the open highway. The cabin remains quiet, the V6 engine has plenty of passing power and the suspension, even with the firmer underpinnings of the Touring package, never feels harsh. The Avalon is no athlete, but this Toyota car carries itself with a great deal of composure on winding roads. Additionally, a tidy turning radius makes it feel unexpectedly nimble on tight city streets. The XLS and Limited models are modern and luxurious, while the sporty Touring model is intentionally austere, with black leather seats and a three-spoke steering wheel. The instrument cluster is highlighted by glowing Optitron gauges surrounded by chrome rings, and movable panels that conceal the radio and navigation controls give the dash a sleek look. The front seats are wide and accommodating. The rear seats are more comfortable than in the previous Avalon, thanks to limo levels of legroom and a manually reclining back cushion. A 6-footer can sit in back with more than enough knee and headroom, and with a nearly flat floor, getting three across on carpool day is no problem. A large sedan, the 2007 Toyota Avalon is available in four trim levels: XL, Touring, XLS and Limited. Although it's the base version, the XL still offers such amenities as electroluminescent gauges, a cabin air filter, a CD player, automatic climate control, a tilt/telescoping wheel, a power seat and 16-inch alloy wheels. The Touring model is noticeably sportier, with a firmer suspension, unique 17-inch wheels, leather seats, a power passenger seat and aluminum interior trim. The XLS and Limited are more upscale; the XLS adds a power moonroof, heated outside mirrors and a six-disc CD changer. The Limited includes such items as rain-sensing wipers; perforated leather seats with memory, heating and cooling; wood grain trim; a power rear sunshade; a keyless startup system; and a premium 12-speaker JBL stereo. Many of the upscale features on the XLS and Limited are also available as options on the lower trims. Other options, depending on trim level, include a navigation system, satellite radio and adaptive cruise control.",

    "full_description": "For 2014, the Toyota Camry is unchanged apart from the addition of another trim level to the lineup, the SE Sport. This model adds bigger wheels, a sunroof and a power driver seat to the four-cylinder SE's equipment list. Later in the model year, Toyota slightly revised the Camry's standard equipment. For the \"2014.5\" Camry, a rearview camera became standard across the board, while the upper trims picked up some enhanced audio features. These later Camry models also have slightly better crash test scores. Given its well-rounded nature and long-standing history of dependability, the 2014 Toyota Camry is a solid choice in the highly competitive midsize sedan segment. The 2014 Toyota Camry stands as a quietly competent midsize sedan. Though it's not particularly glamorous, the Camry checks off most of the boxes for most folks shopping this segment.\nChief among this Toyota's desirable traits is its peppy yet economical performance with either the four-cylinder or V6 engine. (Those seeking maximum mpg should consider the Camry Hybrid, which is covered in a separate review.) The Camry also offers comfortable seating, solid build quality, a sterling reputation for reliability and low ownership costs.\nThe most significant turnoff for some people will be in the way that the Camry drives. Although the ride quality is smooth, the driving experience overall feels rather disconnected and numb. The exceptions are the SE trim levels, which, thanks to their more firmly tuned suspensions, provide sharper, more involved handling. The SE isn't a sport sedan, but we do think most people will prefer the way it feels from behind the wheel.\nUnderstandably, the family sedan segment is chock full of good choices. That's certainly not a problem for consumers, though, as it just means there are more options to consider. If you're seeking sportier handling from an otherwise top-rated sedan, the Honda Accord, Mazda 6 and Nissan Altima are worth a try. With their more distinctive styling and similarly broad list of strengths, the Ford Fusion and Kia Optima also deserve a look, as do the value-themed Hyundai Sonata and roomy Volkswagen Passat.\nWe think most people will be quite pleased with a 2014 Toyota Camry purchase. But with so many great choices, we suggest planning a weekend's worth of test-drives. Every 2014 Toyota Camry features front-wheel drive and a six-speed automatic transmission.\nBase Camrys are powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that produces 178 horsepower and 170 pound-feet of torque. In Edmunds performance testing, a Camry LE with this engine accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 8.4 seconds, about average for a four-cylinder midsize sedan. With EPA-estimated fuel economy of 28 mpg combined (25 mpg city/35 mpg highway), the four-cylinder Camry is among the class leaders.\nAvailable on SE and XLE trims is a 3.5-liter V6 that generates 268 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque, which helps the Camry V6 reach 60 mph in 6.6 seconds, an average time for upgrade engines in this class. Fuel economy rates an impressive 25 mpg combined (21 mpg city/31 mpg highway). The 2014 Toyota Camry comes standard with antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front- and rear-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and knee airbags for both driver and passenger. A blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert is also available for the Camry SE and XLE. The optional Safety Connect telematics system for the XLE includes roadside assistance, stolen vehicle location and automatic collision notification.\nIn Edmunds braking tests, a Camry LE stopped from 60 mph in 129 feet, a bit longer than average for the segment. An SE V6, with stickier tires, performed the same test in 119 feet, which is better than average.\nIn government crash testing, the 2014 and 2014.5 Camry received a top five-star score for overall crash protection, with four stars for overall frontal protection and five stars for overall side protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Camry the best possible rating of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side and roof strength tests. In that agency's small-overlap frontal-offset test, the 2014 Camry scored a \"Poor\" rating (the worst rating), though the 2014.5 Camry fared better with a second-best \"Acceptable\" rating in this test. No matter the year designation, the Camry's head restraints and seats received a \"Good\" rating for whiplash protection in rear impacts. Both four-cylinder and V6 engines generate ample power for  everyday driving, and that power is delivered in a smooth, quiet fashion. Gearchanges  are likewise unobtrusive, and for a car that earns such high fuel economy  numbers, the transmission surprises with quick downshifts when additional power  is needed. On the highway, the 2014 Toyota Camry is comfortable and an  excellent long-distance companion.\nThe electric-assisted steering feels pretty good in the V6  and SE versions. But the steering in non-SE four-cylinder models feels somewhat  lifeless in comparison and lacks precision. Most drivers will probably be fine  with the way the Toyota Camry drives, but we still recommend the SE. It's not  exactly sporty, but it feels more in line with the handling and responsiveness  of the Toyota's closest rivals. The interior of the 2014 Camry feels roomy and its thin front pillars provide good outward visibility. What the cabin design lacks in cohesiveness, it makes up for with generally good materials quality, especially the handsome stitching on the dash and door panels of upper trims. The spacious rear seat is complemented by a nicely reclined seatback angle that helps the Camry match the Honda Accord for the most comfortable backseat in the class.\nThe Camry's top-of the-line audio system also features a suite of smartphone-connected services that include the Bing search engine, Pandora streaming radio and real-time sports and stock information. Getting started with the smartphone integration system can be a hassle, though, since you have to install an app on your phone and register for an account, plus you always need an active data connection to use it. The Camry's touchscreen interface has straightforward menus, but it's sometimes unresponsive to user touch.\nAt 15.4 cubic feet, the Camry's trunk capacity is about average, although the 60/40-split rear seat folds down to yield more cargo space when necessary. \nThe 2014 Camry L features 16-inch steel wheels, air-conditioning, power windows and mirrors, cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, split-folding rear seats, a trip computer, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a 6.1-inch touchscreen display and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, an auxiliary audio jack and a USB/iPod interface.\nThe 2014 Camry LE adds automatic headlamps, power door locks with remote keyless entry, audio controls on the steering wheel and an outside temperature display.\nThe 2014 SE includes a sport-tuned suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, heated mirrors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, sport seats and unique interior and exterior styling treatments. The SE Sport (four-cylinder only) adds 18-inch wheels, a sunroof and an eight-way power driver seat. The SE V6 models don't have the sunroof but do get the 18-inch wheels and power driver seat as well as keyless ignition/entry, a navigation system, voice controls, HD and satellite radio, and the Entune smartphone and Web integration system. \nThe 2014 XLE reverts to the LE's equipment and softer suspension settings and adds 17-inch alloy wheels, heated mirrors, foglights, a sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate control and an eight-way power driver seat. The XLE V6 models add HD and satellite radio, Entune, a navigation system, a rearview camera, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather upholstery, a four-way power front-passenger seat and heated front seats. \nSome of the extra features found on the higher trims can be added as options to the lower trim levels, though availability varies according to the region of the country where you live. Other options, depending on trim level, include a blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert, Safety Connect telematics and a 10-speaker JBL sound system (SE V6 and XLE four-cylinder). For the XLE V6, the optional JBL system comes bundled with an upgraded navigation system and a larger 7-inch touchscreen display.\nFor the 2014.5 Camry (those built starting in December 2013), there are slight differences. All Camry models, starting with the L, receive the rearview camera as standard. Additionally, Toyota renamed the audio and infotainment systems, which can be confusing. The base system is called Entune Audio, the midlevel is Entune Audio Plus, and then finally and Entune Premium Audio with Navigation and App Suite. \nFor these 2014.5 models, Entune Audio Plus is standard on the XLE, and it adds satellite radio, HD radio and traffic/weather reporting. The SE V6 and XLE V6 have Entune Premium Audio with Nav and App Suite, which adds the navigation system and smartphone app integration (such as Bing, OpenTable and Pandora) as standard.\nAs before, these upgrade systems can potentially be added as options, as can the 10-speaker JBL sound system.

    "full_description": "The Toyota Highlander sails into 2012 unchanged. The 2012 Toyota Highlander is an excellent choice for a do-all family vehicle, though several competitors offer more interior space and utility. Crossover SUVs like the 2012 Toyota Highlander owe  their appeal to the canny mix of traits they present. The best of the bunch handle  like cars while delivering the family-friendly features and boundless utility that  made their truck-based SUV forebears such hot tickets back in the day.\nIn many respects, the Highlander gets this formula  just right. It feels spry on the road and is easy to drive, with especially brisk  acceleration from the V6 engine. On hand are all the amenities you'd expect  from a solid family hauler, starting with a quiet, roomy cabin that seats up to  seven passengers. While the Highlander's third row is less spacious than that  of some rivals, it's easy to reach thanks to a nifty 40/20/40-split second row with  a removable center seat that facilitates walk-through access. This crossover also  has fuel efficiency to its credit, with both the inline-4 and V6 delivering impressive  mileage.\nStill, this segment is highly competitive, and the 2012  Toyota Highlander isn't the only pick to strike a compelling balance. General  Motors offers a trio of crossovers -- the Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse  and GMC Acadia -- that have a size advantage. If you want a larger crossover with  a roomier interior, any one of these three will be a better match. Other solid  bets include the muscular Dodge Durango, the athletic Mazda CX-9,  the distinctive Ford Flex and the upscale Ford  Explorer. These rivals are certainly  worthy, but for many shoppers, the Highlander's versatility and friendly disposition  will no doubt make it an ideal choice. The  2012 Toyota Highlander is available with a choice of two engines. The base  model can be had with a 2.7-liter inline-4 engine that puts out 187 horsepower  and 186 pound-feet of torque. Power is sent to the front wheels through a  six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy estimates are 20 mpg city/25  mpg highway and 22 mpg combined.\nOptional  for the base and SE and standard for the Highlander Limited is a 3.5-liter V6  that's rated at 270 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. A five-speed automatic and  front-wheel drive are standard; all-wheel drive is optional. A Highlander  Limited AWD tested by Edmunds sprinted from zero to 60 mph in just 7.5 seconds,  which makes it one of the quicker crossovers on the road. With front-wheel  drive, the Highlander V6 returns EPA estimates of 18 city/24 highway/20  combined; adding all-wheel drive drops these numbers to 17/22/19. Properly  equipped, a Highlander V6 can tow up to 5,000 pounds. The  Highlander comes standard with antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control,  side-impact airbags for front seat passengers, full-length side curtain  airbags, a driver-side knee airbag and active front head restraints. Hill-start  assist is also standard. All-wheel-drive models also gain hill-descent control.\nIn  government crash tests, the Highlander earned an overall rating of four stars  (out of a possible five), with four stars for frontal crash protection and five  stars for side-impact protection. In tests conducted by the Insurance Institute  for Highway Safety, the Highlander received \"Good\" ratings (the  highest possible) in both frontal-offset and side impact tests. When  it comes to driving dynamics, the 2012 Toyota Highlander is one of the more well-rounded  choices in its segment. You get decent handling from the fully independent  suspension, and the ride quality is surprisingly smooth. Being a bit smaller  than other larger crossovers, the Highlander is easier to maneuver,  particularly in tight parking lots. The light-effort steering also helps here, though  it is rather numb and uninspiring compared to some of its rivals.\nThe  Highlander grows even more appealing with the 3.5-liter V6, thanks to that  engine's strong acceleration; the V6 moves the 4,000-pound crossover with a  briskness that makes this Toyota seem smaller than it is. The fact that this  powertrain is also among the most fuel-efficient in the category is an added  bonus. The four-cylinder engine gets slightly better fuel economy, but we  wouldn't recommend it for anybody except the most frugal-minded, given the  sacrifice made in terms of performance. The  2012 Toyota Highlander features one of the better-looking cabins in the  segment, and this is especially true of the top-of-the-line Limited model. Gauges  and controls boast a familiar and straightforward layout, making then a cinch  to use. The cabin also offers superb visibility from most angles.\nThere's  no lack of space in the front- and second-row seats, but legroom is cramped in  the third row, and as such, it's suitable only for younger kids. Models like  the Flex fare better in this regard. On the plus side, the Highlander's second-row  bench slides fore and aft to alter the ratio of legroom to cargo capacity, and  the seat also reclines for greater comfort. This seat's unique 40/20/40-split  design, which has a removable center section that stows neatly in a special  compartment beneath the center console, makes it easy to access the way-back  bench even with a pair of child car seats strapped into the second row.\nWhen  you have cargo to haul, the Highlander offers 95.4 cubic feet of space with the  second- and third-row seatbacks folded down. It's a robust figure and better  than many competitors, but GM's full-size crossovers offer even more. \nThe  entry-level Highlander comes equipped with 17-inch alloy wheels, rear privacy  glass, cloth upholstery, a 40/20/40-split-folding second-row seat that both  reclines and slides fore and aft, a 50/50-split-folding third-row seat,  air-conditioning (with rear controls), a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel  and a six-speaker CD sound system with an auxiliary audio jack.\nStep  up to the SE and you get a sunroof, a power liftgate (with a separate glass  hatch), roof rails, foglamps, windshield wiper de-icer, leather upholstery, an eight-way power driver seat, heated  front seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, cargo area-mounted releases for  folding down the second-row seats, a back-up camera and an upgraded audio  system (optional on base) with satellite radio, a USB port and Bluetooth  connectivity/streaming audio.\nThe  Limited adds 19-inch alloy wheels, additional chrome exterior trim and  power-folding/heated outside mirrors with puddle lamps. The cabin also gets  upgraded leather upholstery, tri-zone automatic climate control, keyless  ignition/entry, a 10-way power driver seat, a four-way power passenger seat and  wood-grain accents.\nThe  Highlander's options list varies by trim level and region, but those available  include a towing prep package, an upgraded JBL sound system (with six-disc CD  changer and subwoofer), a navigation system (includes the JBL sound system but  with a four-disc CD changer) and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.",

The 2013 Toyota Highlander is an excellent choice for a do-all family vehicle, though several competitors offer more interior space and utility. The successful recipe for a family-friendly  crossover SUV goes something like this. To a platform with carlike handling and  ride qualities add roomy passenger and cargo accommodations, bake in  reliability and refinement, sprinkle liberally with convenience features and  wrap in attractive though conservative styling. Follow this formula and you get  the 2013 Toyota Highlander, a crossover that will satisfy the appetites of  countless savvy consumers.\nOnce you're on the road, the not-too-big,  not-too-small Highlander is easygoing, and it can even be spirited if you opt  for the powerful V6. Everything you'd want in an ideal family hauler is here, notably  a quiet, roomy cabin that seats up to seven passengers, plus features such as  keyless ignition/entry and a back-up camera that make running all those errands  easier on Mom and Dad.

    "full_description": "A midsize sedan with an efficient gasoline-hybrid powertrain, the 2021 Toyota Camry Hybrid offers greater power and fuel economy than a standard Camry in exchange for a modest price premium. Not long ago, the Camry Hybrid battled numerous competitors. But with consumers migrating to SUVs and the discontinuations of the Ford Fusion Hybrid and Kia Optima Hybrid for the 2021 model year, the Camry Hybrid's remaining rivals include the Honda Accord Hybrid and Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, each of which gives the Toyota a run for its money. \nFor 2021, Toyota expands the Camry Hybrid lineup with the new XSE trim. Similar to the regular Camry's XSE trim, it has a sportier-looking front end, bigger wheels and a sport-tuned suspension for slightly more responsive handling. All Camrys this year further benefit from freshened exterior styling, a larger infotainment touchscreen option, and more advanced driving assistance systems. Be sure to review our full Expert Rating to learn more about the Camry Hybrid. If you're shopping for a 2021 Toyota Camry Hybrid, chances are you want to save money on gas or drive a vehicle that emits fewer pollutants into the atmosphere. Either way, the most affordable and efficient version of the Camry Hybrid is the base LE trim level. If you're willing to pay a little more in terms of price and get a little less in terms of efficiency, the SE trim offers a sporty look and handling at the expense of outright efficiency. How does the Camry Hybrid drive? There's goodness in broad swaths with the Camry Hybrid. The sedan's power is decent in day-to-day use. In our testing, we measured a 0-60 mph time of about 8 seconds, which is slightly better than average for a midsize hybrid sedan. \n\nHybrid performance is smooth and care-free. Braking is predictable and very usable in everyday applications, and the low-rolling-resistance tires, which are common in this class, also provide average braking distances. Steering and handling are decent for the class. Overall, it's acceptable from a performance standpoint, but day-to-day commuting is its main strength. How comfortable is the Camry Hybrid? Comfort is where any midsize sedan should shine and the Camry Hybrid does just that. The climate control creates a welcome environment, and the seating comfortably accommodates a range of body types. The optional ventilated seats are a boon in warmer climates, and there's very little noise in the cabin coming from wind or the road at highway speeds.\n\nOur only nitpick is the XLE hybrid's ride comfort. While great around town, it can sometimes feel overly buoyant at highway speeds. The extra weight of the hybrid system is evident. How\u2019s the interior? Inviting, roomy and easy to live with are good hallmarks to have in such a competitive class, and the Camry has them all. The interior is easy to use, and all controls are readily within reach. The driving position is largely adaptable, and most people should easily find a comfortable position behind the wheel. Getting in and out of the vehicle is a cinch due to generous door openings, and there's a good amount of interior room for both front and rear occupants and excellent visibility for the driver. How\u2019s the tech? The Camry Hybrid's smartphone integration includes standard Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa. Both the standard 7-inch and optional 9-inch infotainment touchscreens are easy to read and operate. Built-in navigation is offered on higher trims if you want it. Three USB ports and the option to add a wireless charger should provide plenty of charge for all occupants on the road.\n\nAll 2021 Camrys come with Toyota's Safety Sense 2.5+. It's an impressive suite of standard driver assistance features such as adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking and lane keeping assist. Previously, some of these systems have been too sensitive for our liking, but they've been refined for 2021 and work much better. How\u2019s the storage? The Camry Hybrid retains a full-size trunk with no intrusion from a battery pack whatsoever. With the trunk open, you can't tell it apart from a standard Camry. Hybrid sedans usually force you to give up some practicality, but not this one. The 15.1-cubic-foot trunk area is smaller than the Accord Hybrid's (16.7 cubic feet) but the wide opening with a low liftover height helps you make the most of it.\n\nThe cabin offers a good amount of storage, from the sliding compartment underneath the wireless charger to a nicely sized center armrest bin, plus a small bonus storage cubby on the far left-hand side of the dash. There's also ample room for car seat access, along with easily accessible anchors for speedy installation. How\u2019s the fuel economy? EPA-estimated fuel economy for an XLE Hybrid (which is what we tested) is 46 mpg. That's a solid number for a midsize hybrid sedan. The base LE car returns an even more impressive 52 mpg. By comparison, the Honda Accord Hybrid gets an estimated 43 or 48 mpg, depending on the trim level. We yielded about 42.4 mpg during our time with our XLE test car, which doesn't quite hit the mark but is decently efficient. Is the Camry Hybrid a good value? Long the strong point for Toyota, there's good value in the latest Camry Hybrid. Traditional strong Toyota build quality? Check. The interior materials are a nice quality, and the hybrid matches well against the competition in standard warranty and ownership experience. \n\nWhile the base Camry Hybrid is a little more expensive than the Honda Accord and Hyundai Sonata hybrids, the starting MSRP for the top-spec Camry Hybrid XLE is very cost-effective for this class. The raft of standard safety features and stellar fuel economy are double wins for your wallet. This is as normal and middle-of-the-road as a car can possibly get, yet you get such a huge boost in fuel economy without the usual hallmarks of dare-you-to-buy-it styling and buzzy ride common to extremely fuel-efficient cars. It isn't fun to drive in a traditional sense, but it is fulfilling in the sense that you're doing something for the environment (if that's something you care about) and doing it in comfort.",

    "full_description": "Toyota  totally redesigned the RAV4 for 2019, giving it not only more technology and  better dynamics but added personality. You might even be excused for thinking  it had \u2014 wait for it \u2014 a little bit of attitude. For the  new RAV4 Hybrid model, you get all that plus more power and a lot more  efficiency. \nEPA-estimated  fuel economy is up to 39 mpg combined this year, which is a 6 mpg improvement  over the 2018 model. The battery-assisted powertrain now produces 219  horsepower, making this the most powerful RAV4 since the V6 engine was  discontinued in 2012.\nInside,  the 2019 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid is comfortable and roomy. The controls are easy to  find, and the cabin design has more visual appeal than the outgoing model.  Apple CarPlay comes standard on every RAV4. Toyota's Safety Sense Suite 2.0 is  also standard and includes adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, and  forward collision mitigation with automatic braking. Blind-spot monitoring is  equipped on all but the base trim. On many competitive SUVs, you have to  upgrade to the more expensive trim levels to get these safety features. \nNor  are those competitive SUVs actually all that competitive. No other small  two-row SUV gives you this much efficiency, utility and power. The Mazda CX-5  has a nicer cabin and offers a more engaging driving experience, but there's no  hybrid option. And while the Honda CR-V is a great all-rounder, there's no  official word yet on when a hybrid model will arrive in the United States. \nAlternative-fuel  fans might look to the diesel Chevrolet Equinox, which drives well and is  relatively efficient, but the diesel is only available in pricier trim levels.  You might also consider the Kia Niro or, if you have a place to plug in, the  Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid. However, the Subaru is very pricey for only small  efficiency gains, and the Niro \u2014 while very efficient \u2014 is  overall less appealing than the RAV4. Both also offer significantly less  passenger and cargo space.\nToyota  has this particular market cornered for the moment. It's almost a bonus that  the 2019 RAV4 Hybrid would still be worth considering even if it weren't in a  class by itself.\nNotably, we picked the 2019 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid as one of Edmunds' Best Gas Mileage SUVs for this year. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid XSE (2.5L inline-4  hybrid | CVT automatic | AWD). Acceleration is snappy, especially from around 25 to 40 mph. Electric assist combined with the gas engine's 176 horsepower keeps enough power on tap for lively slingshots around traffic. Our RAV4 Hybrid test unit covered 0-60 mph in 7.8 seconds, a solid result that's more than a second quicker than the non-hybrid RAV4 we've tested. The hybrid's brakes differ from those of a regular RAV4. They are effective in daily situations, but the pedal feels vague and mushy and lacks the feedback needed to stop smoothly every time. Panic-stop performance is underwhelming, largely because of the economy-minded tires. In our braking test, the RAV4 Hybrid needed 131 feet to stop from 60 mph at our test track. Most other top small SUVs stop in the low 120s. The steering is vague around its center point when you're driving at highway speeds. Sometimes you'll feel like you need to make tiny corrections to stay centered. The thing is, it does track well enough if you don't fuss with it. The steering gets more direct when you're driving around turns, but even then there's no real feedback or sense of the road. With the XSE trim and its sport-tuned suspension, the hybrid provides good composure and stability when turning quick corners. It shakes off midcorner bumps without losing stability, and there's minimal body roll. There isn't enough tire grip for any truly sporty driving, but it's consistent with the class. The hybrid's unique continuously variable automatic transmission is smooth at all speeds, whether in town or cruising on the highway. It also copes well with gentle acceleration. But digging into the pedal for any quick burst will rev up the engine and generate the typical obnoxious engine droning that some passengers will not like. All-wheel drive and 8.1 inches of ground clearance give the hybrid some basic tools for modest trail or all-terrain work. It's enough to warrant consideration as a dual-purpose car that saves gas by the week and gets to the ski hill or trailhead by the weekend. The front seats have padding that is both supportive and pliable, and aside from a flattish bottom cushion, they're generally well-shaped. But these are not cradling sport seats, so you'll find yourself sliding around during spirited driving. The rear seats are comfortable enough and recline but lack side bolstering. Despite the XSE's sport-tuned suspension, its underpinnings offer a good combination of comfort and control. Body motion is neither busy nor floaty, and rough patches of bumps and dips don't really upset the cabin. Harsh impacts from driving over potholes sound sharper than they feel, which suggests a need for more sound-deadening materials. The hybrid powertrain toggles between silent and overly noisy, depending on what the engine and transmission are doing. Road noise is nicely muted, but at highway speeds you will hear wind noise if you leave the optional roof rack crossbars fitted. The hybrid system makes Toyota's familiar assortment of electrical whizzings, clickings and whirrings at odd intervals. There's suitable airflow throughout the cabin thanks to strong fan speeds and easily adjusted air vents front and rear. It gets to temp quickly, too. Chunky rubberized control knobs are easy to use, even with gloves. The seat heaters warm quickly, but even the highest setting the seats don't get all that hot. Most every control is logically placed and easy to figure out at a glance. We like how the audio and climate systems are clearly separated. The biggest drawback is the long reach for the driver to the touchscreen and the tuning knob. The high-mounted front seats make for easy entry and exit. The narrow doorsills and minimal side and thigh bolsters also make easy work of getting in and out of the back seat. But the low fixed point of the rear seats will force you to \"drop in\" slightly on entry. The tilt-and-telescoping steering column will help you dial in a clear view of the road ahead. But the height of the front seats, even at their lowest setting, might still be too high for taller drivers. The RAV4 doesn't feel claustrophobic in any seat. The rear seat is especially spacious in all directions. It reclines, too. Taller drivers may feel too close to the roof even in the lowest height setting, and the front passenger's high-mounted seat cannot be lowered at all. The slim front roof pillars help mitigate front-corner blind spots, ensuring a good view of pedestrians and curbs while turning. A rising window line compromises some rear-side visibility, but extra windows behind the rear doors do much to minimize the blind spot. The optional surround-view camera offers multiple useful viewing angles, but the image is fairly low-res. Interior surfaces, touch points and assembly all feel high-quality. Nice tactile touches abound, such as rubberized grips on dials and soft landings for elbows. Toyota's SofTex simulated-leather upholstery feels soft and pliable, and the stitching looks tight and tidy, even if the fabric inserts give it a bit of a rental-car feel. A small center console and molded door pockets large enough for a medium-size bottle are the extent of the hybrid's most useful storage nooks. A nifty tray lined with rubber grip spans a length above the glovebox for items such as a phone or sunglasses. It's a neat idea seemingly imported from the Highlander. The hybrid impressively offers the same luggage room (37.5 cubic feet) as its gas counterpart. A low loading height and wide opening make for easy cargo shuffling. The optional stereo system subwoofer takes up some corner space, but a small cubby with secure netting helps you store smaller items. Four tie-down hooks and a 12-volt power outlet enhance the hybrid's utility. Lower car seat anchors are easily accessible at the base of rear seatbacks. A swatch of vinyl above lower car seat anchor points should help prevent fabric wear due to frequent car seat changes \u2014 a nice touch. Top tether anchor points behind the rear seatbacks are also easily accessible and are hidden out of sight by fabric flaps. The RAV4 has plenty of room for forward-facing seats, but installing a bulky rear-facing seat may require sliding up the front seats somewhat. Other RAV4 variants, such as the non-hybrid Adventure model, can tow up to 3,500 pounds. The hybrid is stuck with a 1,750-pound towing capacity, but that's still a bit better than what you'll get from some other small SUVs. The display is large, and it's easy to pull up maps and menus using touchscreen icons and fixed buttons surrounding the bezel. The graphics look dated, but otherwise the system works well. The optional JBL audio system delivers full, clear sound. Apple CarPlay is available, but Android users will still need to interface with Toyota's clunky Entune system. Only one USB port transmits data, but passengers can charge their devices with four USB ports (two front, two rear). Bluetooth pairing is easy and requires few confirmation steps, and an optional wireless charging pad will hold today's largest phones. The impressive group of driver aids includes stop-and-go adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist, and Lane Tracing Assist, Toyota's nearly self-steering system. In our testing, it worked well in dense highway traffic and free-flowing roads with clear lane markings. Adaptive cruise control defaults to the farthest following distance each time it's switched on. Voice commands are available for basic phone, audio and navigation functions, but they require careful and deliberate verbal input that's easier after you spend time using the setup wizard to teach it your voice. Android and iPhone can go directly to Siri or Google Voice instead by pressing and holding the voice button. The XLE is an undeniable bargain, coming  in under $30,000 and presenting a full roster of safety features, but we'd try  and swing the XSE if we could. That  move is the biggest price jump between trim levels, but you get a full spectrum  of upgrades. From luxuries such as improved interior trim and power driver  seat, to technology such as the 8-inch infotainment screen and 7-inch driver  information display, to practicalities including a power liftgate and added  interior ambient lighting, the XSE is pretty loaded for a reasonable price. \nIf  you live somewhere cold, you'll want the Weather  Prep package with its heated steering wheel and de-icer function for the  windshield wipers. \nAll  RAV4 Hybrid models come with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired to an  electric motor with a continuously variable automatic transmission. And an  additional electric motor is used to power the rear wheels in low-traction  situations. Total system output is 219 horsepower.\nToyota  Safety Sense 2.0 is standard on all RAV4 Hybrid models and includes forward  collision warning, automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, lane  keeping assist, auto high-beam headlights, and adaptive cruise control. \nThe  base LE trim comes relatively well  equipped with 17-inch alloy wheels, roof rails, a rearview camera, LED  headlights and daytime running lights, a height-adjustable driver seat,  60/40-split folding rear seats with adjustable recline, and dual-zone climate  control.\nInfotainment  is handled by a 7-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay smartphone integration  (Android Auto isn't available), Toyota Connected Services (includes onboard  Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, one USB port, and a six-speaker sound system.\nThe XLE trim adds blind-spot monitoring  and rear cross-traffic alert, automatic headlights, integrated foglights,  proximity entry with push-button start, a sunroof, upgraded fabric upholstery,  sliding sun visor extensions, and additional USB ports (five total, including  two for the rear seats). \nOptions  for the XLE include the Weather package, which adds a heated leather-trimmed  steering wheel and automatic wipers with a de-icer function. The XLE  Convenience package equips a power-adjustable driver's seat, heated front seats  and a power liftgate. An 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with satellite  radio can also be added to the XLE.\nMoving  up to the XSE gets you the 8-inch  touchscreen system and the contents of the Convenience package. You also get  black-painted 18-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, two-tone exterior  paint, simulated-leather upholstery (SofTex), upgraded interior trim materials,  a digital speedometer, a 7-inch digital driver-information display, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, dynamic guidelines for the rearview camera, and  additional interior ambient lighting. \nOptional  for the XLE and the XSE is a Technology package with front and rear parking  sensors, automatic rear cross-traffic braking, an auto-dimming rearview mirror  (XLE), and a wireless charging pad (XSE only). \nAt  the top of the range is the Limited.  It arrives with 18-inch chrome-finished wheels, the parking sensors and  automatic rear cross-traffic braking, an integrated navigation system, and  two-position memory for the driver's seat.\nBut  wait, there's more! The Limited Grade Weather package adds a heated steering  wheel, ventilated front seats, heated outboard rear passenger seats, and the  de-icing and automatic wipers. You can also get the Limited Grade Advanced  Technology package with proximity-entry sensors on all four doors, foot  activation for the power liftgate, the wireless charging pad, and a  surround-view parking camera system. \nFinally,  the XSE and the Limited can be upgraded with an 11-speaker JBL stereo system  (bundled with navigation for XSE) and a panoramic sunroof. Adaptive headlights  are available as a stand-alone option for the Limited. ",

    "full_description": "For the 2006 Toyota Avalon, the availability of stability control has been expanded to include the XL and Touring trim levels. Keyless startup is now standard, rather than optional, on the Limited. Need a full-size sedan with plenty of room, power, luxury and refinement? The superbly refined 2006 Toyota Avalon is about as good as it gets this side of $40,000. It would seem buyers of full-size sedans generally aren't interested in character. Most big four-doors are dull pieces of machinery to look at and a snooze to drive. The beauty in such a vehicle lies in what it can do for the customer -- provide lots of space for people and things with no compromise in ride or occupant comfort. Such a sedan should look upscale, but not gaudy, providing just enough glitz and luxury to let others know you have achieved a degree of success in life. Finally, such a vehicle must also be reliable and able to handle years of commuting without so much as a whimper. Since its introduction in 1995, the Toyota Avalon has fit this description: bland as egg whites, but solid, roomy and dependable. Thanks to a full redesign for 2005, you can't really call the Avalon boring. It may not be as exciting as a Chrysler 300, but this time around, Toyota's engineers and designers have given the Avalon a little more style, extra horsepower and varying trims that add distinct flavors to the formerly \"vanilla only\" sedan. Because it was engineered from its top to its tires in the U.S., Toyota is calling the new Avalon its \"most American\" car yet. And as you would expect \"more American\" means it's bigger, roomier and more powerful. Rear passengers even benefit from a flat floor and seats that recline up to 10 degrees. The overall feel is much more upscale than that of your average Toyota car. In the past, the Avalon was so similar to the Camry the price difference was hard to justify. That's no longer the case with the 2006 Toyota Avalon, which offers more room, more power and more luxury than any Camry owner could imagine. If you're shopping for a full-size sedan, you owe it to yourself to try an Avalon. If relaxation and refinement are high on your list, Toyota's big sedan won't disappoint. The front-wheel-drive Toyota Avalon is powered by a 3.5-liter V6. With an output of 268 horsepower and 248 pound-feet of torque, it makes the Avalon as powerful as an Infiniti G35 sport sedan and indeed Toyota's full-size sedan needs just 6.9 seconds to reach 60 mph. A five-speed automatic transmission handles the shifting duties. In spite of its big power, the Avalon earns an impressive EPA rating of 22 mpg city, 31 mpg highway. Side airbags for front-seat passengers are standard, along with side curtain airbags for front and rear passengers and a driver-side knee airbag. Traction and stability control systems, along with a BrakeAssist system that detects emergency braking and applies maximum pressure to reduce stopping distances, are optional. All Toyota Avalon models have four-wheel antilock disc brakes. In IIHS testing, the Avalon earned a top score of \"Good\" for its protection of occupants in frontal and side-impact crashes. As full-size sedans go, the 2006 Toyota Avalon is rewarding to drive. Not surprisingly, it really shines on the open highway. The cabin remains quiet, the V6 engine has plenty of passing power and the suspension, even with the firmer underpinnings of the Touring package, never feels harsh. The Avalon is no athlete, but this Toyota car carries itself with a great deal of composure on winding roads. Additionally, a tidy turning radius makes it feel unexpectedly nimble on tight city streets. The XLS and Limited models are modern and luxurious (with gorgeous faux maple trim in the Limited), while the sporty Touring model is intentionally austere with black leather seats and a three-spoke steering wheel. The instrument cluster is highlighted by glowing Optitron gauges surrounded by chrome rings, and movable panels that conceal the radio and navigation controls give the dash a sleek look. The front seats are wide and accommodating. The rear seats are more comfortable than in the previous Avalon, thanks to limo levels of legroom and a manually reclining back cushion. A 6-footer can sit in back with more than enough knee and headroom, and with a near flat floor, getting three across on carpool day is no problem. A large sedan, the Toyota Avalon, is available in four trim levels: XL, Touring, XLS and Limited. Although it's the base version, the XL still offers such amenities as electroluminescent gauges, a cabin air filter, a nine-speaker stereo, automatic climate control, a tilt/telescoping wheel, a power seat and 16-inch alloy wheels. The Touring model is noticeably sportier with a firmer suspension, unique 17-inch wheels, leather seats and aluminum interior trim. The XLS and Limited are more upscale; the XLS adds a power moonroof and a six-disc CD changer. The Limited includes such items as rain-sensing wipers, perforated leather seats with memory, heating and cooling, wood grain trim, a power rear sunshade, a keyless startup system and a 12-speaker, 360-watt JBL stereo. Options include a navigation system and laser-based adaptive cruise control.",

    "full_description": "There were no significant changes made to the 2008 Toyota Corolla. The 2008 Toyota Corolla is a vice-free economy car with decades of good reliability. Unfortunately, it costs too much and has all the personality of an almond white Frigidaire. The Jeopardy! category is \"Car Pourri,\" and the answer is \"This is the best-selling nameplate in automotive history.\" If you replied \"What is the Beetle?\" then you just lost $400. Meanwhile, the 9th-grade English teacher from Dubuque, Iowa, successfully answered, \"What is the Toyota Corolla?\"That's right, the 2008 Toyota Corolla is the latest incarnation of the world's number-one nameplate of all time. While it doesn't have the cultural or historic significance of previous record-holders, the VW Beetle and Ford Model T, the Corolla has quietly been an automotive phenomenon. Despite selling about 200,000 units every year in the United States, the Corolla nevertheless manages to blend into the automotive background with plain-Jane styling and personality. This Toyota economy car is about getting from point A to B reliably, year after year, with little worry and minimal spectacle. Sort of like that trusty Frigidaire in the kitchen.Yet this appliance personality that has proved so successful is also what keeps the 2008 Toyota Corolla far from being our top choice in the economy sedan segment. (Its relatively high price is another big factor.) Although 2003 doesn't seem like that long ago, all of the Corolla's competitors have been replaced since then and it's rapidly feeling long in the tooth. Specifically, the recently redesigned Honda Civic has differing model styles, cutting-edge styling, more available convenience features and more power, while offering nearly equal fuel economy and reliability.An all-new Corolla was delayed after its initial design was apparently deemed too plain in contrast to the Civic. The re-penned version is supposed to arrive for the 2009 model year. We would suggest waiting for this 10th generation to arrive if you're one of the 30 million people who have purchased a Toyota Corolla since 1967 and must have a new one. Otherwise, taking a close look at its many impressive competitors is a smart move. Power for all 2008 Corollas comes in the form of a 126-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. A five-speed manual transmission driving the front wheels is standard, and a four-speed automatic is optional. Fuel economy is at the very top of the economy sedan segment (neck and neck with the Civic) with 2008 EPA figures of 26 mpg city and 35 mpg highway with the automatic transmission. The 2008 Toyota Corolla offers antilock brakes, full-length side curtain airbags and front-seat side airbags as optional features. A stability control system that also adds traction control and brake assist is optional on S and LE models equipped with an automatic transmission and ABS. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, the Toyota Corolla earned five stars (the best score possible) for frontal-impact protection and four stars for side-impact protection. In 40 mph frontal-offset crash testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), it received a \"Good\" rating (the highest possible). The IIHS gave a worst rating of \"Poor\" to the Corolla for the car's protection in side-impact crashes. That rating rises to \"Acceptable\" if the car is equipped with the optional side and side curtain airbags. From a stop, the Corolla's acceleration is acceptable but nothing more. During highway driving, it's a quiet cruiser, with very little engine noise and even less wind noise. Though not as sporty as some competitors, this Toyota offers an appealing compromise between handling and comfort. It rides smoothly enough to be used as a commuter car, while maintaining its composure when occasionally pushed around the corners. The Corolla's interior is furnished with high-quality materials and user-friendly controls that wouldn't seem out of place in a more expensive car. In fact, its build quality is better than the latest Camry -- especially in uplevel LE trim. However, unlike the Civic or Mazda 3, no one will ever call the Corolla's design particularly dynamic or interesting. Even with the car's tall cabin, room in the front seats is only average, with a somewhat awkward seating position for the driver. On the plus side, two adults can sit comfortably in the backseat without ducked heads or pulled-up legs. Trunk capacity measures a generous 13.6 cubic feet. The 2008 Toyota Corolla economy sedan is available in three trim levels: CE, S and LE. The base CE comes with 15-inch steel wheels, air-conditioning, a CD player, power mirrors, a height-adjustable driver seat, an outside temperature gauge and a 60/40-split folding rear seat. The S is similar but has a lower-body styling kit, a rear deck spoiler, foglights and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Go with the Corolla LE to gain fake wood trim, Optitron gauges, power windows and locks, and remote keyless entry. You can get the power windows and locks as options on the CE and S. Other available options, depending on the trim level, include 16-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof, upgraded audio systems and cruise control.",

    "full_description": "Despite  a handful of updates over the years, the Toyota Tundra is one of the oldest  vehicles on sale in America today. When the current Tundra debuted in 2007, it  was a compelling alternative to the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado and Ram  1500. And while we still like some things about the Tundra \u2014 the  standard V8 engine, roomy interior and decent list of driver aids \u2014  there isn't much else to separate it from the crowd. And all of its competitors  have seen at least one full redesign since 2007.  Toyota  has made only minor changes to the Tundra for 2021, with a pair of new special  edition models that focus on changes to the truck's styling rather than  improvements to features. Overall, we think it's worth taking a closer look at  the competition from Ford, Chevrolet, Nissan and Ram. The  midlevel SR5 trim is the way to go.  It has a handful of upgrades over the base model and is available with a number  of options including the off-road-focused TRD Sport package. How does the Tundra drive? The 5.7-liter V8 has plenty of thrust, but that's about the best thing we can say about the Tundra's performance. The brake pedal is numb and provides little driver confidence during emergency braking. Around corners, the steering is vague and the large steering wheel doesn't return to center well. Handling feels unsettled at times too, especially on tight roads.     We do like that Toyota offers the off-road-ready TRD Pro version. But for routine driving, nearly every full-size truck is more agile, maneuverable and modern. How comfortable is the Tundra? Comfort is below average in the Tundra. The seats are stiffly padded and aren't very supportive \u2014 most drivers will have issues getting comfortable. The Tundra rides OK over small ruts, but you'll definitely feel larger bumps and potholes because of the stiff and unforgiving suspension. We imagine a significant payload would settle things down a bit, but it's hard to live with every day. Wind and road noise is present most of the time.     Our SR5 test vehicle didn't have many creature comforts, but the single-zone climate control is easy to master because of its logical layout and big, easy-to-grasp knobs. The small vents mean you have to crank up the A/C to cool down the cabin in a hurry. How\u2019s the interior? The Tundra's interior is functional but dated. The controls are large and well labeled, and the redundant buttons next to the touchscreen are useful. It's spacious inside too, with enough room for adults in all the major seating positions.     Forward visibility is good. However, there's a huge blind spot over both shoulders, and the blind-spot monitoring system doesn't always detect what's back there. The lack of visibility also makes maneuvering into a parking spot a challenge. How\u2019s the tech? Technology is a weak point for the Tundra. The base stereo is an underpowered six-speaker unit that doesn't get very loud. And when you turn it up, it distorts easily. At least Bluetooth and USB audio connect relatively quickly on a consistent basis.    The factory voice controls for music and phone calls work well but only under a very specific menu structure \u2014 the system doesn't respond well to casual language. On the plus side, the Tundra comes standard with features such as adaptive cruise control, automated emergency braking and lane departure monitoring. On the minus side, some of these systems are overly sensitive to neighboring vehicles. How are the towing and storage? The max payload rating for the Tundra is competitive, but the bed's load-in height is high. You can't get a fancy tailgate like you can on some of the newer trucks either. Thankfully, the 5.7-liter V8 and standard 4.30 axle ratio give most Tundras a tow rating around 10,000 pounds. Plus, the Tundra comes standard with an integrated electronic trailer brake controller.    The back seat is massive, so you can fit most child seats without a problem. But it's poorly laid out for hauling large cargo items because of a sizable hump in the center of the floor. Small-item storage is lacking because many of the spaces are small by segment standards. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Tundra's EPA ratings are well below average. The six-speed automatic holds it back, as does the standard high axle ratio. Other truckmakers hide the negative effects of towing axle ratios by making them optional, but at least with them, you get the choice. As a silver lining, we've found the EPA estimates to be achievable in real-world testing. Is the Tundra a good value? For a bare-bones work truck, the Tundra has some appeal. But when you start adding options, the pricing becomes less competitive. Almost every rival packs better bang for the buck. The cabin materials feel cheap and dated, even if the tolerances are tight.     The standard three-year/36,000-mile warranty and five years/60,000 miles for powertrain coverage are about average for the segment. Scheduled maintenance and roadside assistance for two years/25,000 miles are on the house, which is nice. What the Tundra lacks in objective performance metrics, it makes up for with a bit of personality. The 5.7-liter V8 gives you a great soundtrack, and any of the off-road packages will make you feel like a hero in the dirt. Plus, no matter where you go or what you do, this big Toyota won't let you forget that you're driving a brute-force pickup, not some compromised daily driver.",

    "full_description": "For 2016, the Toyota Highlander Hybrid carries over unchanged. The 2016 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a family-friendly three-row crossover that gets an unbeatable 28 mpg in mixed driving, but the up-front price might be a bit tough to swallow. It's a simple law of physics, at least in the era of steel  and aluminum: The bigger and heavier the car, the worse the gas mileage. This  basic principle isn't going to change any time soon, but there are ways to  reduce the effects of weight on the mileage equation. That's where the 2016 Toyota Highlander Hybrid comes in.\nFor families that don't need a V8 toy-hauling behemoth or can't  bring themselves to own a minivan, the Highlander Hybrid represents the current  apex of three-row crossover size, utility and fuel efficiency. It offers a  spacious, comfortable and quiet cabin, seating for seven and high-quality  materials and finish. The hybrid gas-electric V6 engine delivers quick  acceleration when called upon, smooth and quiet cruising, and at 28 mpg  combined, unsurpassed fuel economy. By comparison, gasoline-only V6 Highlanders  are rated at 20 mpg combined.\n\nIt may look like a  standard Highlander, but the Highlander Hybrid delivers considerably better  mileage in day-to-day driving.\nSo why isn't every family driving one? Because starting at  almost $50,000, the Highlander Hybrid is a fairly rich taste for such a  blue-collar brand. The Hybrid comes in just two top trim levels, Limited and  Limited Platinum. Those trim levels are certainly well-equipped with leather  upholstery, navigation, smartphone integration and a premium sound system, but  even compared to the gas-only Highlander versions, they'll cost you a premium  of several thousand dollars when new. The Hybrid rivals many luxury brands for  the price.\nStill, those who can stomach the cost will find the  Highlander Hybrid worth it, which is essentially what we concluded in our Edmunds  \"A\" rating of this Toyota. You'd have to stretch to the Infiniti QX60 Hybrid to find a  crossover of equal size with a bit more refinement, luxury trimming and similar  price, but slightly less fuel-efficient (26 mpg combined) and much less  powerful (250 horsepower compared to the Highlander Hybrid's 280 hp).\nIf seven-passenger seating isn't a requirement, buyers can  consider the more luxury-focused Audi Q5 Hybrid or  Lexus RX 450h. There's no doubt, though, that the 2016 Toyota Highlander Hybrid  offers the best combination of fuel efficiency, power, comfort and interior  space in its class. The 2016 Highlander Hybrid is powered by a 3.5-liter V6  combined with multiple electric motors and a battery pack. Total output is  rated at 280 hp. All-wheel drive is standard, as is a continuously variable  automatic transmission (CVT). Under normal conditions, the hybrid is driven by  its front wheels. But if a wheel begins to slip or the driver demands serious  acceleration, the rear axle's electric motor kicks in for full traction and  power.\n\nThe \"Eco\"  gauge on the left is one of the few hints that this vehicle uses a gas-electric  drivetrain.\nIn Edmunds testing, a Highlander Hybrid accelerated from  zero to 60 mph in just 7.9 seconds. That's quick for a crossover of this size, let  alone a hybrid version. Fuel economy is an EPA-rated 28 mpg in combined driving (27 city/28 highway), which is about as good as it gets for a three-row  crossover.\nA properly equipped Highlander Hybrid can tow up to 3,500  pounds, or 1,500 fewer than the conventional Highlander V6. The 2016 Toyota Highlander Hybrid comes standard with  stability control, antilock disc brakes, hill-start assist, front-seat side  airbags, a driver knee airbag, a front passenger seat-cushion airbag and  full-length side curtain airbags.\nA rearview camera and blind-spot monitoring system with rear  cross-traffic alert and rear parking sensors are also standard, while the  optional Driver Technology package adds a frontal collision mitigation system  with automatic braking, lane-departure warning and Toyota's Safety Connect  telematics (emergency assistance, stolen vehicle location and automatic  collision notification).\nIn Edmunds testing, the Highlander Hybrid came to a stop  from 60 mph in 127 feet, which is a few feet longer than average for the  segment.\nIn government crash tests, the Highlander Hybrid earned five  out of five stars for overall crash protection, including four stars for  total frontal-impact safety and five stars for total side-impact safety.\nIn crash testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway  Safety, the non-hybrid Highlander received the highest possible rating  of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and  roof-strength tests. In the small-overlap frontal-offset test, it received the  second-highest rating of \"Acceptable.\" Its seat and head restraint  design was rated \"Good\" for whiplash protection in rear impacts. On the road, the Highlander Hybrid definitely feels large,  but still easy to drive every day. The 280-hp hybrid system offers quick  acceleration in city traffic and the V6/CVT combination gives it some real pep from  a standstill. As with most hybrids, the regenerative braking system produces a  characteristically odd pedal feel that may strike some drivers as a little  touchy until they've acclimated.\nIt's worth noting that the Highlander Hybrid is around 350  pounds heavier than a comparable gas-only model. Nonetheless, the hybrid  confidently handles the road within its predictably modest limits. The steering  has a firm, reassuring feel as well, but can be a bit heavy during slow-speed  maneuvers.\nOf course, most people will use the 2016 Highlander Hybrid primarily  for ferrying passengers around in comfort, and that's where it truly shines.  The cabin remains impressively quiet at speed, and bumps and ruts are generally  shrugged off by the crossover's compliant suspension. Some hybrid vehicles have unique interior flourishes setting  them apart from their non-hybrid counterparts. But aside from the usual  smattering of hybrid-specific gauges and information screens, the 2016 Toyota  Highlander Hybrid is basically a Highlander Limited with a different  powertrain.\nWhile this may disappoint some, especially considering the  Highlander Hybrid's significantly higher starting price, the interior is nice  enough to pass muster. Supple surfaces cover the dashboard with subtle  stitching at the seams. The Infiniti QX60  Hybrid's cabin might look and feel more special, but Toyota's modest  deficit here shouldn't be a deal-breaker.\n\nThe interior is nicely  trimmed and designed for maximum practicality.\nToyota has baked a number of handy storage features into the  2016 Highlander's interior. There's a unique built-in shelf on the  dashboard, for instance, that can serve as a resting place for phones and other  small personal items. The shelf's short height, however, can make it hard to  actually fit your hand in there to place or retrieve those items. Vastly more  spacious is the storage box under the console armrest that's big enough for a  large purse. A 120-volt power outlet and a 12-volt power source in the second  row also offer flexible options for charging devices and gadgets.\nThe Hybrid only comes in Limited trim, so it doesn't offer  three-passenger seating in the second row like non-hybrid Highlanders, only  dual captain's chairs. The chairs are quite pleasant however, and slide far  forward to offer good access to the third row. Adults will still find the third  row cramped relative to other competitors, but kids will do just fine, and the  three-across seating bolsters the Highlander's credentials as a minivan  substitute.\nBehind that third row are nearly 14 cubic feet of  cargo-carrying capacity, which when the rear seats are lowered maxes out at  83.2 cubic feet, an average figure for this class of vehicle. The available  height-adjustable power liftgate with memory height settings is also a boon in  garages with low ceilings.\n\nThere's plenty of  available cargo space if you don't need to carry any passengers. \nStandard features include 19-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof, roof  rails, LED running lights, foglights, a flip-up rear hatch window, an  adjustable-height power liftgate, a rear spoiler, keyless ignition and entry,  ambient interior lighting, tri-zone automatic climate control, leather  upholstery (with synthetic SofTex vinyl for the third row), heated and  ventilated front seats, an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar), a leather-wrapped  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, driver memory functions, a four-way power  passenger seat, driver voice amplification for communicating with rear  passengers (\"Driver Easy Speak\"), a second-row table between the  captain's chairs and retractable second-row sunshades.\n\nThere are only two  trims levels of the Highlander Hybrid, so expect to pay well north of $40,000  to get your hands on one.\nElectronics features include a navigation system, a  blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert, rear parking  sensors, a back-up camera, an 8-inch central touchscreen, smartphone app  integration (Entune App Suite), Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity and a  12-speaker JBL audio system with satellite radio, HD radio and iPod/USB  connectivity.\nOptional for the Limited is the Driver Technology package,  which adds Toyota's Safety Connect telematics (stolen vehicle locater, roadside  assistance, automatic collision notification), adaptive cruise control, a  collision mitigation system with automatic braking, a lane departure warning  system and automatic high-beam control headlights. A rear-seat Blu-ray  entertainment system with a 9-inch display is offered as a stand-alone option.\nThe Highlander Hybrid Limited Platinum (also known as the  Platinum package) includes all those items plus a panoramic sunroof, a heated  steering wheel and heated second-row seats.",

With its cavernous interior and bevy of available comfort  and convenience features, the modern minivan is second to none as a family  hauler. The Toyota Sienna has long been one of the segment's most capable  picks, and last year, it got a top-to-bottom redesign that makes it even more  compelling.\nRelative to the previous generation, the current 2012 Toyota  Sienna presents buyers with a wider range of choices. It can be had with a  four-cylinder engine for those who want higher fuel economy, and there's the SE  trim level with a sport-tuned suspension for more responsive handling. Other  highlights include a split-screen video monitor for the rear-seat entertainment  system and available recliner-style seating for the second row.\nThe Sienna also has a smooth ride and a quiet cabin in its  favor, and the available V6 brings spirited acceleration. All-wheel drive is  offered, a plus for those who frequently slog through rain and snow; the Sienna  is the only minivan to offer this feature. Another bonus is the Sienna's  ability to seat up to eight passengers.\nOf course, the minivan segment boasts some impressive  choices. Our other top choice is the talented Honda  Odyssey, whose wide,  uniquely configurable second-row seat adds an extra measure of versatility. You  might also want to look at the Dodge Grand Caravan and the Nissan Quest.  Still, the 2012 Toyota Sienna is an ideal match for many on the strengths of  its overall competence and unique mix of features, engines and trim levels. Base and LE models come with a 2.7-liter inline-4 that makes  187 horsepower and 186 pound-feet of torque. Available on those two trims and  standard on all others is a 3.5-liter V6 with 266 hp and 245 lb-ft of torque.  Both engines come matched to a six-speed automatic transmission. The Sienna LE, XLE and Limited V6 models can also be had  with all-wheel drive.\nIn Edmunds testing, we timed the V6 (in front-drive Limited  trim) from zero to 60 mph in a swift 7.9 seconds. The EPA fuel economy  estimates come in at 19 mpg city/24 mpg highway and 21 mpg combined for the  four-cylinder Sienna. Notably, the V6 gets pretty much the same numbers with  18/25/21 ratings. Opting for all-wheel drive drops the Sienna to 17/23/19. Antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control,  front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, a driver-side knee  airbag and active front head restraints are standard on all 2012 Toyota Sienna  models. A pre-collision warning system and hill start assist are optional on  the Limited. At our test track, a Sienna Limited stopped from 60 mph in 127  feet -- about average for the minivan segment.\nIn government crash testing, the  Sienna received an overall score of four stars (out of five). It got three  stars for overall frontal crash protection and five stars for overall side  crash protection. In tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the  Sienna earned a top score of \"Good\" for its performance in  frontal-offset, side-impact and roof-strength crash tests. We've long favored the Sienna's V6, which has the juice to  deliver lively acceleration. The 2.7-liter four-cylinder is smooth and quiet,  with enough punch to deal with traffic and freeway cruising with two  people aboard; however, its thrust tapers off when it's faced with steeper  inclines, quick merging or a full load of passengers. The smart six-speed  automatic does a great job at keeping the four-cylinder peppy, but the  downside of this powertrain is that the fuel economy isn't any better than the  V6's.\nThe 2012 Toyota Sienna's ride quality is plush, and handling  is competent in all versions. The SE, due to its recalibrated suspension,  provides more agile handling with a somewhat firmer (though still comfortable)  ride quality. The steering is typical Toyota, meaning precise if somewhat numb,  though the SE offers a meatier feel in the wheel. Lower trim levels of the Sienna are attractively decked out  with high-quality fabric upholstery, while higher-end models get leather along  with somewhat unconvincing faux-wood cabin accents. Some of the plastics feel a  bit downmarket, though, while others -- such as the intentionally  rough-textured plastic on the dash -- are just plain odd. Seating is plush,  there's abundant space for storage and the Sienna's controls are user-friendly.  The available rear seat entertainment system has a split-screen monitor that  allows two different media (e.g., a movie on one side and a video game on the  other) to play simultaneously.\nWith a seven-passenger Sienna, you get second-row captain's  chairs that tip up to allow easier access to the third row; these chairs also  have a long-slide  feature  to maximize legroom for taller passengers. However, the seats do require a fair  amount of effort to slide, and removing them is a job best left to two people,  as they are rather heavy and awkward. The eight-passenger version comes with a  40/20/40-split second-row bench whose center section slides close to the front  seats for easier access to the little one seated there.\nChoose a model fitted with the lounge seats and second-row  passengers get to recline in La-Z-Boy-style comfort, provided those seats are  slid back far enough (and the front seats are up far enough) to allow the  footrests to come up all the way. With the second-row seats out and the third  row stowed, the Sienna provides a massive 150 cubic feet of maximum cargo  capacity. \nThe base  Sienna includes 17-inch alloy wheels, sliding rear doors with power-down  windows, triple-zone air-conditioning, full power accessories, a telescoping  steering wheel, cruise control and a four-speaker sound system with a CD player  and an auxiliary audio jack. The four-cylinder LE adds privacy glass, heated  side mirrors, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, floor and overhead  consoles and an eight-way (manual) driver seat. The LE V6 adds a roof rack,  power-sliding side doors, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, power lumbar  supports (front seats), second- and third-row sunshades, a 3.5-inch display  (includes a back-up monitor), Bluetooth (phone and streaming audio) and a  six-speaker sound system with satellite radio and an iPod/USB interface.\nThe  sport-themed SE is equipped similarly to the LE V6 but adds more aggressive  styling via 19-inch alloy wheels, a unique front fascia (with foglights, mesh  inserts and a larger air intake), lower body skirting and tinted head- and  taillights. The SE also has firmer suspension tuning, revised power steering  and a power liftgate. Inside the SE are leatherette/cloth upholstery, unique  instruments, triple-zone automatic climate control and a leather-wrapped  steering wheel.\nThe Sienna XLE reverts back to the  LE but features a unique metallic-gray grille insert, automatic headlights, a  sunroof, a tow prep package, leather upholstery, wood-grain interior trim, power  driver and passenger seats, heated front seats and auto-up/down power windows.  The AWD version of the XLE also comes with second-row lounge seats that feature  pop-up footrests.\nThe plush Limited features 18-inch  alloy wheels, a satin chrome grille, power-folding side mirrors (with  auto-dimming, signal repeaters and puddle lamps), dual sunroofs, front and rear  parking sensors, keyless ignition/entry, two-tone leather seating, driver  memory settings, a leather-and-wood steering wheel, an upgraded 10-speaker JBL  surround-sound audio system, second-row lounge seats and a power-folding/split  third-row seat.\nOptions on the Toyota Sienna are  grouped into packages that vary based on trim level and buying region. Notable  highlights include xenon headlights, rain-sensing wipers, adaptive cruise  control, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system with a large screen that can be  split to display two different sources and a navigation system with a back-up  camera.",

    "full_description": "The 2004 Toyota Prius is completely redesigned with a larger overall size, more power, better mileage and even more available features. The 2004 Toyota Prius is a full-featured midsize family sedan that just happens to be the most fuel-efficient and earth-friendly sedan on the market as well. The fact that it starts at just $20K makes it all the more attractive. The Prius wasn't the first hybrid car on the market, but with four doors, a sizable trunk and room for four, it was the first such vehicle to offer the practicality of a typical economy car along with the outstanding fuel mileage of a hybrid. The second-generation model delivers all that and more, with an even larger interior, hatchback utility, new interior features and a hybrid drivetrain that's more powerful and cleaner than the previous version. For the uninitiated, a hybrid drivetrain uses a small gasoline engine in conjunction with an electric motor to provide power while keeping emissions and fuel usage to a minimum. Under full acceleration, both motors work together to provide maximum power, but under lighter load conditions, such as stop-and-go traffic, the Prius alternates between the two, oftentimes running purely on battery power alone. A regenerative braking system converts energy normally lost as heat into electricity to charge the car's batteries, so the Prius never has to be plugged in. A dashboard monitor allows you to see which engine is doing the work, and how much energy is being used at any given time, among other things. Toyota calls the Prius' latest drivetrain a Hybrid Synergy Drive. Although it works in much the same way as the first-generation model, it delivers considerably more power with fewer emissions. Toyota claims that its exhaust emissions have been reduced by 30 percent over the previous model, allowing it to earn both SULEV (Super Ultra Low-Emission Vehicle) and PZEV (Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle) ratings. With a combined city/highway rating of 55 miles to the gallon, the 2004 Toyota Prius is the most economical midsize sedan on the road. Despite its miserly fuel ratings, the Prius can still accelerate to 60 mph in a respectable 10 seconds. Apart from its high-tech drivetrain, the Prius offers comfortable accommodations for four adults. It's a little smaller than most midsize sedans, but even taller passengers have enough room in the rear seats. Improved interior materials and a unique design give the cabin an alternative look and feel, but all the features you would expect are there. Newly available options include a keyless ignition system, a DVD-based navigation system and xenon headlights. Its hatchback design makes loading larger items into the cargo a snap, and with 16.1 cubic feet of space, there's nearly as much room in the trunk as in a Camry. Unlike the original version that was more science experiment than economy car, the all-new Prius is a legitimate family sedan that offers everything you would expect -- like solid build quality and refinement -- and a few things you don't -- like a base price of just $20,000. Add in the eye-popping mileage and long list of standard features, and it's easy to see why the 2004 Toyota Prius will be one of the most talked about cars of the year. There is only one engine and transmission combination available. The Hybrid Synergy Drive power plant consists of a 1.5-liter gasoline engine and a single electric drive motor. The gas engine produces 76 horsepower and 82 pound-feet of torque while the electric motor generates the equivalent of 67 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. An electronically controlled continuously variable transmission is standard on all models. Toyota claims a 0-to-60 time of 10 seconds and mileage ratings of 60 city/50 highway due to the car's improved efficiency during low-speed operation. All models come standard with four-wheel antilock brakes, multistage driver and front passenger airbags and traction control. Electronic stability control and side-impact/side-curtain airbags are optional. As you might expect, the 2004 Toyota Prius is no speed demon, but when it comes to the kind of daily driving that most drivers encounter, there's more than enough power to get around. The continuously variable transmission (CVT) takes some getting used to since it doesn't use traditional gears, but it does make the best use of the hybrid drivetrain's power. Cabin noise is minimal and the suspension is comfortably soft without feeling too floaty. The lightweight body doesn't feel as rock solid as a Camry, and the driving position can be a bit awkward for some, but the overall comfort level is comparable to most other sedans in its class. Many of the design cues found in the original Prius have been carried over, but the overall look is more upscale than before. Materials quality has been improved and the addition of metallic accents on the vents, center console and doors brightens things up a little. The gauge cluster is still positioned toward the center of the dashboard, but the display is now larger for easier viewing. The optional DVD navigation system is not only Toyota's most comprehensive system ever, it can be voice operated as well. Another option, the Smart Entry and Start system, unlocks the car when it senses the transmitter in your pocket. Once inside, you merely press the start button and you're off. The 2004 Toyota Prius is available as a four-door hatchback only. There is only one well-appointed trim level, but several new options are available. The standard features list includes power windows, locks and mirrors; air conditioning; a tilt steering wheel with satellite audio and climate controls; a six-speaker CD stereo; cruise control; trip computer; and 15-inch aluminum wheels. Options like a DVD-based navigation system, Bluetooth hands-free phone technology, keyless entry and ignition and a JBL premium audio system with a six-disc CD changer are also available, along with an auto-dimming mirror, rear wiper and xenon headlights.",

    "full_description": "The 2016 Toyota Mirai is an all-new model. The 2016 Toyota Mirai is a comfortable, high-tech sedan with more range than any plug-in electric vehicle, but its hydrogen fuel-cell power system limits initial availability to certain regions of California. If Toyota has its way, the 2016 Mirai hydrogen fuel-cell car  could go down in popular history as the car that brought the future to us. Its  name, after all, means \"the future\" in Japanese. Forget the Prius,  the Tesla Model S and the BMW i3, Toyota executives say; the Mirai and its  hydrogen fuel-cell technology is the first step in the next century of the  automobile.\n\nIf you ask Toyota, the  2016 Mirai signals that the future is now.\nThe beauty of hydrogen  fuel-cell cars is that they deliver all of the benefits of electric cars without  being limited by a charging cord. The all-new 2016 Toyota Mirai sedan seeks to  optimize this formula, promising a fuel-cell system that is lighter, smaller  and less expensive than anything that's come before it. On the road, the Mirai  delivers 300 miles of range, putting most plug-in electric cars to shame.\nAt the moment, however, the future is mostly confined to California,  where the majority of just a handful of current public  hydrogen stations are located. So it is with the 2016 Mirai, which is only  available in the Golden State. Toyota says it has plans to sell the Mirai in the Northeast, too, pending the construction of new  hydrogen stations between Massachusetts and New Jersey. But for the time being,  California residence is a must for Mirai ownership.\nIf you've got that part down, and you're not overly  concerned about hydrogen  fuel safety (you shouldn't be), this Toyota is certainly a car worth  considering. One question, of course, is how you feel about the polarizing  exterior styling. Toyota designed the Mirai to stand out from the crowd, and it  does so with a daring shape marked by radical angles, scoops, curves and accent  lines. Inside, the Mirai's spaceship-like instrument layout makes another  strong impression. There are just four seats, though; engineers decreed that  the added weight of a fifth passenger would hurt both range and performance, so  there's no middle seat in the back.\nIf you want your next car to have \"hydrogen\"  written all over it, the Mirai is pretty much without competition. The only  other fuel-cell vehicle in the retail market right now is the California-only Hyundai  Tucson FCEV, and supplies are very limited. Honda plans to launch its own fuel-cell sedan sometime in  2016, but the next batch of fuel-cell vehicles will require a longer wait. For  now, at least, the Edmunds  \"B\" rated 2016 Toyota Mirai is indeed \"the future\" of hydrogen-powered  cars. Driving the front wheels of the 2016 Toyota Mirai is a front-mounted  electric motor that delivers 151 horsepower and 247 pound-feet of torque. A Prius-sized  1.6-kWh nickel-metal hydride battery mounted behind the rear seats stores some  of the juice generated by the fuel-cell system for use when an extra burst of  power is needed.\nIn Edmunds track testing, a 2016 Mirai accelerated from zero  to 60 mph in 8.7 seconds, beating the 2016 Prius by 1.1 seconds. Top speed is  111 mph. Toyota says the Mirai can travel about 300 miles on the 5 kilograms  (11 pounds) of pressurized hydrogen it carries. With 1 kilogram of hydrogen  delivering the same amount of energy as a gallon of regular gasoline, that's a  fuel-efficiency equivalent of 60 mpg. Standard safety equipment on the 2016 Mirai includes  antilock disc brakes, traction and stability control, front and rear side  airbags and a rearview camera. Active safety equipment includes lane-departure  alert, a blind-spot monitor, adaptive cruise control and a frontal collision mitigation  system with automatic braking. Special hydrogen sensors will issue warnings and  shut down the hydrogen tanks' stop valves if they detect a hydrogen leak.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, a 2016 Mirai stopped from 60 mph  in 130 feet, a longish distance that's nonetheless not unusual among hybrids  and EVs. Ride quality in the 2016 Toyota Mirai is smooth and comfortable.  Thanks in part to the weight of the low-slung fuel-cell stack, the Mirai feels secure  around the turns. Steering and suspension feedback are pretty numb, but this  isn't a car you buy for the thrill of tearing through corners or dancing along  tortuous mountain routes.\nAs in any electric car, all of the 2016 Toyota Mirai's  torque is available as soon as you start pressing the accelerator, so the car feels  rather quick from zero to 40 mph. Things slow down after that, so acceleration during  highway passing can be relatively sluggish, but we suspect most drivers will be  just fine with the Mirai's level of performance.\n\nSome might find the  2016 Mirai's styling a bit too adventurous, but it certainly stands out in a  crowd.\nThe brakes feel firm and sure, though, and while the Mirai's  rather mild regenerative braking system won't let you slow the car almost to a  dead stop without applying the brake pedal (as is the case with some electric  cars), it also won't alarm you with an abrupt jerk when you lift off the  accelerator pedal.\nWithout the background noise of an internal combustion  engine, the Mirai's cabin remains fairly quiet. At lower speeds, the clicking  hydrogen injectors, humming hydrogen pump and whining air compressor are faintly  audible, but never intrusive. Toyota lavished Lexus-like quality on the Mirai's cabin,  with soft-touch materials at all the places where people come into contact with  interior surfaces. Fit and finish is excellent. The instrumentation and  controls are generally user-friendly, although the instrument panel can take a  little getting used to, as it floats directly above the center stack on the top  level of the Prius-like two-tier dash. There's nothing behind the steering  wheel where the gauges usually reside.\n\nThere's a lot going on  with the 2016 Mirai's dashboard.\nThe supportive front seats are roomy but still grippy, and  there's plenty of head-, leg- and hiproom in all four seating positions. A  large armrest with an integrated storage bin separates the heated rear seats. On  the downside, the center console's storage compartments are fairly small, and  the expanse of glossy plastic surrounding the climate controls is a magnet for fingerprints.\nBecause the car was designed from the start to be a  fuel-cell vehicle, the bulky fuel tanks and battery don't intrude much into  either cabin or trunk space. The Mirai's trunk isn't as large as that of most  conventional cars its size, but it's still roomy enough to handle typical  chores like grocery shopping or runs to Target. \nAn official list of features was not available as of this  writing, but we expect standard equipment on the 2016 Mirai to include 17-inch  aluminum wheels, LED headlights, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate  control, neoprene-look cloth upholstery, eight-way heated power front seats  with power lumbar adjustments, heated rear seats, a heated tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, an 8-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, a navigation system  with a fuel-station finder, Bluetooth audio and phone connectivity and a JBL audio  system with satellite radio, a USB port and an auxiliary jack.\n\nThe Mirai's standard  equipment list appropriately includes a number of high-tech items, including an  8-inch touchscreen interface.\nAlso standard are a 24-hour concierge service, 24-hour  roadside service, three years of free maintenance and an 8-year or 100,000-mile  warranty on all fuel-cell system components.\nThe sole option is a trunk-mounted power take-off system  that enables the Mirai to serve as an emergency generator, providing up to 60  kilowatt-hours of electricity from a full load of hydrogen, sufficient to power  a small home for up to a week, Toyota says.",

    "full_description": "Toyota  redesigned the Corolla last year, giving this typically competent but dull  small sedan a much-needed upgrade. The new Corolla gained a considerable amount  of style without losing the high levels of comfort and efficiency it's known  for.  \nChanges  are few for the 2021 Toyota Corolla. The biggest one is the new Apex Edition.  This trim level's upgraded suspension, as well as optional sticky summer  performance tires, should liven up the Corolla's handling. Overall, the Corolla  is worth considering alongside other top-rated rivals such as the Honda Civic,  Kia Forte and Mazda 3.  The  Corolla is a model of affordability and efficiency. But for a small price  increase over the base L or LE trim level, we'd take the SE trim. We like the more powerful engine and its longer list of  standard features. It also gives you more flexibility for adding options. How does the Corolla drive? Acceleration is a bit underwhelming for the class (0-60 mph took 8.8 seconds in our testing), which means you'll likely be flooring the pedal when getting onto highways. Passing slower traffic requires a little extra planning and a heavy foot. Emergency braking performance is adequate, however, and braking force is easy to control for smooth stops.\n\n   We tested the Corolla XSE, which is supposed to be the sporty trim level. Alas, we quickly discovered that it's not that sporty. It leans a lot when you go around turns, and its tires don't offer much grip. But as a routine daily driver, the Corolla does just fine. It's easy to maneuver around town, and the operation of its continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) is generally unobtrusive. How comfortable is the Corolla? The Corolla's ride quality is smooth over a variety of road surfaces, and the front seats are comfortable.\u00a0 Whether you're tall or small, there are enough adjustments and sufficient range within those adjustments to find your preferred position. We do prefer the cloth seats since they breathe better than the available simulated leather on hot days.\n\n   Road noise is ever present. It gets so loud on the highway that you'll have to crank the stereo to overcome it. The engine sounds labored under hard acceleration, but the continuously variable transmission's simulated gear changes help reduce the droning sound that is otherwise typical for a CVT. How\u2019s the interior? The Corolla's interior benefits from a simple, easy-to-use layout. The controls are right where you want them and are logically grouped. The number of buttons is sensible, with just enough to be useful but not so many that it looks cluttered.\n\n   It's also easy to get in and out of the car. Front passengers have plenty of room, and the driver has clear sight lines to both the front and rear. Seating for rear passengers is tighter, especially with regard to headroom. Adult occupants' heads might be close to the roof. The Honda Civic is better in this respect. How\u2019s the tech? Toyota's recent infotainment systems have never managed to win us over, but this latest version is a marked improvement. That said, it's still not as intuitive or visually appealing as rival systems. Thankfully, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now both standard. \n\n   Many advanced safety features are included as part of the standard Toyota Safety Sense suite, and almost all are well tuned to be as unobtrusive as possible. The lane departure warning system is the outlier, and it can be oversensitive and annoying with its frequent beeping. The adaptive cruise control is praiseworthy for its smooth braking and acceleration. How\u2019s the storage? The Corolla has a slightly smaller trunk (13 cubic feet) than its primary competition. And it should still be enough for typical use. Unfortunately, the rear seatbacks don't fold flat with the trunk floor, which could complicate loading longer and bulkier cargo. \n\n   Storage for personal items is also on the small side. There are just enough places for your phone and the like, but many competitors give you more. On the plus side, there seems to be ample space for infant and child safety seats. The clearly marked car seat anchors should help with installation. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA rating for the Corolla XSE with the 2.0-liter engine and CVT automatic (the car we tested) is 34 mpg in combined driving (31 city/38 highway). That's a strong showing from what is the most powerful engine in the Corolla lineup. On our 115-mile evaluation route, the Corolla easily exceeded that estimate, returning an impressive 40.2 mpg.\n\n   The less powerful 1.8-liter engine is rated at 33 mpg combined. For the ultimate in mileage, check out the Corolla Hybrid. Is the Corolla a good value? The Corolla is competitive against the top entrants in the small sedan class. The cabin is upscale and is solidly put-together. Toyota's reputation for reliability figures into most shoppers' decisions, but there are other aspects to consider. You also get two years of free scheduled maintenance, which is unusual in this class. The latest Corolla brings a fresh and modern style without unnecessary trinkets and vents. It's also more enjoyable to drive than before, but other sedans in the class are noticeably more entertaining. The overarching themes are capability and competence.\n\n   The sleek and modern styling of this current generation makes the previous Corolla seem generic by comparison. The more aggressive body treatments for the XSE trim make it even more attractive.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota 4Runner has revised exterior styling for 2006, highlighted by new bumpers, lamps, grille and lower cladding. There are also new 18-inch alloy wheels for the Limited model and a new roof rack and tube steps for the Sport Edition. Toyota has also thickened the 4Runner's windshield and front window glass for reduced wind noise. In terms of new standard features, there's now an auxiliary audio jack for portable devices and power seating for the Sport and SR5 V8, and a seat memory feature and a six-disc CD changer for the Limited. Highly capable whether on the pavement or in the dirt, the 2006 Toyota 4Runner is a well-rounded midsize SUV, and one of our favorites. Redesigned for 2003, the Toyota 4Runner is now in its fourth generation, and that says a lot about the popularity of this midsize Toyota SUV. With rugged good looks and true off-road capability, the 4Runner has earned a reputation as a stout no-nonsense sport-utility vehicle. While other SUVs in its class have evolved into kinder, gentler versions of their originals, the 4Runner has retained much of its truckish character. This might seem like a misguided philosophy when you consider that few SUV owners actually go off-road, but Toyota looks at the situation a bit differently. It sees the 4Runner's all-terrain capability as a selling point over its rivals. If you want a \"soft roader,\" there are plenty to choose from (the Toyota Highlander being a convenient suggestion). But if you want a real sport-utility vehicle, the Toyota 4Runner is still the real deal. This body-on-frame SUV has two available engines: a 4.0-liter V6 or a 4.7-liter V8. There's a decent amount of cargo room with a maximum capacity of 75 cubic feet, but the Toyota 4Runner still lags behind the competitors in this regard. Toyota isn't completely oblivious to this fact as the company offers a foldable cargo shelf that allows for two-tiered loading. Those hoping for a third-row seat are in luck, as it's optional, but the bad news is that it doesn't fold flat into the floor unlike in the Explorer, Pathfinder and Durango. Overall, the 2006 Toyota 4Runner stacks up favorably against just about any other midsize sport-ute on the market when it comes to creature comforts and standard equipment. Add in the powerful engines, advanced vehicle control systems and stout underpinnings, and there's little doubt this Toyota SUV upholds the legacy of the numerous 4Runners before it. The Toyota 4Runner is available with either two- or four-wheel drive and one of two engines. The standard 4.0-liter V6 makes 236 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque. The optional 4.7-liter V8 generates 260 hp and 306 lb-ft of torque. All 4Runners get a five-speed automatic transmission. Towing capacity is 7,300 pounds on V8 models, while V6 models top out at 5,000 pounds. Toyota 4Runner models come with standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes with BrakeAssist (BA) and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD). Stability control (called VSC) is also standard. Optional on all models are front-seat-mounted side airbags and overhead side curtain airbags for first- and second-row passengers. In government crash testing, the 4Runner earned four out of five stars in the frontal-impact category and a perfect five stars for side impacts. In IIHS frontal-offset testing, the 4Runner received a \"Good\" rating, the highest. Both engines move the 4Runner out quickly; although the V8 is a must if you plan on doing any serious towing, most buyers will be happy with the less expensive and more fuel-efficient V6. When driven on pavement, the 2006 Toyota 4Runner delivers a smooth, controlled ride, and handling around turns is surprisingly tight and responsive for a traditional body-on-frame sport-ute. Taken off-road, this Toyota SUV is right at home, tackling steep passes with little drama. The Toyota 4Runner offers roomy quarters for four to five passengers, plus a couple extra kids if you opt for the 50/50 third-row seat. To make way for cargo, each half of the third-row seat can be stowed in an upright position along the sideboards or removed completely, but it does not fold flat into the floor. The overall design of the interior is both aesthetically pleasing and seriously functional with most controls easy to find and use. Our only major ergonomic complaint concerns the climate controls, which look like intuitive dials but work more like joysticks. Maximum cargo capacity is 75 cubic feet, which trails behind most of the 4Runner's midsize competitors. The four-door Toyota 4Runner comes in three trim levels: SR5, Sport and Limited. Standard features on the base SR5 include 16-inch wheels, automatic climate control with rear vents, a CD player, remote keyless entry, a power driver seat, a telescoping steering wheel, cruise control, a trip computer, running boards and full skid plate protection. Stepping up to the Sport Edition adds larger 17-inch wheels, X-REAS shocks (which reduce body roll in turns), a hood scoop, color-keyed exterior mirrors, a power driver seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with stereo controls and high-contrast seat fabric. High-dollar Limited models pick up illuminated running boards, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery and heated front seats. Options include a DVD-based navigation system, a rear-seat entertainment system and a third-row seat. The X-REAS shocks are optional for the Limited and come with a height-adjustable rear air suspension.",

    "full_description": "After being fully redesigned last year, the Toyota Tundra enters 2008 with only minor changes, such as the expansion of the base \"Tundra Grade\" trim to all body styles and additional standard features for the SR5 and Limited trim levels. A top choice for a full-size pickup, the 2008 Toyota Tundra gets it right in terms of performance, work ability, road manners and available configurations and equipment. When we first heard about the completely redesigned, second-generation Toyota Tundra -- the bigger, tougher successor that was going to give the big T something serious for the full-size pickup segment -- we could picture the scene. The old Wild West gunfight-about-to-happen music plays as the Tundra rolls to a stop somewhere in America's heartland. The dust settles, a tumbleweed rolls by. But instead of Gary Cooper or Clint Eastwood, a Ford F-150 appears opposite the Toyota and growls: \"You're not from around here, are you?\"No, it isn't. Well...OK, the Tundra is built in America, but it's still the offspring of a Japanese company. And judging by the positive reviews, strong work capacity and respectable sales numbers, it looks as if the Tundra is here to stay. After that successful reincarnation last year, the Toyota Tundra rolls into 2008 with only minor changes. These consist of expanding the base Tundra Grade trim level to the Double Cab and Crew Max body styles, and adding standard features for the SR5 and Limited trim levels.Its 7/8ths scale predecessor was fine for light recreational or home improvement store errands, but not up to the heavier stuff due to a smallish V8 and low tow rating. The current Tundra, on the other hand, is ready for most any task. With a stout frame, three cab sizes, three bed lengths and three engines (including a potent 5.7-liter V8), the 2008 Toyota Tundra stands on equal footing with all of the traditional Big Three pickups. In fact, the Tundra CrewMax has the roomiest crew cab in the full-size segment, besting even Dodge's Mega Cab in this regard.If you're shopping for a full-size half-ton pickup truck, the Tundra should be on your list. It's fully capable of handling heavy work (its maximum towing capacity is more than 10,000 pounds), is pleasant to drive and comfortable to ride in. Compared to its toughest half-ton rivals, the GM twins (Silverado and Sierra), the Tundra doesn't hold any significant advantages, and indeed its cabin isn't as nicely furnished as the top trims in GM's trucks (although lower trims are comparable). Apart from that minor quibble, we'd have to say that you won't go wrong if you choose to pick up this pickup. Three engines see duty in the 2008 Toyota Tundra. Standard on the Tundra Regular Cab and standard-bed Double Cab is a 4.0-liter V6 rated for 236 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque. Optional on these models and standard on all other Tundras is a 4.7-liter V8 with 271 hp and 313 lb-ft. Optional on all Tundras is the muscular 5.7-liter V8 that pumps out 381 hp and 401 lb-ft. A five-speed automatic transmission comes with the base V6 and 4.7-liter V8, while the 5.7 V8 is paired with a six-speed automatic. With the big V8, the Tundra is seriously quick -- a Double Cab Limited 4WD we tested sprinted to 60 mph in just 6.3 seconds.All versions of the Tundra can be equipped with two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, and all trucks come with a limited-slip rear differential. Properly equipped, a 4x2 Tundra Regular Cab can tow up to 10,800 pounds. Antilock disc brakes, traction control, stability control, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags are all standard. In government crash testing, the Tundra scored four stars (out of five) in frontal impact tests for both driver and passenger. In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's frontal offset crash testing, the Tundra earned a \"Good\" rating, the highest possible. Equipped with the 5.7-liter V8, the 2008 Toyota Tundra is incredibly powerful and the engine's delivery is impressively smooth. Shifts from the six-speed automatic transmission are prompt, and the console shifter's precise action allows drivers to easily use the manual mode while tackling steep highway grades or rugged off-road situations.Like most of today's half-ton trucks, the Tundra provides a smooth and quiet highway ride, although trucks with the off-road package tend to feel choppy over rain-grooved expressway pavement. Light, precise steering makes for easy maneuvering in parking lots, but some buyers may find it a bit too light at highway speeds. Handling is predictable around corners, with minimal body roll, though the Tundra doesn't hold a significant advantage over its competitors in this area. Braking performance is a strong point, as the Tundra has a firm, progressive pedal feel and respectable stopping distances, with minimal fade under heavy use. Inside the Tundra, it's obvious that the designers placed their emphasis on utility and durability. The ample front seats are accommodating, the storage areas and cupholders are generous in size, and build quality is tight. Soft-touch surfaces are rare, however, and as a result there is a large amount of hard plastic trim. The attractive gauges are not as easy to read as they could be, due to the individual binnacle design. And although the center stack controls are large and well organized, they're quite a stretch to reach from the driver seat, especially in Tundras equipped with the navigation system.The Regular Cab offers comfortable seats as well as a generous amount of interior cargo space. In Double Cabs, the backseat is fully usable for adults, while the CrewMax offers the roomiest rear seat of any pickup truck. With a limolike 44.5 inches of rear legroom, even 6-footers can stretch out and cross their legs. Trim levels include the base Grade, midlevel SR5 and plush Limited. The standard-cab truck comes only in the Grade trim, while the Double Cab and CrewMax are available in Grade, SR5 and Limited versions. Standard features on the Grade include 18-inch steel wheels, a 40/20/40 cloth bench seat, dual-zone air-conditioning and a four-speaker CD stereo with an auxiliary audio jack. The SR5 adds an extra pair of stereo speakers, cruise control, full power accessories, keyless entry, a telescoping steering wheel and rear heater ducts. In addition, the Double Cab and CrewMax trims add power front bucket seats, a six-CD changer and heated sideview mirrors, while the CrewMax also gets rear A/C ducts, a reclining rear bench seat and a sliding rear window with a defroster.Tundra Limited models add alloy wheels, slightly wider tires, a bed rail system with adjustable tie-downs, front and rear park assist, leather upholstery, front captain's chairs with 10-way power adjustment for the driver, automatic climate control, a 10-speaker (12 in CrewMax) JBL sound system, Bluetooth and power-retractable, auto-dimming sideview mirrors.Major options include a navigation system, a backup camera, driver seat memory, 20-inch wheels and, on the CrewMax only, a sunroof. The TRD Off-Road Package features an upgraded suspension with Bilstein shocks, BFGoodrich all-terrain tires and foglamps. An appearance package that consists of monochromatic styling elements is available for Regular and Double Cab models.",

    "full_description": "For 2009, the Toyota Avalon gets a few more standard safety features, as stability control and active (whiplash-reducing) headrests come on board. In other news, the Touring trim level is dropped and the audio systems are now satellite-radio-ready. Its price of entry may be higher than its rivals', but if you're looking for the most refined, best-built full-size sedan in the $30,000 price bracket, you need look no further than the 2009 Toyota Avalon. These days, the large sedan is often overshadowed in terms of popularity by an even bigger vehicle, the crossover sport-utility. But there's still something to be said for a vehicle that doesn't have to claim it has \"carlike\" handling and fuel economy. It's been a car since day one. So for those who realize that a spacious yet fuel-efficient sedan can make more sense than a bulky, thirsty SUV, something like a 2009 Toyota Avalon should work out nicely.Although it rides on a stretched version of the previous-generation Camry platform, the Avalon is still quite a bit larger than even the current Camry. The Avalon's architecture allows a virtually flat rear floor, so three adults can sit back there in comfort. And being Toyota's flagship sedan, the Avalon offers premium cabin design and features. Opt for one of the elegantly finished upper trims fitted with niceties such as heated/cooled seats, and you'll think you somehow ended up inside a Lexus.One thing you might notice lacking is a V8 option. No worries there, as the Avalon's potent V6 and responsive six-speed automatic make it one of the quickest big sedans in this price range. And these qualities, along with a quiet and composed ride, make the 2009 Toyota Avalon an excellent choice for a road trip.In terms of competition, the Avalon is worlds better than the ancient Lincoln Town Car and Mercury Grand Marquis. The Toyota is also more refined than the spacious Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable twins and the high-value Hyundai Azera. It's a tougher call against the new Hyundai Genesis V6, which offers loads of space, luxury equipment and performance for a reasonable price. Also, if they're looking for sporty handling, buyers eager for back-road travel will probably find the Chrysler 300 or Pontiac G8 more to their liking. The front-wheel-drive Toyota Avalon is motivated by a 3.5-liter V6 rated at 268 horsepower and 248 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard.The EPA's fuel mileage estimates for the Avalon stand at 19 mpg city/28 highway and 22 combined, making it one of the most fuel-efficient full-size sedans available. Standard safety equipment on the 2009 Toyota Avalon includes antilock disc brakes, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and a driver-side knee airbag. This year, stability and traction control and active front headrests are also standard.In government crash tests, the Toyota Avalon earned a perfect five stars in all frontal- and side-impact categories. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Avalon earned the top score of \"Good\" for its protection of occupants in frontal-offset and side-impact crashes. Not surprisingly, the 2009 Toyota Avalon is at its best on the open highway. The cabin remains quiet, the ultra-smooth V6 engine has plenty of passing power and the suspension swallows up road imperfections without drama. The Avalon is no athlete, but this full-size Toyota carries itself with reasonable composure on winding roads. The steering is too light to feel sporty, but it responds to driver input in a precise, fluid manner. Additionally, a tidy turning circle makes the Avalon feel unexpectedly nimble on tight city streets. Any Toyota Avalon feels upscale and inviting, thanks to its glowing Optitron gauges, attractive and ergonomic control layout and high-quality materials. Movable panels conceal the radio and navigation controls when they're not in use, and this gives the dash a sleek appearance.The front seats are wide and accommodating, particularly in the Limited, which offers both ventilated seats and a seat-cushion length adjuster. The rear seats are quite comfortable as well. Legroom is abundant even by full-size sedan standards, and the rear seats boast a manually reclining back that allows those passengers to stretch out on long trips. A 6-footer can sit in back with more than enough knee- and headroom, and with a nearly flat floor, getting three into the backseat on carpool day is no problem. One minor annoyance is the inability to fold the rear seats (the trade-off for the reclining feature). The trunk measures 14.4 cubic feet, smaller than what's available in other full-size sedans. Many of the upscale features on the XLS and Limited are also available as options on the XL. Other options, depending on trim level, include a navigation system, an upgraded power passenger seat and laser-based adaptive cruise control.",

    "full_description": "We  wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people still think hybrid cars are dorky  looking and cheap-feeling. But this same group of people would likely be  shocked by the 2021 Toyota Avalon Hybrid. It's roomy, comfortable and upscale,  just like you'd expect an Avalon to be, and on top of that it gets up to an  EPA-estimated 44 mpg. That's almost double the fuel economy from an Avalon a  decade ago.  \nThis  latest-generation Avalon came out for 2019 and the 2021 car is largely  unchanged. In-car tech is improved with the addition of Android Auto and USB-C  ports for charging and connectivity. Toyota says it also replaced the hybrid's  previous nickel-hydride battery pack with a new lithium-ion one, though the  powertrain's power and fuel economy are unchanged. Overall, we think the hybrid  is the best version of the Toyota Avalon. Find out why by reading our Expert  Review. The  Avalon is a little more upscale than the typical midsize sedan (Toyota's own  Camry, for example). As such, the best way to maximize this distinctiveness is  to go with the top-line Limited. Its  extra touches such as authentic leather and wood make it our pick of the bunch.  The price increase from a regular Avalon Limited to an Avalon Hybrid Limited is  less than $1,000 too. How does the Avalon Hybrid drive? The Avalon Hybrid makes the most of its available power. The continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) is responsive when you step on the gas pedal, even when you select the Eco drive mode. We recorded a 0-60 mph time of 8.2 seconds in Edmunds testing. That's slower than a typical V6-powered large sedan, but we think most buyers will find this acceptable for the considerable gains in fuel economy.\n\n   The braking feels natural in most situations thanks to an imperceptible transition from regenerative to regular brakes. We measured a panic-stop performance from 60 mph of 126 feet, which is around the class average, though the sounds our test car made in the process were a bit more alarming than usual. Despite its luxury cruiser attitude, the Avalon Hybrid is surprisingly fun to drive around tight corners and maintains its composure surprisingly well. How comfortable is the Avalon Hybrid? All-around comfort is the primary reason you'd consider a sedan like this, and the Avalon Hybrid delivers. The ride is cushy without feeling buoyant like some rivals. The seats are welcoming too, with soft leather and compliant cushions. Our Limited trim test vehicle had heated and ventilated seats and a heated steering wheel, all of which worked well. The rear outboard seats are also heated in the Limited.\n\n   Like most hybrids, the Avalon isn't immune to the shudder that passes through the cabin as the gasoline engine fires up. The hybrid system can also produce some low-volume but high-pitched whirring noises while the car is stopped. How\u2019s the interior? The Avalon's interior is a pleasant place to spend time in, though there are some faults. Some controls and buttons are out of reach or hard to find, especially the ones near your left knee. The Avalon also sits rather low, which may present a problem for passengers who are less limber. We're also not enamored with its size. Despite being more expensive, the Avalon isn't much larger than a Toyota Camry, and there's less rear headroom due to the Avalon's raked roof.\n\n   Otherwise, the Avalon's cabin is quite nice. Most drivers will find an agreeable position since the steering wheel and driver's seat both offer a useful range of travel. Rear visibility is good overall, though the rear shelf is high. How\u2019s the tech? The Avalon infotainment system now features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There are plenty of USB ports plus an optional wireless charging pad. Passengers jockeying for a free port is effectively a thing of the past.\n\n   The touchscreen has a bright, attractive display and an easy-to-use integrated navigation system. As with most systems, you cannot enter a new address while moving. For that, you have to use the voice command system, which is frequently confused and has limited point-of-interest search.\n\n   Most of the Avalon's driving aids are standard and work well, though adaptive cruise control has a tendency to leave a large gap between you and the car in front. How\u2019s the storage? Most big sedans have a cavernous trunk, and the Avalon Hybrid is no exception. In fact, the trunk is the same size as the regular Avalon's \u2014 16 cubic feet. The rear seats can fold down to increase cargo space.\n\n   Interior storage is similarly generous, at least for those in front. The center armrest is as roomy as one you'd find in an SUV, and there's a nicely sized bin in front of the shifter, which also houses the wireless charging pad. The door pockets aren't large, which limits storage in the back, but overall it's quite good.\n\n   The car seat anchors and generous interior space make loading a child seat a breeze. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Avalon Hybrid Limited is rated at 43 mpg combined (43 city/44 highway). It's a little thirstier than midsize sedans such as the Honda Accord Hybrid (48 mpg combined) and the Camry Hybrid (up to 52 mpg combined), but it's far more efficient than the standard Avalon V6 (25 mpg). Is the Avalon Hybrid a good value? Though the Avalon Hybrid has some hard touch points, its interior materials are a clear step above those in the Camry. There are even a few surprises in the form of premium-looking quilted stitching on the seats and doors.\n\n   The Avalon Hybrid is only marginally more expensive than an identically equipped Avalon, though a similarly equipped Lexus ES 300h doesn't cost too much more. The basic and powertrain coverage is average for the class. Toyota also offers free scheduled maintenance for your first two visits. You'll be impressed by how enjoyable the Avalon Hybrid is to drive. Handling is composed, even though grip is ultimately low, and body roll is well controlled. The only real downside is the powertrain's slowish acceleration.\n\n   Is there personality here? No, not really. Other than the oversized front grille, the Avalon is conservatively styled and accomplishes exactly what you'd expect.",

    "full_description": "The  Corolla Hybrid returns after last year's grand debut, equipped with the hybrid  powertrain from the Prius to bring extra efficiency to Toyota's popular small  sedan. How much efficiency? How does 52 mpg in combined city/highway driving  sound? That's one of the highest figures you'll find. For 2021, the Corolla  Hybrid is functionally the same, though it now comes with Android Auto  smartphone connectivity.  \nThis  is the least expensive hybrid vehicle in Toyota's lineup and consequently lacks  some of the nicer features found in its Prius and Toyota Camry Hybrid  relatives. But it delivers exceptional fuel economy and offers you an  alternative to the Honda Insight, which is Corolla Hybrid's most comparable  rival. Consider the Corolla Hybrid a strong option for affordable and  economical transportation. You  only have one choice in the 2021 Corolla Hybrid, and it's the LE trim. This is a pretty basic  package, and we would add the optional blind-spot monitor with rear  cross-traffic alert for additional protection. Aside from that, pick your paint  color and interior color and you're on your way. How does the Corolla Hybrid drive? The Corolla Hybrid provides respectable power and smoothness during low-speed acceleration. You won't have any trouble keeping pace with city traffic. Acceleration is somewhat lacking once you're trying to get to freeway speeds quickly (0-60 mph took a slow 10 seconds in our testing), but that's typical for fuel-sipping cars like this one.\n\n   Around turns, the Corolla Hybrid is stable, though the economy-biased tires don't offer up much grip. The main drawback is an abrupt and grabby brake pedal feel at low speeds. It's more of an annoyance than anything else, but it makes the hybrid hard to stop smoothly. How comfortable is the Corolla Hybrid? The Corolla Hybrid's ride quality is well controlled. It's smooth without being overly isolating or floaty. Less appealing are the front seats. They feel cushy when you first sit on them, but they lack the support and adjustability needed to make long drives tolerable. As for noise, the hybrid is generally quiet, though the engine can sound unpleasant when you get hard on the gas. \n\n   Owing to the hybrid's fuel-conscious intentions, the climate control system offers an Eco setting that improves efficiency. You can use this setting for temperate days, but you'll want to switch it off if you are dealing with truly hot or cold days. Otherwise, the system just can't keep up. How\u2019s the interior? The Corolla's interior isn't fancy but it's thoughtfully designed. The main controls are clearly labeled and easy to find without taking your eyes off the road. We also like the driving position. The sight lines are clear to the instruments as well as to the front, rear and sides. \n\n   While the front seats have plenty of space, the rear is more restricted, especially with regard to headroom. Taller adults will have to duck while getting in and out, and they'll find their heads close to the roof when seated. How\u2019s the tech? The main infotainment display is adequate but lacks navigation and arbitrarily locks out certain features when you're moving, which is a source of constant frustration. Apple CarPlay is supported and works as expected, and Android Auto connectivity comes standard too. Toyota's Entune app is a poor substitute when it comes to features and functionality. The integrated voice controls are effective in understanding most commands, though you still need to navigate through prompts to accomplish tasks. You're better off with your phone. \n\n   Standard safety features, such as adaptive cruise control, are impressive for the price. Alas, this system isn't smooth at low speeds, so you won't want to use it in stop-and-go traffic. How\u2019s the storage? Storage options are average overall, and you can find more accommodating cars for the money. The rear seats fold easily but not flat. Instead, they create a shelf of sorts that partitions the trunk from the cabin. This feature could be helpful for securing items that fit, but it could be annoying if you want a flat loading surface. The center console compartments can handle a phone and wallet or small purse but not much else.\n\n   Fitting child safety seats in the rear is easy thanks to visible and easily accessible lower car seat anchors underneath plastic flaps. The upper tethers are easy to find too. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA rates the Corolla Hybrid at a combined 52 mpg, which matches the fuel economy of the main versions of the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight. During our 117-mile evaluation route, which covers highway, country roads and city streets, our test car returned 58 mpg. Is the Corolla Hybrid a good value? The Corolla Hybrid delivers a lot of value because of its low pricing and respectable number of standard features. Most of the interior looks and feels appropriate for the price, but the overall design appears a bit higher-class. On top of that, you get two years of free maintenance and roadside assistance without a mileage restriction. \n\n   If you're content with the base car's offerings, you'll be happy. But there are no additional trim levels or options, so those seeking quality-of-life upgrades \u2014 such as premium sound, leather or superior phone connectivity \u2014 will need to look elsewhere because the Corolla Hybrid is only offered in the LE grade. Handsome exterior styling helps the new Corolla break away from the boring look and feel of previous versions. Still, you can't help but feel like you're driving an appliance. The Corolla Hybrid dutifully tackles the daily grind without complaint. Alas, the characteristic hybrid drone of the engine at high speeds, the light steering feel, and the ho-hum acceleration ensure there's simply nothing to enjoy about the experience of driving.",

    "full_description": "The  2019 Toyota Camry Hybrid is one of the most desirable hybrid sedans on the  road. Some might even say that the hybrid version of this popular family sedan  is more appealing than the standard gasoline-powered model.  Redesigned  last year, the Camry Hybrid is full of modern touches, including a powertrain  that now dominates the class for fuel economy. EPA fuel economy estimates for  the Camry Hybrid are as high as 52 mpg combined, a number previously reserved  for small hatchbacks such as the Toyota Prius. And while the Camry Hybrid  certainly isn't a sports car, its acceleration might surprise you. In our  tests, the Hybrid zipped from 0 to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds, which is quicker than  the standard gasoline-only Camry. Inside,  there's plenty of room and comfort for adults. We also like that safety  features such as adaptive cruise control, forward collision mitigation and lane  keeping assist are standard across all trim levels. The Camry's infotainment  system can be a bit annoying to use, but Toyota has added Apple CarPlay and  Amazon Alexa (no Android Auto yet) to the mix this year, which should help out  a little. There  are some other appealing hybrid sedans. The Accord Hybrid, in particular, is a  capable rival that has some slight advantages in handling performance and  infotainment features. Overall, though, we're quite fond of the 2019 Toyota  Camry Hybrid. It's an enjoyable car with lots to offer. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of theToyota  Camry LE Hybrid (2.5L 4-cyl hybrid | CVT automatic | FWD).NOTE:  Since this test was conducted in 2018, the current Camry Hybrid has received  some revisions, including the addition of Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa as  standard equipment. Otherwise, the Camry Hybrid is unchanged, so our findings  remain applicable. While 208 combined horsepower might not look too impressive on paper, the Camry Hybrid has more than adequate real-world performance. Passing and merging with traffic are never a concern, and its recorded 0-60 mph time of 7.5 seconds even makes it a tad quicker than a regular four-cylinder Camry. The brakes are a mixed bag. Under most conditions, they feel smooth and predictable, but the transition between regen and mechanical braking becomes clumsy in stop-and-go traffic. The low-rolling-resistance tires diminish panic-braking performance; our test stop from 60 mph covered 128 feet. The steering is accurate, and the ratio is quick enough to make low-speed maneuvers a breeze. But there's an overabundance of power assist, so the steering is light and gives you little feel of the road. It's well-mannered within its modest limits since the tires don't have much grip. Still, the Hybrid feels tidy for a car in this class. Body roll isn't excessive when you're going around turns, though the Camry bobs up and down on bumpy, twisting roads more than we'd like. In most situations, you'd be hard-pressed to tell this Camry is a hybrid. The gasoline engine is quiet and quick to rev, and the CVT automatic blends electric and gasoline power with ease and efficiency. Continuously variable gearing helps the cruise control hold speed within 5 mph on downgrades. On first inspection, the seats don't look to be anything special, but they do a good job accommodating different body types. The seats are somewhat wide and somewhat flat. It's easy to get comfortable and stay comfortable. And the LE-level cloth breathes well. The Camry Hybrid LE excels around town, soaking up bumps and broken surfaces with its long travel suspension and generous tire sidewalls. At highway speeds, however, the rear can sometimes feel soft and buoyant. It's not quite floaty, but it's close. Electric takeoffs are, of course, silent, and the engine is less obvious because it joins in later \u2014 though you will hear it zing under heavy throttle application. There's not much in the way of wind or road noise, no matter the speed. The clear and easily understood controls, along with good vent positioning, make for set-and-forget operation. The system handles triple-digit temperatures well, though it takes a bit of time to get cranking. There's nothing confusing about the inside of the Toyota Camry. On-screen menus are easy enough to decipher with one or two uses, and the instrumentation is very readable and efficient with information. The radio volume and tuning knobs are easy for the driver to reach, but they are a bit of a stretch for the front passenger. Generous front and rear door openings mean easy access for most everyone. All the seats are unobstructed by any part of the car, and headroom is never an issue when entering or exiting the vehicle. Drivers of just about any size should be able to find a comfortable driving position. The pedal area is roomy, and the steering wheel has a large degree of usable adjustment. Arms and elbows can find comfortable, padded support or are free to move when turning. Front and rear passengers have ample space around them. Taller drivers won't impinge on rear passenger legroom, and headroom for the rear seat is ample for average-size adults. The front of the cabin is airy and spacious. Thanks to large windows and slim roof pillars, visibility in every direction is quite good. Mirrors, both inside and out, are nicely sized, and blind spots are kept to a minimum. An optional top-view camera system provides a clear and comprehensive depiction of the surroundings. Soft-touch surfaces abound, and they look and feel good. The Camry's design and variety of textures won't be mistaken for those of a luxury car, but they're attractive without sacrificing functionality. Cabin storage is good but not stellar. The forward center console bin is great for concealing items but has a hard, slippery floor, so items slide around noisily. The console bin at your elbow is a decent size, and the modest door pockets in the front and rear are good for small water bottles only. The Hybrid has the same trunk size as any other Camry. Loading most items is easy thanks to a wide opening and a low liftover height. The Hybrid's rear seats fold to expand trunk space even more. It's easy to mount a car seat, with obvious and easily accessible lower anchors and package tray-mounted tether points, both under plastic covers. There's enough space so that the front seat need not be scooted all the way forward. The audio system layout is simple and effective, with chunky, well-labeled buttons and a clear display even in direct sun. However, built-in navigation is hard to get on the Camry. Typically, you either have to use Toyota's Entune-based Scout GPS Link or your iPhone (through Apple CarPlay) to get navigation. Once your phone has the Entune app, the connection is seamless and immediate. Some apps require the phone to be connected with a USB cable. Wireless charging is optional. Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa are standard, but Android Auto is not available. All Camrys come with adaptive cruise, automatic emergency braking and lane keeping assist. Rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, intelligent clearance sonar and blind-spot monitoring are optional. The lane departure warning system's frequent alerts can be annoying on very narrow roads because the system has no off button. Voice controls through the Entune app suite are fairly straightforward and made all the more effective when you follow the voice command setup menu that helps analyze your speech patterns. Siri Eyes Free and Google Voice are also supported. In-car 4G LTE Wi-Fi is available and offered free of charge for the first six months for data up to 2 gigabytes. With  the 2019 Camry Hybrid, the most fuel-efficient trim level is the base LE, and that's the one we recommend.  And the base LE isn't bare-bones by any stretch of the imagination. Interior  features include items such as Apple CarPlay compatibility, heated front seats  and adaptive cruise control. If you're interested in options, the LE has a few  worth checking out, too, such as an upgraded audio system and a sunroof. The LE starts off with features such as  16-inch steel wheels, automatic LED headlights, keyless ignition and entry, a  rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable  driver's seat, and heated front seats. Also standard are a 7-inch touchscreen  interface, navigation (GPS Scout Link), Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa  connectivity, one USB port, Bluetooth, a Wi-Fi hotspot, and a six-speaker sound  system. With its lithium-ion battery, the LE is rated by the EPA at 52 mpg  combined (51 city/53 highway). That's the highest fuel economy rating in the  Camry Hybrid lineup. Standard  on every Camry is Toyota Safety Sense, which is a suite of driver assistance  features including adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with  automatic emergency braking, lane departure alert with steering assistance, and  automatic high beams.Right  in the middle of the lineup is the SE,  which adds 18-inch alloy wheels, sport-themed styling details, a rear spoiler,  simulated-leather upholstery (with fabric inserts), and a leather-wrapped  steering wheel with shift paddles. The SE's nickel-metal hydride battery  contributes to a lower EPA fuel economy estimate of 46 mpg combined (44 city/47  highway). The EPA fuel economy rating is the same on the SE and the XLE.  The XLE Hybrid gets all of the base LE's equipment plus unique 18-inch alloy wheels, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather upholstery, a power-adjustable passenger seat, a head-up display, a larger driver information display, two extra USB ports, a wireless phone charger, an 8-inch touchscreen, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. The  LE and the SE can be equipped with the blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert as extras, and the XLE is available with a top-down parking  camera system and a dynamic navigation system bundled with a JBL premium sound  system. All three trim levels can be had with a sunroof.",

    "full_description": "The popularity of subcompact crossovers  is growing and with the introduction of the Toyota C-HR last year, so, too, are  the choices available to shoppers. In its inaugural year, we noted the C-HR's  sporty handling and generous list of features (including advanced safety  equipment) as some of its strengths. We also pointed out the noticeable absence  of Apple CarPlay, an integrated navigation system and leather upholstery on the  available features list. Well, what a difference a year makes: The 2019 Toyota  C-HR can now be had with all of them.  \nWe're still not fans of the weak engine  and its lazy acceleration, while the lack of an all-wheel-drive option should  continue to be a drawback for those in cold-weather climates. On the whole, the  C-HR's updates for 2019 go a long way. In particular, its new base LE trim  drops the price of admission to be competitive with its chief rivals: the Honda  HR-V, Hyundai Kona and Mazda CX-3. Meanwhile, the top trim gets a new name,  more features and a corresponding bump in price. We noted a higher-than-average base price and the absence of Apple CarPlay, navigation and leather upholstery as drawbacks of last year's Toyota C-HR. Those have all been addressed this year. It's still oppressively slow, but there's a lot more to like about the 2019 model. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based  on our full test of the Toyota C-HR XLE Premium (2.0L  inline-4 | CVT automatic | FWD).\nSince  this test was conducted in 2018, the current C-HR has received some revisions,  including a new base trim, the renaming of the XLE Premium trim to Limited, and  a shuffling of some standard features between models. Our findings remain  broadly applicable to this year's C-HR, however. The C-HR is one of the slowest vehicles we've tested, taking a considerable 10.6 seconds to reach 60 mph. Acceleration is characterized by a long hesitation between a pedal stomp and any forward motion. This is true whether you're stopped or trying to pass slower traffic on the highway. Coming to a stop from 60 mph required 119 feet, which is about average for cars in this class. In panic-braking tests, the C-HR experienced moderate nosedive and some residual bounce, but it tracked straight and remained controllable. In everyday driving, the brakes operate just as you'd expect. There's not much feedback coming through the wheel, but it feels direct and accurate in a sporty kind of way. At parking lot speeds, the effort is appropriately low and weights up as speeds increase. Sport mode makes effort a little too heavy. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that the C-HR can be entertaining to drive on a twisty road, even with a not very powerful engine and a lack of grip from low-rolling-resistance tires. There's noticeable tire squeal under moderate cornering, and the tires really howl when pushed harder. The small footprint and turning radius make it easy to maneuver the C-HR into tight spaces. The transmission works fine, but it's unremarkable. Though the C-HR is classified as a subcompact crossover, the low chin spoiler scrapes on parking blocks and many driveways. Even though the front seats don't come with a lot of adjustments, they offer good padding and support to keep occupants comfortable over several hours. The fabric upholstery also breathes well in hot weather, eliminating the need for ventilation or cooling. For the most part, the C-HR delivers a comfortable ride. Smaller road imperfections are smoothed over as well as they are in other small SUVs, but there's a little jostling over moderate undulations. The C-HR is loud inside. There's a noticeable amount of wind noise, even below highway speeds. Road noise is also excessive, and it increases at higher speeds and over coarse asphalt. The engine drones like a wounded cow under hard acceleration, and we noted an annoying rattle in the back of the cabin. The simple dual-zone climate controls are easy to operate, and the overall system performance is good. Once the system was set, we never felt the need to readjust it. The C-HR's simple layout is attractive, and the main controls are easy to operate for the most part. Some of the more advanced features, such as adaptive cruise control, were a little more difficult to figure out. Some staffers mentioned having to consult the owner's manual. Front passengers have easy seat access afforded by a slightly higher seating position, which makes slipping into the cabin a breeze. There's no climbing up or stooping down. Rear passengers need to dip their heads a little to clear the sloping roofline, a trade-off for the C-HR's sporty styling. The steering wheel doesn't telescope back far enough, even for average-size drivers. As a result, you have to sit closer and more upright than preferred. Drivers smaller of stature should be just fine. There's more interior space than you'd expect from such a small crossover. There's plenty of room up front in all dimensions. The rear seats can indeed hold regular adults in decent comfort. But the thick rear roof pillar and high windows might feel a little claustrophobic. Outward visibility is excellent thanks to the thin and well-profiled front roof pillars. Despite big rear pillars, the rear window is big enough to see all you need. And there's very little guesswork when backing into a space, so you won't have to rely on the tiny rearview monitor. The interior is well-designed and uses quality materials that exceed expectations for the class. Were it not for an annoying rattle in the back of the car, this score could have been higher. LATCH anchors are easily accessed, but a rear-facing child seat will require you to move the front passenger seat well forward. There's an acceptable amount of storage for your personal items, with small door pockets, decent-size cupholders, and a center armrest bin that is about average in size. The typical smart storage solutions that Toyota is known for are absent. With the rear seats in place, you have 19 cubic feet of cargo space, which splits the difference between the C-HR's primary competition. The maximum capacity is 36.4 cubic feet, which is significantly smaller than the space in any other subcompact crossover. The audio system in the C-HR is decent but not at all impressive. It lacks some bass overall, but clarity is acceptable. The touchscreen mounted atop the dash is easy to read at a glance and operate with minimal distraction, too. Apple CarPlay is a welcome addition to the C-HR's features list and is a good substitute for the optional built-in navigation system. We experienced occasional slowdowns in the previous model-year system's response, though. Android Auto is not available. We never had any frontal collision warnings, which either means this driver aid is well-tuned or not working. (We're inclined to think it is working.) The adaptive cruise control works well and operates down to a stop. The native voice controls worked pretty well, but considering that the system only operates the audio and phone, it's acceptable at best. Historically, Apple CarPlay has been easier to use and more accurate, but it requires an internet connection. With  the addition of a new base model and a price increase for the top trim, we  recommend the midrange XLE. The  price jump is reasonable for the convenience, appearance and safety features  you gain. Shoppers in colder climates who want heated seats will have to spring  for the top Limited trim since they're not offered on lower models. \nEvery  C-HR is powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (144 horsepower, 139  pound-feet of torque) matched to only front-wheel drive and a continuously  variable automatic transmission (CVT). Standard features for the base LE trim include 17-inch steel wheels,  automatic headlights, LED daytime running lights, heated mirrors, a rear  spoiler, keyless entry, adjustable driving modes, dual-zone automatic climate  control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, height-adjustable front seats, cloth  upholstery, 60/40-split folding rear seats, a cargo cover, an 8-inch  touchscreen, a rearview camera, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, a USB  port, Apple CarPlay, and a six-speaker audio system.\nSeveral  advanced safety and convenience features are also standard, including automatic  high beams, adaptive cruise control, brake hold at stoplights, lane keeping  assist, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking.\nThe XLE trim upgrades to 18-inch alloy  wheels, power-folding mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, blind-spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert.\nThe  top-of-the-line Limited trim gets  you foglights, automatic wipers, leather upholstery, heated front seats, driver two-way power lumbar adjustment, and an  upgraded infotainment system (optional on XLE) that adds a Wi-Fi hotspot,  remote vehicle controls, and satellite and HD radio. A navigation system can be  integrated into the standard touchscreen only on the Limited trim.",

    "full_description": "A midcycle refresh brings a six-speed automatic transmission (in place of last year's five-speed auto) and minor upgrades to the braking system. All 2008 Toyota Avalons have new headlamps, a revised front fascia and a more compact keyless remote, while the Limited gets chrome door handles. Inside, the wood-grain and metallic surface treatments are updated, while a nine-speaker audio system with an MP3-compatible CD changer and auxiliary audio jack is now standard on all models except the Limited. An eight-way power front passenger seat is included in the XLS and Limited, and the latter also comes with Bluetooth. The price of entry may be high, but if you're looking for the most refined, best-built full-size sedan in the under-$40,000 price bracket, your search should begin and end with the 2008 Toyota Avalon. Although Americans take heat for ordering too many Java Chip Frappuccinos, racking up credit card debt and sustaining the worldwide market for sport-utility vehicles, we have some good habits as well. Driving full-size sedans, for one. As big as these cars are, they're ideally suited for a country where suburban sprawl is rampant and long-distance travel borders on necessity. Further, they typically represent a more efficient solution for carrying four or five people than SUVs. The Toyota Avalon has long been among our favorite large cars in the under-$40,000 price bracket. Not only is it spacious and comfortable, it has a well-deserved reputation for quality and reliability that rivals are hard-pressed to match.Last redesigned for 2005, the Avalon rides on a stretched version of the previous-generation Camry platform. Even compared to the current Camry, the full-size Toyota Avalon is considerably longer and a bit wider. This extra size provides additional legroom and hiproom in the backseat and more than 5 cubic feet of additional interior volume. Plus, Toyota's careful packaging yields a nearly flat floor in the Avalon's rear, making it a legitimate proposition to seat three adults across. In addition to its extra space, Toyota's full-size sedan offers a larger dose of luxury accoutrements. Convincing faux wood trim is sprinkled liberally throughout the cabin, and premium features like adaptive cruise control, heated and cooled seats, and keyless ignition are available. A fully loaded Avalon Limited could easily pass for a Lexus on the inside.Although Toyota has never joined the domestic manufacturers in offering a V8 option, the current Avalon is among the quickest big sedans in this price range, thanks to a very potent 3.5-liter V6. For 2008, Toyota has upgraded the previous five-speed automatic transmission to a new six-speed, the result being minimal gains in acceleration and fuel economy -- which were already above average anyway. These qualities, along with a quiet and composed ride, make the 2008 Toyota Avalon an excellent choice for a road trip. The one thing Toyota's full-size sedan doesn't offer is sporty handling, and buyers who revel in back-road travel will probably find Chrysler's 300 Limited or 300C, or the Nissan Maxima, more to their liking. For consumers who cruise the interstates, though, the Avalon's high level of refinement should more than compensate for its lack of athleticism. The front-wheel-drive Toyota Avalon is motivated by a 3.5-liter V6 rated at 268 horsepower and 248 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard. For 2008, the EPA estimates the Avalon will deliver 19 mpg in the city and 28 on the highway, with a combined average of 22 miles per gallon. Standard safety equipment on the 2008 Toyota Avalon includes antilock disc brakes, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags for front and rear passengers and a driver-side knee airbag. Stability and traction control are optional across the board. In crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Toyota Avalon earned a perfect five stars in all frontal- and side-impact categories. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Avalon earned the top score of \"Good\" for its protection of occupants in frontal-offset and side-impact crashes. Not surprisingly, the 2008 Toyota Avalon is at its best on the open highway. The cabin remains quiet, the ultra-smooth V6 engine has plenty of passing power and the suspension never feels harsh, even with the Touring model's firmer calibrations. The Avalon is no athlete, but this full-size Toyota carries itself with reasonable composure on winding roads. The steering is too light to feel sporty, but it responds to driver input in a precise, fluid manner. Additionally, a tidy turning circle makes the Avalon feel unexpectedly nimble on tight city streets. Although the metallic-trimmed Touring model can come across as a bit austere, any Toyota Avalon feels upscale and inviting, thanks to its glowing Optitron gauges, attractive and ergonomic control layout, and high-quality materials. Movable panels conceal the radio and navigation controls when they're not in use, and this gives the dash a sleek appearance. The front seats are wide and accommodating, particularly in the Limited, which offers both ventilated seats and a seat-cushion length adjuster. The rear seats are quite comfortable as well. Legroom is abundant even by full-size sedan standards, and a manually reclining back cushion allows passengers to stretch out on long trips. A 6-footer can sit in back with more than enough knee and headroom, and with a nearly flat floor, getting three across on carpool day is no problem. One minor annoyance is the inability to fold the rear seats, though the 14.4-cubic-foot trunk offers plenty of usable space. The luxury-themed Avalon XLS loses the HID headlights and reverts to softer suspension tuning but gains lighter-color leather and wood-grain interior trim. Additional standard feature content on the XLS includes a sunroof, an eight-way power front passenger seat, heated outside mirrors and auto-dimming capability for the rearview and driver-side mirrors. The top-of-the-line Limited adds keyless startup; rain-sensing wipers; perforated leather seats with memory, heating and cooling; power-adjustable seat-cushion length for the driver; an upgraded 12-speaker JBL sound system; Bluetooth and a power rear sunshade.Many of the upscale features on the XLS and Limited are also available as options on the lower trims. Other options, depending on trim level, include a navigation system, satellite radio and laser-based adaptive cruise control.",

    "full_description": "The 2015 Toyota Tundra loses its base V6, leaving the two V8s as the only engine options. Also, Toyota has added the off-road-themed TRD Pro trim level to the lineup and will offer an integrated trailer brake controller. The 2015 Toyota Tundra remains a capable workhorse among full-size pickups, and one of the few that is very serious about off-road performance. Unfortunately, it lags behind its American rivals in many respects. After a major face-lift just a year ago, the Toyota Tundra gets  another round of changes for 2015. Toyota updated  the Tundra's styling last year, and this year it eliminated the V6 engine from  the Tundra lineup and added an off-road trim level called TRD Pro. But after  comparing the Tundra with the latest trucks from Detroit, we come away thinking  that the Tundra is still a few updates short of true competitiveness.\nThere's no question that the Tundra is still a seriously  capable truck. No matter which trim level you choose, you'll be getting a V8  powertrain. And when it's properly equipped, the Tundra's tow ratings can match  some of the best in the class. The recent remodel made the interior far more  modern and refined, so if you're looking to be pampered while your truck is  hard at work, the Tundra will satisfy. And if you're looking to go off the  beaten path, then the TRD Pro ranks high, too, as it comes with skid plates, off-road  tires, Bilstein shocks and a raised  suspension -- all of which make it extremely talented when the pavement  ends.\nUnfortunately, the 2015 Toyota Tundra's skills don't extend  much further. When it comes to fuel economy, neither of the available V8  engines are very impressive. While we weren't huge fans of the Tundra's old V6  engine, at least it had one to compete with the surprisingly impressive  six-cylinder base engines offered by its American competitors. Now, you're  stuck with the V8s. There also isn't an alternative such as Ford's turbocharged  V6 engines or Ram's diesel-powered V6.\nThe Tundra's dynamic flaws extend beyond the engine bay. While  traversing broken pavement, the Tundra feels more like the classic, stiff-riding  trucks of the past. Lots of little bumps can be easily felt in the cabin, and  there's a significant amount of road noise along the way. The Tundra may be  capable in the hauling department, but when it's just you and the kids driving  around it feels less refined than competitors.\nAs such, if you're looking for a full-size truck that's more  than just competent, there are definitely some class leaders worth checking out  ahead of the Tundra. The 2015  Ram 1500 is our top-rated truck for its wide range of talents, well-rounded  nature and available diesel engine. Also on our top-rated list are the 2015 Chevrolet  Silverado 1500 and its GM brother, the 2015 GMC Sierra 1500. Both  are comfortable, capable of towing big loads and have respectable fuel economy.  The 2015 Ford F-150 is  completely redesigned and offers its own distinctive engine selection and more  modern underpinnings. While the 2015 Toyota Tundra can hold its own against any  of these, it's hard to make a case that it goes above and beyond any of them. The 2015 Toyota Tundra  is offered with a choice of two V8 engines and rear-wheel or four-wheel drive.\nFor SR double cab models  and all SR5 models, a 4.6-liter V8 comes standard. It is paired with a six-speed  automatic transmission and produces 310 horsepower and 327 pound feet of torque. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 16  mpg combined (15 city/19 highway) on 2WD models; 4WD versions also rate 16 mpg combined (14/18).  Maximum towing capacity with the 4.6-liter engine is between 6,400 and 6,800 pounds  depending on body style.\nA 5.7-liter V8 is  standard on 4WD regular cabs and all Limited, Platinum, 1794 and TRD Pro trims,  and optional on the other models. It generates 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque,  and comes with a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA-estimated fuel economy  is 15 mpg  combined (13 city/18 highway) on 2WD models; 4WD models also rate 15 mpg combined but drop a point on the highway rating. A tow package is standard on all  Tundras equipped with the 5.7-liter V8. When properly equipped (and depending  on body style), maximum towing capacity is between 9,800 and 10,500 pounds. \nIn Edmunds testing, a  Tundra 1794 with four-wheel drive accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 6.8  seconds, while a Tundra TRD Pro did it in 6.7 seconds. These are both quicker-than-average  times for the segment. Standard safety  equipment on the 2015 Toyota Tundra includes antilock brakes, stability and  traction control, trailer sway control, front knee airbags, front side-impact  airbags and side curtain airbags that cover both rows. A rearview camera is  standard across the board, while parking sensors are optional on the Limited  and standard on the Platinum and 1794 Edition. A blind spot monitoring system  with rear cross-traffic alerts is optional on the Limited, Platinum and 1794  models.\nIn government crash tests, the Tundra earned a four  star (out of five) rating for overall safety performance, with four stars  for frontal tests and five stars for side-impact tests. \u00a0The Insurance Institute for Highway  Safety (IIHS) gave the Tundra its best  possible rating of \"Good\" in moderate-overlap frontal-offset,  side-impact and roof-strength tests. Its seat and head restraint design also  received a \"Good\" rating for whiplash protection in rear impacts.\nDuring an Edmunds  braking test, a Tundra 1794 with 4WD came to a stop from 60 mph in 130 feet,  which is about average for the segment. A 4WD TRD Pro took 134 feet, which  isn't much farther, especially considering its all-terrain tires. Despite the 2015 Toyota Tundra's sheer size, nobody's going  to feel sold short by the 5.7-liter V8. It isn't a class leader when it comes  to horsepower, but it remains a champ for towing thanks to its prodigious  torque and well-sorted six-speed automatic. The optional TRD exhaust paired  with the 5.7-liter engine makes for a nice rumble on acceleration, too. Casual  users probably will find the 4.6-liter V8's performance adequate for most  driving situations short of big-time towing, and it provides better fuel  economy -- although neither V8 is a class standout in this department.\nThe Toyota's light but accurate steering makes it fairly  easy to drive on a daily basis, but the Tundra feels bigger and less  comfortable than competing trucks. A major reason we gave the Tundra a \"B\"  rating was its particularly stiff ride over bumps and ruts, especially with  the optional 20-inch wheels. While cruising, it's not very quiet either, which  contributes to the especially trucklike feel you get while driving it. The Tundra is pretty livable  on the inside. Audio and climate dials and buttons are large and easy to reach,  and the instrument cluster features two conventional and legible dials for the  speedometer and tachometer. We wouldn't describe the Tundra's interior as  stylish, but it is definitely functional.\nMaterials and build quality  are acceptable, and the leather appointments in the upper trims are  particularly appealing. One of Toyota's user-friendly Entune touchscreen  interfaces and Bluetooth are standard across the board, and available  smartphone services include features like the Bing search engine, Pandora  streaming radio, real-time traffic and sports and stock information.\nThe front seats in  every trim are broad and comfortable, but as this is a truck, you shouldn't  expect much in the way of lateral support. There's a vast amount of legroom and  headroom in the backseat of the CrewMax, which shouldn't surprise considering  the enormity of this configuration's footprint. The folding rear seats  in double cabs and CrewMaxes also provide a good amount of protected storage  for valuable items you'd rather not leave in the bed.  \nDepending on which  configuration you choose, there are six trim levels for the Tundra: SR, SR5,  Limited, Platinum, 1794 Edition and TRD Pro (late availability). The availability  of some options depends on the region where you live.\nStandard equipment on  the entry-level SR regular cab models includes 18-inch steel wheels, a matte  black lower front bumper, rear bumper and grille surround, tow hooks (four-wheel-drive  models), keyless entry, heated mirrors, full power accessories, a windshield  wiper de-icer, a damped tailgate, cruise control, air-conditioning, cloth  upholstery, a 40/20/40-split bench seat with four-way manual adjustment for the  driver and passenger sections, a tilt-only steering wheel, two 12-volt power  outlets, a rearview camera, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a 6.1-inch  \"Entune\" touchscreen interface and a four-speaker audio system with a  CD player, a USB port, an iPod interface and an auxiliary audio jack. Options  for the base 2015 Tundra include a bed rail system and a Work Truck package  with vinyl seats and flooring.\nGet the SR Tundra in  the double cab body style and you add front and rear map lights, 60/40-split fold-up  rear seats and two extra speakers.\nThe SR5 trim is  available in the double cab and CrewMax body styles. Additional standard  equipment includes foglights, a chrome grille surround, chrome rear bumper,  variable intermittent wipers, a manual sliding rear window (power lowering in  the CrewMax, which also gets an overhead console), a rear underseat storage  tray (double cab only), a higher-resolution 7-inch Entune touchscreen display,  satellite radio and HD radio. The optional SR5 Upgrade package adds front  bucket seats with an eight-way power driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, a front center console, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and an  alarm system. Separately, the TRD Off-Road package adds 18-inch alloy  wheels, all-terrain tires, an off-road-tuned suspension, skid plates, tow hooks  (2WD models) and rear privacy glass.\nThe Limited trim  (available in double cab and CrewMax) adds to the SR5's standard equipment with  20-inch alloy wheels, heated mirrors, a more upscale \"silver billet\"  grille, the bed rail system, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather  upholstery, heated power front bucket seats (eight-way driver, four-way  passenger), a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a horizontal power-operated  sliding rear window (double cab), an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a navigation  system and a smartphone app suite that integrates into the Entune touchscreen.  The Limited Premium option package provides front and rear parking sensors,  one-touch power windows, illuminated entry lighting and a glass-breakage  sensor. \nOpt for the Platinum  trim (available only with the CrewMax cab), and you'll get more chrome exterior  detailing, special 20-inch wheels, LED running lights, power-folding and  auto-dimming outside mirrors, a sunroof, upgraded leather upholstery, heated  and ventilated front seats, a 10-way power driver seat (power thigh adjustment  added), driver seat memory functions and an upgraded 12-speaker JBL sound  system.\nThe 1794 Edition  (named for the Texas ranch on which a portion of the Tundra factory now stands)  is available only as a CrewMax, and adds unique silver exterior details,  saddle-brown leather upholstery with simulated suede trim for the front seats  and matching soft-touch materials for the shift console, door trim and  instrument panel.\nFocused on off-road  ability, the TRD Pro trim is available in double cab and CrewMax body styles,  and it largely mirrors the standard equipment on the SR5 Tundra. To the SR5's  equipment it adds 18-inch alloy wheels, a TRD dual exhaust, Bilstein shocks, a 2-inch  increase in ride height, unique exterior styling details, a front skid plate,  bucket seats with red stitching and the larger 7-inch Entune touchscreen with  satellite radio and HD radio. A spray-in bedliner can also be included on TRD  Pro models as an optional extra.\nOption highlights on  most trims include running boards and extending tow mirrors, while a blind spot  monitoring system with cross-traffic alerts is optional on the Limited,  Platinum and 1794 Edition models. Also available for Tundras equipped with the  5.7-liter V8 is an integrated trailer brake controller (late availability).",

    "full_description": "For 2017, the current-generation Toyota Highlander Hybrid receives its first significant update. Its gasoline engine is more powerful and efficient, and the exterior styling has a fresh look to it. There are also a couple of new, more affordable trim levels this year. Finally, the Toyota Safety Sense suite of accident avoidance features is now standard equipment. Are you  hoping to get high fuel economy from a three-row crossover SUV? You can't do  much better than the 2017 Toyota Highlander Hybrid. It gets close to 30 mpg  while still providing the high levels of comfort and utility that the regular  Highlander is known for. It's a bit expensive, but worth it.  Much like the regular Highlander, the hybrid version  boasts a just-right size that isn't too cumbersome to drive yet still manages a  competitive amount of passenger and cargo space. For 2017, the Highlander  Hybrid's appeal grows due to the addition of entry trim levels \u2014 last  year you could only get the priciest trims. That opens it up to more people,  but it's still quite pricey. When new, a basic Hybrid LE costs thousands more  than the equivalent non-hybrid Highlander. Considering you'd likely save only a  few hundred bucks every year on gas, that math really doesn't add up. But if  you simply like the idea of cutting your carbon footprint but need a family-friendly  vehicle, the Highlander Hybrid is a great way to go.  Are you  hoping to get high fuel economy from a three-row crossover SUV? You can't do  much better than the 2017 Toyota Highlander Hybrid. It gets close to 30 mpg  while still providing the high levels of comfort and utility that the regular  Highlander is known for. It's a bit expensive, but worth it. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions,  although trim levels share many aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the 2014 Toyota Highlander Hybrid  Limited (3.5L V6 hybrid\u00a0|\u00a0CVT\u00a0|\u00a0AWD).\u00a0 NOTE: Since this test was conducted,  the current Highlander has received some revisions, including a new V6 engine,  additional feature content and new, less expensive trim levels. Our findings  remain broadly applicable to this year's Highlander. The 2017 Highlander Hybrid's powerful V6 engine and electric motors, in combination, move it off the line quickly. It's not as quick as the regular Highlander, but acceleration is acceptable. Despite a vague-feeling pedal, the Highlander provides sufficient emergency braking effectiveness and good fade resistance. In daily situations, pedal engagement can sometimes feel awkward. The Highlander's steering is reassuring when cornering and provides straight-line stability on the highway. The steering of other, albeit non-hybrid, SUVs instill more confidence, however, and provide more engagement to the driver. A confident and competent handler, right up to the relatively low limit set by the electronic stability system that really lets you know when you're asking too much of it. Again, others are sharper, but most drivers will find it to be acceptable. This is an easy SUV to drive, even if it can feel a tad large compared to certain non-hybrid competitors. As far as hybrids go, though, the brakes aren't weird, and there aren't any strange sensations that will make you feel as if you're driving a science experiment. There are no low-range gears, and it doesn't have a traditional all-wheel-drive system (the rear wheels are simply powered by a separate electric motor). But its 8 inches of ground clearance, hill hold and hill descent systems, and advantageous approach/departure angles are admirable. Heated leather front seats (XLE and above) are as comfy as furniture and offer tons of adjustment, including extendable thigh support. The second row is firmer but slides and reclines in a wide range. The third row is merely acceptable; some other crossovers have roomier third-row seating. One of the Highlander's best qualities is its ride comfort: The suspension easily absorbs bumps and ruts without feeling like a floating barge. Very few, if any, road irregularities intrude. It's one of the quietest SUVs we've ever measured. An occasional wisp of wind noise is evident on a gusty highway pass. At full throttle, the engine's drone does find its way into the cabin. Some controls, specifically those for the audio system, are located too far away. Otherwise, Toyota's typical array of controls are easy to use. It can be difficult to reach the third row because the second row (be it the captain's chairs or bench) doesn't get out of the way enough to provide the sort of access provided by certain competitors. The doors are large, though, and the seats are of a reasonable height. Abundant seat adjustments, including power thigh support (a rare feature) on most trim levels. Sufficient seat and telescoping-wheel travel for taller drivers. As in its competitors, the first and second rows provide copious room for most occupants. The third row is squishier than those in some rival models despite have three seat belts \u2014 only small kids are likely to fit three abreast back there. The quality of materials is among the class best, and during the course of our one-year long-term test of a Highlander, everything in the cabin remained nicely screwed together. Impressive. There's a unique built-in shelf on the dashboard that serves as a resting place for phones or other personal items, though it can be hard to get your hand in there. A vast amount of space is found under the sliding armrest cover \u2014 it's big enough to store a laptop or a sizable purse. The Highlander offers an average amount of cargo capacity for the segment regardless of how many rows are in place \u2014 nothing significantly outdoes it. Others are better behind the third row, however, specifically the Ford Explorer. A properly equipped Highlander Hybrid Limited can tow up to 3,500 pounds, compared to 5,000 pounds for the conventional gasoline Highlander and most competitors. Toyota's touchscreen infotainment interfaces aren't the flashiest or feature-packed, but they are easy to use. The Highlander's upgrade 8-inch screen is notably quick to respond to inputs and features large, easily pressed icons. Every Highlander comes standard with forward collision warning and automatic braking (includes pedestrian detection), adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and steering assist. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are optional. Frankly,  you should only buy the 2017 Toyota Highlander Hybrid instead of its  conventionally powered sibling because of environmental concerns. It's  extremely unlikely that you'll be able to pay back the Hybrid's price premium  through gas savings alone. Having said that, the XLE trim level is likely where you'll want to start, as we think  most people will appreciate its extra helping of equipment, including a power  liftgate, power front seats, and its leather seating and steering wheel.  Every Highlander Hybrid comes standard with a  3.5-liter V6 engine paired with three electric motors. Total system output is  306 horsepower, and all-wheel drive is standard. Starting things off is the LE, which has 18-inch wheels, a windshield wiper de-icer, forward  collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure  intervention, adaptive cruise control, keyless entry and ignition, a rearview  camera, tri-zone automatic climate control, a height-adjustable driver seat,  Bluetooth, a 6.1-inch touchscreen and a six-speaker sound system.  Our favorite is the XLE. You get the LE's equipment plus a sunroof, a height-adjustable power liftgate, a flip-up rear  window, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems, heated  power front seats, leather upholstery. second-row sunshades, upgraded interior  materials, an 8.1-inch touchscreen, satellite and HD radio, and a navigation  system.  If you want more, there's the Limited with 19-inch wheels, LED running lights, rear parking  sensors, ventilated front seats, driver-seat memory functions, second-row  captain's chairs and a 12-speaker JBL sound system. At the top of the range is  the Limited Platinum with a panoramic sunroof, automatic wipers, front parking  sensors, a 360-degree parking camera system and a heated steering wheel. The XLE and Limited can be equipped with a rear  entertainment system.",

    "full_description": "The 2010 Toyota Prius has been fully redesigned. Key improvements for this third-generation model include more power, better fuel economy, enhanced steering feel, more conventional interior controls and sleeker styling. The Toyota Prius remains the most fuel-efficient and space-efficient hybrid on the market. A few flaws remain, but the changes made for 2010 generally make for a better Prius. The last Toyota Prius flipped the automotive world on its head, changing the purchasing priorities of American car buyers seemingly overnight. Attracted to its sky-high fuel economy, practical body style and green image, consumers came to the Prius for many new car searches (regardless of their actual motoring needs). What was once an automotive oddity relegated to hemp-wearing greenies, the Prius grew to become the country's 13th-best-selling vehicle in 2008. Now there is the all-new 2010 Toyota Prius. It's poised to keep the hybrid revolution going, but with key changes to make it more appealing to an even wider audience.A quick look at the 2010 Prius will reveal a familiar shape, but it's a little sleeker and a tad (dare we say) sportier than its predecessor. Visually, it looks smaller, but it's an optical illusion that creates a more streamlined appearance. Indeed, the 2010 Prius is less than an inch longer and wider than last year's model. The interior is a different story, as headroom has been reduced by a fraction of an inch. This wouldn't seem to be a big deal, but in our testing we found that taller rear seat occupants had their hair grazing the roof, and that wasn't the case before.Under the hood resides a revised version of Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive. There's a larger and more powerful gasoline engine now, but instead of providing quicker off-the-line acceleration, it allows more effortless highway cruising. A smaller electric motor contributes less torque to the overall powertrain dance, but it improves efficiency. There are other mechanical changes, too, but the end result is a jump in fuel economy, from last year's EPA-estimated 48 mpg city/45 mpg highway to this year's 51/48 mpg.Toyota has also addressed other previous Prius faults. A more rigid chassis and a revised electric-assist steering system help to improve steering feel and driver confidence -- the old Prius' steering had a disconnected, video-gamelike feel. While the Prius still isn't exactly fun to drive, its straight-line stability is a lot better now, and in general it feels more like a normal car.The latest Prius might even seem like a small, ultra-efficient luxury sedan depending on how you equip it. Luxury-themed items like heated leather seats, a solar-powered sunroof (cools the interior when parked), a navigation system, radar-based adaptive cruise control (matches your speed to the car ahead), a pre-collision system (retracts seatbelts and applies the brakes if a crash is unavoidable) and a lane-departure warning system for inattentive drivers are all available. Also, the automated self-parking system you've seen in Lexus commercials makes its way onto the Prius' options sheet.The Prius has been a huge success, and with such success comes added competition. The all-new Honda Insight looks similar to the Prius, has similar fuel efficiency and costs less, but it's smaller and less sophisticated. The Ford Fusion Hybrid's more traditional body style and more involving driving dynamics should appeal to those who want their hybrid to be a little more like a normal car. The Camry Hybrid is another possibility, as is the limited-availability Altima Hybrid. Regardless, when it comes to an ultra-practical, ultra-efficient automotive choice that, depending on equipment, can be anything from an economy car to a luxury car, the 2010 Toyota Prius cannot be beat. The 2010 Toyota Prius is powered by Toyota's advanced gasoline-electric hybrid powertrain. A 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine combines with a pair of electric motors (one for propulsion, the other an electrical systems generator) through a planetary-type continuously variable transmission (CVT). The result is a total system output of 134 horsepower. In track testing, we clocked the Prius going from zero to 60 mph in 10.1 seconds, which is roughly the same as the old car and a few ticks quicker than the Honda Insight. The most important number, however, is fuel economy. The EPA estimates the 2010 Prius will return 51 mpg city/48 highway and 50 mpg combined. That's the best fuel efficiency of any mass-market vehicle sold with an internal combustion engine. Every 2010 Toyota Prius comes standard with antilock disc brakes (the old car had rear drums), stability and traction control, front side airbags, side curtain airbags and a driver knee airbag. Optional equipment includes a pre-collision warning system and a lane-departure warning system. In brake testing, the Prius stopped from 60 mph in a short 118 feet, with less fade than the previous rear-drum-equipped car. The 2010 Toyota Prius retains its hyper-quiet cabin, made possible by its part-time electric motivation and plenty of sound-deadening materials. The ride is also quite comfortable, and for 2010, the Prius' structure is tauter, resulting in a less flimsy feel when the car is driven over road imperfections. Another pleasant improvement is the electric steering system, which feels more substantial and better connected to the front tires while still being user-friendly in parking lots.In regard to its hybrid powertrain, new driving modes (EV, eco, power and normal) allow the driver to decide how the car's powertrain should be configured for the driving scenario at hand. Eco is decidedly sluggish, but certainly gets the best fuel economy. You'll want to select power for freeway on-ramps or driving in hilly environments. The EV mode locks out the gasoline engine, but only up to 25 mph with at least a half-charged battery pack. The 2010 Prius features straightforward climate and audio controls that jut out toward the driver in a \"floating console\" that provides a storage area underneath. This is an improvement over the convoluted touchscreen controls of the old Prius. Unfortunately, the materials used in the 2010 version are a step down, with harder and cheaper plastics throughout. The corduroy-like texturing on the climate and audio controls seems nice at first, but after only a few days, finger oils cause circular dark spots on most buttons. Another issue is the off-center digital gauge setup that buries the speedometer and fuel meter amidst a sea of less vital information.In terms of versatility, though, the Prius is still a champ. The hatchback body style provides more cargo capacity than a typical midsize sedan, while its backseat provides lots of space (although headroom is a bit less now). The rear also seems to have less legroom than before, but that's because the front seats thankfully have more legroom. As for the front seats, the addition of driver height adjustment is a benefit for both short and tall drivers. Sadly, the latter still have to contend with a steering wheel that's placed too far away -- there's a telescoping column now, but it doesn't come out nearly far enough. The Navigation package available on all but the Prius II includes a voice-activated touchscreen navigation system with real-time traffic, a back-up camera, a four-disc CD changer (replacing the six-slot) and Bluetooth music streaming. The Solar Roof package can be added to the Navigation package and includes a sunroof with a solar-powered ventilation system that cools the car when it's parked. The Advanced Technology package when added to the Navigation package includes adaptive cruise control, pre-collision alert system, a lane departure warning system and automated self parking.",

    "full_description": "The 2008 Toyota 4Runner gets the formerly optional side curtain airbags as standard equipment. A longtime favorite of ours, the 2008 Toyota 4Runner is a traditional midsize SUV that does just about everything well. Consumers who don't plan on much recreational use, however, would be better served by a top crossover. Sport-utility vehicles, if one was to paraphrase George Bush Sr., have become considerably \"kinder and gentler\" in the past 10 years. And that's been a good thing -- crossover models, with their car-based architecture and on-road-biased handling, are much better suited for the way most consumers use their SUVs. But there are still people who like the idea of owning a traditional truck-based SUV, and for them, there's the 2008 Toyota 4Runner.The body-on-frame 4Runner, a mainstay of Toyota's lineup since the mid-1980s, still has the expected rugged good looks and true off-road capability of a stout, no-nonsense sport-utility vehicle. This might seem like a misguided philosophy when you consider that few SUV owners actually go off-road, but Toyota looks at the situation a bit differently. It sees the 4Runner's all-terrain capability as a selling point over its rivals. If you want a \"soft roader,\" there are plenty to choose from -- Toyota's redesigned Highlander is a perfect example. But if you want a midsize SUV that doesn't faint at the first sign of dirt, the Toyota 4Runner is still the real deal.This isn't to say the 4Runner is a feckless choice for urban duty. It drives well, has a powerful V6 or available V8 under the hood, and is reasonably comfortable. But there's no getting away from the fact that it's an older model last redesigned in 2003. Among the old guard of SUVs, the 4Runner still holds its own, though three of its closest competitors, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Nissan Pathfinder and Dodge Durango, have been significantly updated this year. Compared to most modern crossovers, the 2008 Toyota 4Runner is outclassed in terms of interior space, ride quality and fuel efficiency. SUV shoppers not planning on doing much towing or outdoor recreation would be much better off with something like a Highlander, GMC Acadia or Nissan Murano. The Toyota 4Runner is available with rear- or four-wheel drive and one of two engines. The standard 4.0-liter V6 makes 236 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque. The optional 4.7-liter V8 generates 260 hp and 306 lb-ft of torque. All 4Runners get a five-speed automatic transmission. Towing capacity is 7,300 pounds on V8 models, while V6 models top out at 5,000 pounds. Fuel economy estimates for four-wheel-drive 2008 4Runners stand at 16 mpg city and 20 mpg highway for the V6 and 14/17 mpg for the V8. All models come standard with antilock disc brakes with brake assist, stability control and roll-sensing side-curtain airbags for the first and second rows of seating. Front seat side airbags are also standard. In government crash testing, the 2008 Toyota 4Runner earned four out of five stars in the frontal-impact category and a perfect five stars for side impacts. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests, the vehicle earned a top \"Good\" rating for its protection of occupants in frontal-offset and side-impact collisions. Both engines move the 4Runner out quickly. Although the V8 is a must if you plan on doing any serious towing, most buyers will be happy with the less expensive and more fuel-efficient V6. When driven on pavement, the 2008 Toyota 4Runner delivers a smooth, controlled ride, and handling around turns is surprisingly tight and responsive for a traditional body-on-frame sport-ute. Models with the X-REAS system have their dampers diagonally linked. (The front left damper, or shock, is linked to the rear right and the front right is linked to the rear left.) The system helps improve on-road handling and dampens body roll and pitch. Taken off-road, this Toyota SUV is right at home, tackling steep passes with little drama and delivering an almost luxurious ride even on rutted trails. The Toyota 4Runner offers roomy quarters for four to five passengers. The optional third-row seat strikes us as an afterthought, however. It provides minimal legroom even for kids and it doesn't fold flat into the floor. Instead, each half of the 50/50 third-row seat must be stowed in an upright position along the sideboards or removed completely if you want to carry cargo. The overall design of the interior is aesthetically pleasing and functional, with most controls easy to find and use. Our only major ergonomic complaint concerns the climate controls, which look like intuitive dials but work more like joysticks. Maximum cargo capacity is 75 cubic feet, which trails behind most of the 4Runner's midsize competitors. Options include a navigation system, Bluetooth, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, a premium JBL audio system, a third-row seat and a two-tier cargo shelf. The X-REAS shocks are optional for the Limited and come with a height-adjustable rear air suspension.",

    "full_description": "For  commuters who live in a region where the hydrogen fueling infrastructure is  already built out, opting for the 2019 Toyota Mirai may make a lot of sense.  For starters, it's a genuinely futuristic experience since the Mirai is powered  by a hydrogen fuel cell that converts the stuff of stars into electricity and  water. This electricity goes to a small battery that drives the motor while the  water leaves the tailpipe as vapor. \nUnlike  battery electric vehicles that require lengthy charging to keep them going, the  Mirai's hydrogen fuel tanks can be filled in about the same amount of time as a  car's traditional gasoline tank. The process is just as easy, too \u2014  simply swipe your payment card. Toyota gives you three years' or $15,000 worth  of fuel, so hook up the nozzle and let the hydrogen flow.\nBeyond  the futuristic powertrain, the Mirai drives a lot like any other sedan.  Although there are some clicks and buzzes from the fuel cell, the Mirai is  otherwise ultra-quiet, just like a battery electric vehicle. Performance-wise,  it's not fast, but it is adequate for the day-to-day grind. \nThere  aren't many hydrogen-fueled alternatives, so the Mirai is certainly one to  check out along with the Honda Clarity and the new Hyundai Nexo. Pure battery-electric  vehicles aren't nearly as futuristic, but the infrastructure for recharging is  much further along than that for hydrogen. Our favorites include the Chevrolet  Bolt EV, the Hyundai Kona EV and the Tesla Model 3. No matter what you choose,  know that you're driving the wave of the future.\nWhat's it like to live with?\nTo  learn more about the Toyota Mirai of this generation, read about our  experiences from six months of living with a 2016 Toyota Mirai. We cover everything from seat  comfort to real-world fuel economy, especially important given the Mirai's  hydrogen fuel cell powertrain. Is a fuel cell vehicle worth the expense and  inconvenience? Read through our Toyota Mirai long-term  test to see what we think. There is a nice pickup off the line due to the electric drivetrain's immediate torque delivery. But it never quite feels quick, as demonstrated by its 8.8-second run from 0 to 60 mph. Chalk it up to a hefty curb weight of 4,097 pounds. We measured a 130-foot panic stop from 60 mph due to the skinny, low-drag tires and the aforementioned weight. The result is typical for an EV. The brake pedal feel is quite intuitive in typical driving \u2014 until someone cuts you off and you must act fast, at which point the response gets jumpy. The steering weight feels about right, neither too light nor too heavy. The Mirai generally goes where it's pointed without delay, but it lacks the feedback that lets a driver know exactly how much to turn the wheel to carve the intended path. The Mirai feels coordinated and balanced in daily use, and it is easy to maneuver in tight places. But it begins to feel like a heavy and somewhat narrow car on not-very-grippy tires if you quicken the pace. It's better to not be in a big hurry. Direct-drive electric propulsion means acceleration is seamless with zero shifting. It just goes and goes. It isn't terribly quick, you understand, but it's very smooth. The handsome front seats are nicely sculpted and offer eight-way power adjustments, but the backrest could stand to have more give. The comfy rear seats are individual buckets with a console armrest in between. All four seats have two-stage seat heaters. The Mirai provides a smooth but not plush ride. Drive over some rough pavement, and you'll notice busy body motion now and again. It's generally pleasing, but it could stand a little more polish. The electric motor is very quiet, but the fuel cell and regenerative braking systems do generate occasional odd clicks and keening noises. Tire and wind noise is present in small amounts that will pass unnoticed by most. The touchscreen navigation-audio system is easy to use because of volume and tune knobs, and it responds quickly to touch commands. But its touch-sensitive climate temperature sliders and Prius-like central gauges are questionable. The wide-opening doors are inviting, and it isn't necessary to duck low to climb in up front. The story is much the same for the backseat passengers, but the roof does slope down a little more back there. You'll find ample head- and legroom in the front seats, but the cabin tends to feel a bit narrow at the hip and elbow. Rear legroom is reasonable, but headroom starts to feel tight for those taller than 6 feet, and there are only two rear seats. The slender roof pillars, low door glass and rear three-quarter windows make for good forward and side visibility. A high cowl makes it hard to see the front of the car, but at least front and rear parking sensors and a rearview camera are standard. It's nicely put together, but the interior materials and general fit and finish look like the $32,000 car it would be if it had a gasoline engine, not the $60,000 one it is because of the fuel cell hybrid electric drivetrain. There is no front center console storage, so you'll need to use the modestly sized glovebox and small front door pockets to store your stuff. There is a rear console box, though. The trunk is moderately sized, but the rear seats do not fold down, and there is no pass-through. What you see is all you get. The Mirai comes with driver assist features, a JBL audio system, navigation, and Toyota's own Entune system. This system is Toyota's clunky version of smartphone integration. There's no need to fret over which version of the 2019 Toyota Mirai is right for you since it's only available in one specification. All you need to do is pick your color. \nIt  comes pretty well-equipped, with keyless ignition and entry, blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, parking  sensors, a navigation system, premium audio, a heated steering wheel, and  eight-way power-adjustable and heated seats. It's plenty comfortable.\nThe  fuel cell electric powertrain develops 151 horsepower and 247 pound-feet of  torque. The EPA gives the Mirai a 66 miles per kilogram of hydrogen (mpkg)  estimate. The Honda Clarity Fuel Cell rates 67 mpkg. Read more about the  Mirai's real-world fuel efficiency in our Mirai long-term test.\n ",

The 2018 Toyota  Corolla builds upon the success of its ancestors with expressive styling, a  surprisingly roomy cabin, plenty of advanced safety features and comfortable,  supportive seats. But while the Corolla covers the basics well enough, a few  deficiencies make its rivals better picks overall.  The Corolla's cabin is fairly plain and  does little to make you think you've bought anything more than a basic small  car.

The 2018 Toyota Corolla is certainly popular, and you'll no doubt enjoy its comfortable ride and standard safety features. But interior materials quality is low, and its uninspiring powertrain makes it a snooze to drive. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the 2017 Toyota Corolla SE (1.8-liter inline-4 | CVT automatic | FWD). NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Toyota Corolla has received some  revisions, including the deletion of the SE 50th Anniversary Special Edition  (which will not affect this rating, as the trim was little more than an  appearance package for the XSE). Our findings remain broadly applicable to this  year's Toyota Corolla. The aging four-cylinder engine delivers underwhelming acceleration and whines unpleasantly when asked to work. This characteristic is exacerbated by the CVT automatic, which tries to simulate transmission gear changes without success. We needed 10.1 seconds to reach 60 mph, which is quite slow for the class. Around town, the brakes have a good feel, are smooth and easy to modulate, and don't have the pedal squish that plagues some of the other Toyota models. In our emergency braking tests, the Corolla needed 125 feet to stop, which is slightly longer than average for this segment. At low speeds, steering effort is light, but there's no feel of being connected to the road. It's better in Sport mode at higher speeds; there's less assist, better on-center feel and even some semblance of feedback rounding a corner. Most buyers in this segment will find this adequate. Without any real sporting intentions, the Corolla exhibits surprisingly tidy handling. There isn't much grip supplied by the all-season tires, but we were surprised by how composed the Corolla remains at a mildly spirited pace, which is more than enough to make it feel lively around town. The powertrain delivers decent throttle response despite its lack of  power and unrefined character. The CVT automatic is a little more fickle in how  it adjusts ratios on the fly but also simulates gearshifts in certain  instances. Putting aside all the aural idiosyncrasies, the Corolla is a decent  driver. The SE trim includes sport seats with generous lateral support, and despite its sparse adjustments, the seats proved comfortable over a three-hour trip. Cloth center sections provide breathability, preventing the seats from getting swampy over a longer drive stint. Ride comfort is no better than average for a compact car. It isn't overly floppy and bouncy but it transmits bumps like the small car it is. Higher frequency vibrations are especially prominent and it doesn't seem like much effort was put into making it ride like a larger car. There's an average amount of road noise, a little more than some and less than others in this class. There's also some wind noise around the mirrors, but it's not enough to be a nuisance. The biggest noise offender is the racket created by the engine at full throttle. The climate controls are straightforward with a set of three rocker switches in the center for temperature, fan speed and vent control. The auto climate setting works effectively to maintain comfortable cabin temperature. The Toyota Corolla's cabin layout is clear and familiar and doesn't try to be fancy, so it's pretty easy to use and figure out. The touchscreen is responsive, but it's easy to inadvertently brush a finger against a control you don't mean to, which can be frustrating. Ingress and egress are easy thanks to a low step-over height and wide door openings. Even the rear doors have a good head clearance, which helps minimize the amount of ducking needed to slip into the back seats. There are few seat adjustments beyond the basics. The steering wheel tilts and telescopes, but the puny amount it extends is laughable. Taller drivers will likely have to compromise legroom to accommodate their reach. At least the steering wheel is leather-wrapped and has a nice ergonomic feel. There's an abundance of room up front, though the sport seats may feel a little narrow for larger drivers. There's decent headroom in back and 41.4 inches of legroom, which obliterates everything in the compact segment and embarasses many midsize cars. A nearly flat floor pan also aids foot space. The front windows feel large, and pillars that are thin in your line of sight make for good forward visibility. Rear visibility is also decent thanks to fairly sizable rear windows and headrests that aren't obstructive. A rearview camera is standard. The Corolla lacks in quality feel especially when compared to Honda, Mazda and Subaru. Hard plastic abounds in most areas, which unfortunately cheapens an otherwise attractive interior design. The seats, infotainment, climate controls and steering wheel look of quality; everything else does not. Storage options for small items is average. There's a small tray ahead of the shifter and a relatively small dual-level armrest bin. The door pockets will hold a standard water bottle, but not much else. The glovebox is an average size, and there's no flip-down storage for sunglasses. The Corolla's trunk has a fairly wide opening and a broad floor ahead of the rear wheelwells but, at 13 cubic feet of volume, space is on the lower side of average. The rear seats are split 60/40 and they fold, but there's a pretty significant two-level step up from the trunk floor. Two pairs of LATCH anchors are tucked away somewhat deep into the rear-seat cushions, which doesn't make for easy access. But the upper tethers are located under flip covers and are easier to access. The Corolla's generous rear legroom is advantageous when it comes to rear-facing seats. The audio system is fine, but sound quality begins to get a little fuzzy when you crank up the volume. Navigation comes courtesy of your smartphone after downloading Toyota's Entune app. The screen resolution is sharp, but the glassy piano black surfaces surrounding it are a magnet for fingerprints. There's a USB connector, and Bluetooth pairs quickly and works well. Toyota provides smartphone integration through its own app called Entune, which isn't nearly as robust as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Lane departure/lane keeping assist doesn't operate below 32 mph, though it does a decent job when it's operational. The adaptive cruise control had some trouble maintaining uphill speed and, like Mazda's system, won't bring the car to a stop. Bummer. But this stuff is standard! That's rare. The voice controls respond well to commands, though if they don't there is an option to train the system to recognize your voice. Functions are limited to audio and phone calls unless you use Toyota's Entune app. Siri Voice will work with a paired iPhone if you hold the button longer. If  you don't want to spend too much money, the LE Eco is the way to go. We like it  because you get plenty of features, a slightly more powerful engine, and modest  fuel economy gains over the L and LE. Our top pick, however, is the Corolla SE. It adds a modicum of fun to the  Corolla's otherwise snooze-inducing driving experience. It's also the only model  available with a manual transmission. Select the manual over the drony CVT  automatic and you'll also get extra goodies such as a sunroof and upgraded  infotainment system.  Standard  equipment on the base L model  includes 15-inch steel wheels, LED headlights, LED daytime running lights,  adaptive cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a driver  information display, a height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split folding  rear seat, Bluetooth, a 6.1-inch  touchscreen and a six-speaker audio system with a CD player, a USB port and,  for iPhone users, the Siri Eyes Free voice control system. Standard safety  systems include a rearview camera, forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with  steering assist (to nudge you back into your lane) and automatic high beams. The LE adds 16-inch steel wheels, heated  mirrors, variable intermittent wipers, remote locking and unlocking, metallic  cabin accents, upgraded upholstery, a rear armrest and automatic climate  control. The LE Eco starts with the LE's features  and adds engine and suspension tuning designed for maximum fuel efficiency,  15-inch steel wheels, a rear spoiler and enhanced aerodynamics. The XLE builds upon the LE's set of  features, adding 16-inch alloy wheels, upgraded headlights, LED taillights,  bumper-mounted LED daytime running lights, a sunroof, keyless entry and  ignition, simulated leather upholstery (Toyota's SofTex), a power-adjustable  driver seat (with two-way power lumbar), heated front seats, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, an upgraded driver information display, a 7-inch touchscreen  display, an app-based navigation system (Scout GPS Link), and satellite and HD  radio. The SE is the sporty Corolla, although  we use that term loosely. It starts with the LE's features and adds 17-inch  alloy wheels, unique front-end styling with a black mesh grille, a rear  spoiler, steering wheel with paddle shifters (for CVT automatic models), sport  front seats, SofTex upholstery with cloth inserts, and a sport-style gauge  cluster. Also included are the XLE's upgraded headlights, bumper-mounted LED  daytime running lights and leather-wrapped steering wheel. Opt for the manual  transmission and you'll also get a sunroof, keyless ignition and entry, and the  upgraded infotainment system.  The XSE has the SE manual transmission's  extra features and adds heated front seats, the eight-way power-adjustable  driver seat, the paddle shifters and full SofTex upholstery. A  few options packages are also available. LE and LE Eco models can select the  Premium package, which adds 16-inch alloy wheels, bumper-integrated LED running  lights and the upgraded infotainment system. A sunroof can be added to this  package for the LE (it's included with the package for the LE Eco). The  Premium package for SE CVT automatic models includes keyless entry and ignition,  a sunroof and the upgraded infotainment system, while XLE and XSE models can  opt for an integrated navigation system and smartphone integration via the  Entune App Suite.",

    "full_description": "Toyota has some excellent laurels on which to rest: a history of  outstanding reliability and affordability are nothing to sneeze at, as are many  of its past and current vehicles of high status. But that doesn't change the  fact that it feels like Toyota is resting on its laurels with the 2019 Corolla.  The Corolla does a few things well -- offering ample passenger space,  comfortable seats, and a suite of standard accident avoidance tech -- but  beyond that, the Corolla is a conveyance, and little more. That's  a problem when the rest of the compact car class has been making such strides  in quality, drivability, and technology. Compared to its rivals, the Corolla is  slow and dreary to drive, with fuel economy that lags behind class leaders. The  interior feels a bit hollow and low buck, and it lacks the easy smartphone  integration that's become available in most other compact cars. A  smaller-than-average trunk is another issue. Overall, there's not much about the  2019 Toyota Corolla that impresses.  The 2019 Toyota Corolla is popular, but quantity does not necessarily equal the best quality available. Though packed with standard features, the Corolla is let down by an outdated powertrain and lackluster interior materials. This car is due for a genuine overhaul.

    "full_description": "Front-seat side airbags and two-row side curtain airbags are standard on the 2007 Toyota Highlander. Toyota's midsize crossover SUV also gets revised headlights this year. With its fuel-efficient engine lineup, full complement of safety features and easygoing demeanor, the midsize Highlander has always been a solid choice for those who need SUV utility without unnecessary bulk. However, with several new crossovers entering the market this year, it's a good idea to explore your options before making a decision. Representing the seventh year of the model cycle, the 2007 Toyota Highlander is the oldest midsize crossover SUV on the market. Like most Toyotas, though, it was well designed from the start and has aged gracefully over the years. Key strengths include a comfortable ride, easy maneuverability in tight spaces, above-average gas mileage and a high-quality interior with ample room in the first and second rows. Toyota added a third-row seat in 2004 to keep up with newer rivals, but it's more of an afterthought than it is functional and buyers who need seven-passenger capacity will be better served by one of the Highlander's competitors. For families of four, though, the Toyota Highlander remains an acceptable choice, especially considering its many standard safety features and strong crash-test ratings.Based on the 1997-2001 Camry platform, the Highlander immediately won over consumers with its refined driving dynamics. At a time when most SUVs in this price range were still built on truck platforms and were unwieldy to drive, Toyota gave buyers the equivalent of a tall station wagon with optional all-wheel drive and a choice of a frugal four-cylinder or a smooth V6 engine. Make no mistake: The Toyota Highlander has never been a particularly stylish or sporty vehicle. Rather, it's a highly practical and economical vehicle for buyers whose lives are consumed by children, commutes and grocery store runs.The problem is that the Highlander's useful packaging has been copied many times over, and many peers are now doing it better. Perhaps the stiffest competition comes from Toyota's own RAV4, which is now almost as big as the Highlander and offers just as much headroom and legroom. In addition, the less expensive RAV handles better and can be equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 that's more powerful and fuel-efficient than the Highlander's 3.3-liter V6. Other competitors you'll want to consider include the Ford Edge; Honda Pilot; Hyundai Santa Fe; Mazda CX-7 and CX-9; Mitsubishi Outlander and Endeavor; Nissan Murano and the Buick Enclave/GMC Acadia/Saturn Outlook triplets. All of these vehicles have their merits, but the well-rounded Pilot, Santa Fe and CX-9 are our top choices in this group. If you still want to purchase a 2007 Toyota Highlander, we won't stand in your way, but we would encourage you to test-drive a few other crossover SUVs before doing so. There are two engine choices on the 2007 Toyota Highlander. Base models come standard with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder rated for 155 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque. Optional on base Highlanders and standard on the Sport and Limited is a 3.3-liter V6 good for 215 hp and 222 lb-ft of torque. A four-speed automatic transmission is standard on four-cylinder models, while V6 Highlanders upgrade to a five-speed automatic. Buyers can get front-wheel drive (2WD) or all-wheel drive (AWD) with either engine. Fuel economy ratings range from 22 mpg city/28 mpg highway on 2WD four-cylinder models to 18/24 on AWD V6 Highlanders. Tow ratings are on the light side, the maximum being 3,500 pounds on a properly equipped V6 model. All 2007 Toyota Highlanders come with antilock disc brakes (with brake assist), stability control, front-seat side airbags and side curtain airbags for the first and second rows. A tire-pressure warning system and whiplash-reducing front head restraints are also included. In NHTSA crash testing, the Highlander scored five stars (out of a possible five) for frontal-impact protection. In side-impact tests, it again received five stars for both front and rear passengers. In frontal-offset crash testing administered by the IIHS, the Toyota earned a \"Good\" rating (the best possible). A fully independent suspension delivers a solid combination of comfort and control, although even in Sport trim, the Highlander favors ride quality over handling. One advantage the Highlander has over many of the newer midsize crossover SUVs is a lower curb weight, which gives it a more nimble feel than some of them. The base four-cylinder engine provides adequate power for those who travel light, but most 2007 Toyota Highlander buyers will prefer the V6, which provides smooth, capable acceleration in all situations. The Highlander's passenger accommodations are reasonably spacious, but newer competitors offer more room in the second row. Ordering the third-row bench allows the Toyota to seat two additional passengers, preferably small ones, for a total capacity of seven. Unfortunately, the second-row seat's lack of a flip-and-fold mechanism makes for poor access to the third row and limits the seven-passenger Highlander's appeal for carpooling. When it's time to haul groceries, the third-row seat folds flat into the floor (without requiring removal of the headrests), opening up 39.7 cubic feet of cargo space. Drop the 60/40-split second-row seats and there are 80.6 cubes to go around. Popular options for the Highlander include leather upholstery, a sunroof, an in-dash CD changer, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, a tow package and, on the Limited only, a navigation system. The third-row seat is optional on base and Sport models.",

    "full_description": "The 2018 Toyota RAV4 represents the  current generation's sixth and likely final year since it was completely  redesigned. It's received a nip here, a tuck there, and a few extra safety  features over the years, but it's largely the same utility-focused vehicle it  always has been. And really, it's those standard safety features and its  enormous interior that help keep it relevant despite virtually all of its  competitors being redesigned.  Take a test drive of the RAV4 and some  other top crossovers and you'll likely notice that the RAV4 looks and feels a  bit behind the times. Its utility-focused interior lacks the refinement,  quality and style of key rivals that can feel borderline luxurious. You can't  even get the RAV4 with real leather upholstery. The RAV4 is also less engaging  to drive, with subpar handling and an engine that trails in terms of both  acceleration and fuel economy. Tech features can also be lacking \u2014  yes, safety tech is standard, but Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and onboard Wi-Fi  are not available. To be fair, these issues are most obvious  on the RAV4's upper trim levels. Less expensive RAV4s such as the XLE are  better able to showcase their space advantages and standard safety equipment.  If you're shopping in that price range, the 2018 RAV4 is certainly worth a look,  but we also suggest checking out higher-rated crossovers such as the Chevrolet  Equinox, Honda CR-V and Mazda CX-5. The 2018 Toyota RAV4's roomy interior, numerous standard safety features and reputation for reliability make it a reasonable choice for a small crossover. But many rivals are more refined, engaging and even luxurious. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the 2017 Toyota RAV4 SE (2.5L  inline-4 | 6-speed automatic | FWD). NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, Toyota raised the SE's suspension, which could  alter the SE's handling, ride and off-road ratings. Our findings remain broadly  applicable, however.  The RAV4 feels surprisingly punchy around town, and the gas pedal is responsive to your inputs. However, the engine runs out of steam pretty quickly. In Edmunds testing, our test RAV4 needed 9 seconds to accelerate from zero to 60 mph, making it one of the slower vehicles in this class. The brake pedal's action is long and mushy, with very little resistance. You have to press the pedal firmly to bring the RAV4 to a stop. It took 121 feet to halt from 60 mph in our testing, which is an average distance in the compact crossover class. Steering effort is a little heavier than normal for this class. The wheel isn't difficult to turn, however, and it's easy to maneuver into a parking spot. Out on the road, rivals from Ford, Honda and Mazda provide more engaging and confidence-inspiring steering. The RAV4 seems stable around turns, feeling well balanced and predictable. It's easy to drive. But the RAV4 lacks that extra zest offered by competitors that engages the driver. It's a bit of a snooze. The RAV4 feels just right in its default driving mode. We're not fans of the Eco mode's overly delayed gas-pedal response and eager-to-upshift transmission programming. Even in Sport mode, the transmission doesn't always respond to commands while manually shifting and displays the incorrect gear. A lockable center differential with all-wheel drive, and even the front-wheel drive's limited-slip differential, make the RAV4 a bit more capable than most rivals. However, this is still a light-duty off-roader and its ground clearance (even in the raised SE and Adventure) is nothing special. Front seats are comfy enough, but there's no lumbar adjustment unless you upgrade to the SE (though its imitation leather isn't as comfy as the XLE's cloth). Only the driver seat is height-adjustable. Three-person seating in the back is challenging due to an oddly placed middle seat-belt anchor. The SE's sporty suspension tuning improves handling but not enough to warrant the busier and harsher ride. Perhaps the extra suspension travel for 2018 will change this, but we'd probably stick with any of the other, more comfortable-riding trim levels. There's not much engine noise at any speed unless you're really pushing the car hard. Levels of wind and tire noise, especially tire smack, are overly intrusive while cruising on the highway. Nowhere as serene as Mazda and Honda rivals. The dual-zone climate control adeptly cools the interior on a hot day. There are no rear air vents. Toggle switches for the heated seats are hidden depending on viewing angle, so you'll have to remember to switch them off. Even on the low setting, they get nice and toasty. The infotainment system features a nice mix between physical buttons and easy-to-press virtual ones. Eco and Sport buttons are out of the way, as are toggle switches for the heated front seats. A low step-in height and tall doors make for easy entry and exit in the front. Steering wheel tilt is limited, and drivers might hit their knees on the column. Entering and exiting the rear are also easy thanks to the seats' lack of contouring. The driver's seat offers enough range of height adjustment, and the seat bottom angles up nicely. As in many other Toyotas, the steering wheel doesn't offer enough tilt or telescoping adjustment. There's an abundance of head- and legroom throughout the cabin. Four 6-footers will have no problem on a long road trip. Even the middle seat position has enough headroom for an adult. The side bolsters make the front seats a bit narrow. The tall and wide windows allow for an expansive view out. There's a sizable window in the three-quarter view that compensates for the wide rear roof pillar. The rear window is also large. Overall, the RAV4 is impressively easy to see out of. The RAV4 looks and feels cheap compared to its top competitors. There's a ton of hard plastic throughout and the utilitarian design doesn't help. SofTex vinyl covers the seats in top four trims, but unlike other faux leathers, it's obviously vinyl. There's no option for real leather. Two cupholders of different sizes are separated by the shifter. Strange. There are a couple of small, oddly shaped storage areas on the center stack, including a shallow, low-grip smartphone holder that isn't very good at holding smartphones. Not great for this family-friendly segment. The cargo area is wide and flat, with a very low liftover height. Its volume of 38.4 cubic feet with the rear seats in place and 73.4 cubes with them folded is about as good as it gets in this segment. Excellent for bulky items, big dogs. The rear seats are split 60/40 with no center pass-through. The lower LATCH anchors are well-concealed and far from the seatback; you really have to reach in and fish around to find them. The three seatback tethers can be accessed with the cargo cover in place, but these are also hidden under a thin cloth cover. Towing capability depends on the trim and drivetrain. Most variants can manage only a meager 1,500 pounds, but the Adventure boasts 2,900 pounds with front-wheel drive and 3,500 pounds with all-wheel drive. That's pretty strong for this segment. The standard touchscreen is easy to use. It has a relatively simple layout and menu structure, but it's not particularly attractive, the screen is small and resolution is fairly low. The optional 7-inch screen offers nominal improvement. Either washes out in direct sunlight. There's a single USB port in front and none in the back. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are notably absent. Instead, Toyota uses a smartphone integration system of its own design called Entune. You'll have to download the app, create an account, and pair your phone before it's ready to be used. Unique for the segment, the RAV4 comes standard with forward collision warning, automatic braking, lane keeping assist and adaptive cruise control. Blind-spot warning is available on all but the LE. Adaptive cruise doesn't maintain speed downhill, and clarity of the standard rearview camera is poor. Hitting the voice control button displays a list of phrases, and the recognition software also recognizes natural speech. It's not the best, with a lot of garbled translations before it hits the mark. Best to use Siri Eyes Free if you have an iPhone (accessed by holding the phone disconnect button). We  would opt for the RAV4's new Adventure trim. Its extra ground clearance and sharper styling are appreciated over the  XLE, while its pricing and feature content still land in a sweet spot. Upper  trim levels just aren't luxurious enough to warrant their extra price relative  to the RAV4's ritzier competitors. We would, however, upgrade the Adventure  with the Cold Weather package that adds the greatly desired power driver seat,  heated front seats and leather-wrapped steering wheel. Its fabric upholstery is  also preferable to the upper trims' unconvincing SofTex simulated leather. The RAV4 LE comes standard with 17-inch steel wheels, rear privacy glass,  Toyota Safety Sense P (forward collision warning and automatic emergency  braking, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic high  beams), a rearview camera, a height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split  folding and reclining second-row seat, a 6.1-inch touchscreen interface, one  USB port, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player and an  auxiliary audio jack. The XLE adds 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, heated mirrors, upgraded interior trim, a  sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel,  more aggressively bolstered front seats and extending sun visors. Heated front  seats with a power-adjustable driver adjustment are optional. The Adventure adds special styling flourishes, 18-inch black alloy wheels, a slightly raised  suspension (6.5 inches of ground clearance versus 6.1), fender flares,  all-weather floor mats, a leather-wrapped shift knob and a 120-volt  household-style outlet in the cargo area. The Cold Weather package, exclusive  to the Adventure, adds heated front seats, the power driver seat, a heated  steering wheel, and a windshield wiper de-icer. The SE gets some of the same styling flourishes as the Adventure and the same ground  clearance hike, but from there, they differ. The SE adds automatic LED  headlights, LED daytime running lights, LED taillights, 18-inch silver alloy  wheels, sportier suspension tuning, an upgraded rearview camera, steering-wheel  shift paddles, the power driver seat (plus power lumbar adjustment), heated  front seats and SofTex simulated leather upholstery. On the SE, you also get the Entune Audio  Plus with Connected Navigation package that adds satellite radio, HD radio and  a Scout GPS navigation app that works through your smartphone connection. It's  optional on LE, XLE and Adventure.The Limited reverts to the XLE's ground clearance, suspension tuning and styling, but keeps  its equipment upgrades. It also adds different 18-inch wheels, chrome exterior  trim, a height-adjustable power liftgate, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic  warning systems, keyless ignition and entry, driver-seat memory functions, an  auto-dimming mirror, and the Entune Premium Audio with Integrated Navigation  and App Suite package (optional on XLE and Adventure) that adds a 7-inch  higher-resolution touchscreen and a Toyota navigation system. Most of the Limited's other functional  upgrades can be added to the XLE, Adventure and SE trim levels through a  variety of \"extra value\" packages.At the top of the RAV4 lineup is the Platinum. It includes front and rear parking sensors, a hands-free liftgate,  fancier exterior trim, a 360-degree parking camera, a heated steering wheel,  and the Entune Premium JBL Audio with Integrated Navigation and App Suite  package (optional on SE and Limited) that adds an 11-speaker JBL sound system  to all the other items featured in the Entune packages. All of the Platinum's  extra functional upgrades can be added to the SE and Limited through an  Advanced Technology package.",

    "full_description": "Somewhere on the automotive timeline,  owning a minivan changed from smart and sensible family transportation to an  admission of suburban defeat, a shift in attitude that in part explains the  popularity of crossover SUVs. That's a shame really since a minivan like the  2019 Toyota Sienna offers features such as sliding side doors, easy entry and  exit, and massive interior space that just make life easier for active  families.  \nThe Sienna's stout V6 gives it the power  of a comparable SUV, and its eight-speed transmission helps maximize fuel  economy. The Sienna has long held an edge on its rivals by offering optional  all-wheel drive, and for 2019 that option expands to its sporty SE trim level  as well. \nThe Sienna can seat up to eight  passengers inside, although optional second-row captain's chairs mean more room  for seven passengers to spread out. For 2019, the Sienna also gets a tech upgrade with Amazon  Alexa voice-assistant integration, as well as Apple CarPlay. The latter is a  welcome addition since it gives iPhone owners a way to largely bypass using  Toyota's otherwise mediocre Entune infotainment system.\nThe Sienna remains a solid choice, but  it's one of the oldest minivan designs on the road. Its last redesign was in  2011, while key competitors including the Honda Odyssey, Kia Sedona and  Chrysler Pacifica all boast newer and more modern designs.  Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the Toyota Sienna Limited Premium (3.5L  V6 | 8-speed automatic | FWD). There's enough power for your typical driving situations, and the V6 engine feels quite lively at full throttle. We clocked a 0-60 mph sprint of 7.8 seconds, which is respectably quick for a family hauler. The Sienna slows down smoothly thanks to fairly soft pedal action and linear braking force. It's perfect for the sort of stop-and-go driving you do around town. We recorded an emergency-stopping distance from 60 mph in 132 feet, which is an acceptable result for the class. Some road feedback transmits through the steering wheel, but otherwise the wheel is lifeless. Effort is light and lacks natural buildup. There's also no increased effort at higher speeds, which would aid stability. The Sienna exhibits noticeable body roll when you hustle it through turns. You'll need to slow down to keep your passengers happy. The Sienna SE, with its sport-tuned suspension, is more stable along twisty roads. When cold, the eight-speed transmission in our test vehicle revved the engine higher than expected when accelerating from a stop. This tendency subsided largely after the engine and transmission had warmed up. Also, we noticed the transmission was sometimes reluctant to downshift on uphill grades. Otherwise, the Sienna is easy to drive. The cushy seats are covered with soft, compliant leather. Some of our drivers had trouble remaining comfortable on longer trips, and found themselves making adjustments along the way. The extendable second-row leg rests are a nice touch. The Sienna glides down the highway, offering a supremely comfortable ride. It can get a little unsettled if you hit a bump in the middle of a turn, but that's the only real knock against it. There's a great deal of wind and road noise, especially at highway speeds. Aside from full throttle, you don't hear the V6 much. The climate control system's gale-force winds produce an extraordinary din. We also experienced some trim rattles in this test vehicle that weren't present in previous Siennas we tested. Tri-zone climate control is standard across all trims, with vents above the rear outboard passengers. The heated steering wheel delivers effective heat, and the heated front seats get quite toasty on the highest setting. The perforated upholstery breathes adequately, but ventilation would be ideal. Many controls are awkwardly located, especially those for the rear entertainment system. The seat heater switches are hard for the passenger to reach with the dash-mounted cupholders deployed. The voice projection feature, which amplifies the driver's voice, is buried in touchscreen menus. Entry and exit through any door is a cinch. We caution those who use the armrests to hoist themselves out of the rear seats that these armrests are a bit flimsy. Exiting the third row is fairly simple \u2014 use the strap or grab handle on the bottom of a second-row seat to slide it forward. The seats are really heavy, though. The driver's seat offers a wide range of vertical adjustment to accommodate a variety of body types. The front of the seat bottom tilts up high enough to provide thigh support for taller drivers. The steering wheel doesn't tilt or telescope much, so you might not be able to reach an ideal position. There's an ample amount of room up front, and the second-row seats slide all the way to the third row, though a sloping roofline reduces headroom the farther you go back. There's enough legroom in the third row to accommodate adults, though taller individuals might find headroom a bit limited. The massive windshield and large windows provide an expansive view outward. The rear pillars aren't overly bulky, so you still have a wide view of the area directly behind you. The beltline rises a bit by the third-row windows but doesn't compromise the three-quarter rear view. The interior of our top-trim test Sienna feels comparable to a Chrysler Pacifica or Kia Sedona and about a half-step behind the Honda Odyssey. We didn't detect any creaks or rattles on the van we tested, but the same can't be said for every version of this generation we've tested. Twelve cupholders are placed throughout the Sienna. Most notable are the two pop-out holders on the dash and two behind the center console that can slide and extend back to reach second-row occupants. The center bin in front is deep, and the third row has two decent-size bins. The load floor is almost flat with the third row folded. A low cargo liftover height helps during loading of items. The Sienna boasts excellent cargo volume. Controls for the power-folding seats are located on a panel just below the top of the hatch, a less-than-ideal location. The second-row seats slide fore and aft without having to remove installed child seats, which is great. The seats are very heavy to slide, which is not great. The LATCH anchors are well-placed, but the leather surrounding them is rigid and requires manipulation to push aside. Tethers are hidden at the base of the seatbacks. The infotainment is simple enough to operate, but the touchscreen resolution is low, the screen washes out in direct sunlight, and the interface isn't particularly attractive. The rear entertainment display is a drop-down widescreen that can display one video across or two with a split-view screen. The 2019 model has better device integration than when this generation debuted in 2017. Up front, you'll find one USB port and an HDMI port. In back are two more USB ports. The good news is Apple CarPlay is now available. Android phone users are still out of luck. Toyota Safety Sense is standard on all Sienna trim levels. Features include pedestrian detection, lane keeping assist, automatic high beams and adaptive cruise control. All aids function just OK, but adaptive cruise shuts off at 25 mph, so you can't use it in stop-and-go traffic. The Entune system asks for commands using a set of predetermined phrases, but it does understand some natural speech. CarPlay is available for connected iPhones. Driver Easy Speak projects the driver's voice through the rear speakers. It's useful for when the kids become unruly. While we don't think you should buy a  minivan for its sporting value (bit of a contradictory impulse), the Sienna SE is our pick. It offers the same  features as the lower LE trim, which include tri-zone climate control,  power-sliding side doors, and a Wi-Fi hotspot, but it adds sportier styling and  handling, leather upholstery, heated front seats and a power liftgate. The SE  is also now available with all-wheel drive. \nAll  Sienna trims come with a 3.5-liter V6 engine (296 horsepower, 263 pound-feet of  torque) paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is  optional on every trim level except the L. Depending on the configuration and  trim, the Sienna seats either seven or eight passengers. \nStandard  features for the base L include  17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, a wiper de-icer, tri-zone automatic  climate control, keyless entry, a rearview camera, a conversation mirror,  Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen with Toyota's Entune interface, Apple CarPlay  smartphone integration, five USB ports, and a six-speaker sound system with a  CD player, media player interface and an auxiliary audio jack.\nToyota Safety Sense also comes standard starting with L trims. It includes  forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency  braking, lane departure warning and lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise  control and automatic headlights.\nThe LE adds roof rails, power-sliding  rear doors, privacy glass, heated mirrors, a power-adjustable driver's seat,  upgraded easy-clean fabric upholstery and rear sunshades. All-wheel-drive  versions also get 18-inch wheels. \nThe SE is equipped similarly to the LE  but adds a sport-tuned suspension, sharper steering, 19-inch alloy wheels  (18-inch for all-wheel-drive models) and sportier exterior styling. The SE also  has a power liftgate, first- and second-row leather upholstery (the third row  gets premium vinyl), heated front seats, and unique gauges with a larger driver  information screen. \nThe SE Premium adds a sunroof, keyless  ignition and entry, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems,  a navigation system, a premium JBL sound system, a rear-seat entertainment  system, and the Driver Easy Speak system, which amplifies the driver's voice  through the rear speakers. \nThe  Sienna XLE shares many of the SE  trim's comfort and convenience equipment, but it features similar suspension,  steering and styling to the LE. It also adds a power-adjustable front passenger  seat, imitation-wood trim, power-opening rear-quarter windows and keyless  ignition and entry. The XLE Premium adds the SE Premium's features and rear parking sensors. \nThe  plush Limited includes the XLE  Premium's features (minus the rear entertainment system), along with 18-inch  alloy wheels, a different grille, LED daytime running lights, auto-dimming and  power-folding mirrors, front and rear sunroofs, and front and rear parking  sensors. Inside is first- and second-row premium leather upholstery,  driver-seat memory settings and a heated steering wheel. \nFront-wheel-drive  models also get a sliding center console between the first two rows, extendable  footrests for the second row, and a power-folding third row with faux leather  upholstery. \nYou  can add even more with the Limited  Premium trim, which tacks on xenon headlights, automatic wipers, a  surround-view parking camera system, the rear-seat entertainment system and  upgraded third-row leather (AWD only).",

    "full_description": "For 2007, Toyota has discontinued the sporty Corolla XRS trim level. For the LE trim, leather seating is no longer available. The 2007 Toyota Corolla is a vice-free economy car with lots of name cachet. Unfortunately, it costs too much and suffers from a bland personality. Toyota's venerable Corolla has gone through many changes since it was first introduced almost 40 years ago. Over the course of its long life, the Toyota Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan. Enough people in the world have chosen this Toyota model to make it the best-selling nameplate in the history of automobiles. As you might therefore expect, the Corolla has earned a significant amount of undeterred loyalty.The 2007 Toyota Corolla, which represents the ninth generation, is an agreeable economy car. On the inside, a user-friendly control layout matches up with materials that seem nice enough to be used in a more expensive Camry. Although room in the front seat is merely average, the backseat is spacious enough to accommodate adults comfortably. On the road, the Corolla is easy to drive, though its 126-horsepower engine provides only mediocre performance.If that latter trait was the Corolla's only problem, we could probably make an endorsement. But instead it's representative of a more holistic problem -- model age. The current Corolla is past due for a redesign, and it's readily apparent when one compares the car to fresher competitors. For instance, the Corolla's arch-nemesis, the Civic, was redesigned just last year, and it offers a more contemporary look, along with coupe and sedan body styles, more power, better features and a wider range of fuel-efficiency-focused and performance-themed models.Alternately, if you're looking for nothing more than basic transportation, the 2007 Toyota Corolla -- particularly a loaded-up version -- is overkill. There are a number of compact sedans that offer equivalent accommodations, features and performance for considerably less money. Do they have equally stellar reputations for quality and reliability? Probably not, but with warranties extending as far as 100,000 miles, it hardly seems much of a risk. Only for Corolla devotees or those willing to spend a little extra for peace of mind will a purchase this year make reasonable sense. Power for Corolla CE, LE and S models comes in the form of a 126-hp 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. A five-speed manual transmission is standard and a four-speed automatic is optional. Fuel economy is better than average for this class of car; EPA figures are 30 mpg city/38 mpg highway with the automatic transmission. For the 2007 Toyota Corolla, antilock brakes, full-length side curtain airbags and front-seat side airbags are optional. A stability control system that also adds traction control and brake assist is optional on S and LE models equipped with an automatic transmission and ABS. In NHTSA crash tests, the Toyota Corolla earned five stars (the best score possible) for frontal-impact protection and four stars for side-impact protection. In 40 mph frontal-offset crash testing by the IIHS, it received a \"Good\" rating (the highest possible). The IIHS gave a worst rating of \"Poor\" to the Corolla for the car's protection in side-impact crashes. That rating rises to \"Acceptable\" if the car is equipped with the optional side and side curtain airbags. From a stop, the Corolla's acceleration is acceptable but nothing more. During highway driving, it's a quiet cruiser, with very little engine noise and even less wind noise. Though not as sporty as some competitors, the 2007 Toyota Corolla offers an appealing compromise between handling and comfort. It rides smoothly enough to be used as a commuter car, while maintaining its composure when occasionally pushed around the corners. The Corolla's interior is furnished with high-quality materials and user-friendly controls that wouldn't seem out of place in a more expensive car. Even with the car's tall cabin design, room in the front seats is only average, with a somewhat awkward seating position for the driver. Meanwhile, two adults can sit comfortably in the backseat without ducked heads or pulled-up legs. Trunk capacity measures a generous 13.6 cubic feet. The 2007 Toyota Corolla economy sedan is available in three trim levels: CE, S and LE. The base CE comes with 15-inch steel wheels, air-conditioning, a CD player, power mirrors, a height-adjustable driver seat, an outside temperature gauge and a 60/40-split folding rear seat. The S is similar but has a lower body styling kit, a rear deck spoiler, foglights and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Go with the Corolla LE to gain fake wood trim, Optitron gauges, power windows and locks, and remote keyless entry. You can get the power windows and locks as options on the CE and S. Other available options, depending on the trim level, include 16-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof, upgraded audio systems and cruise control.",

    "full_description": "The  Toyota Prius is easily the most well-known and influential hybrid sold. Over  the years, the Prius has evolved and steadily gained fuel efficiency and  capability. Toyota introduced the current generation for the 2016 model year  and made a variety of updates for 2019. The 2021 Prius boasts up to an  EPA-estimated 56 mpg in combined city/highway driving, which is excellent for a  hybrid. You can even get it with all-wheel drive to help out with traction on  icy or snowy roads. \nTo  keep the Prius competitive, Toyota also fits the Prius with Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto smartphone integration and a suite of advanced safety features  that's standard on all Prius trims. Some noteworthy competitors on sale today  include the Honda Insight and the Kia Niro. Toyota also offers hybrid variants  of its Camry, Corolla and RAV4. Their fuel economy isn't as high, but their  more conventional styling and/or greater practicality make them viable  alternatives as well.\nWhat's it like to live with?\nTo learn more about the Toyota Prius of this generation,  read about our experiences from living with a 2016  Toyota Prius.  After its debut, we went out and bought one and racked up more than 30,000  miles. We cover everything from this hybrid's real-world fuel economy to seat  comfort and cargo space. Please note that the 2021 Toyota Prius differs from  our long-term 2016 model in that the newer model has updated styling and more  standard features. It's the same generation, though, so most of our  observations still apply. It's  tempting to keep the Prius basic, maximizing both cost and fuel efficiency, but  we'd splurge a little and get the midgrade XLE.  We prefer the XLE's heated simulated-leather seats, the standard wireless phone  charger, and auto-dimming interior mirror as well as the available option  packages should you want a sunroof or head-up display. How does the Prius drive? You're not buying a Prius to get engaging performance. In Edmunds testing, our all-wheel-drive Prius test car covered 0-60 mph in 10.5 seconds, which is among the slowest cars around, hybrid or not. (Perhaps somewhat paradoxically, the lighter, front-drive Prius was marginally slower.) The Prius is also pretty tepid when it comes to agility and handling precision.\n\nWe do like the Prius' easy-driving nature and its smooth transitions from electric motor drive to gasoline engine power. Another Prius advantage is its available all-wheel drive. It should be noted, though, that the rear wheels only intervene when the front wheels lose traction. So in most dry-weather scenarios, you'll never feel them working. How comfortable is the Prius? The front seats are softly padded. Most drivers will find them comfortable for the long haul, though taller drivers or those with long legs might find the seat bottoms to be a few inches too short. The cabin is generally quiet unless you floor the gas pedal, at which point the engine gets rather raucous.\n\n   Another downside is the Prius' ride quality over broken pavement and concrete expansion joints. The impacts from these types of bumps can make the car feel jittery. Since the car is so quiet, these bumps are perhaps more noticeable than they'd otherwise be. How\u2019s the interior? The Prius is a fundamentally easy car to get into and drive. Aside from the shifter, all other controls will feel immediately comfortable to the majority of drivers. Most drivers should also be able to find a comfortable driving position thanks to the seat's wide range of adjustability. \n\n   But we wish there was more telescoping range in the steering wheel, and most of the instrument panel information is not in the driver's line of sight. The 11.6-inch screen on the top-tier Limited model has most of the car's climate control settings and buttons in on-screen submenus. From an ease-of-use standpoint, it seems like a step backward from the dedicated physical buttons on lower Prius trim levels. How\u2019s the tech? As advanced as the Prius is from a powertrain standpoint, it can seem a little odd that it comes up a bit short in in-car tech. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, but the standard infotainment system looks and feels dated. Even the big 11.6-inch screen on the top-tier Limited model seems like a gimmick since Toyota doesn't do much to take advantage of the larger space.\n\n   The Prius, however, comes standard with a full suite of advanced driving aids. Most of them work well, and the adaptive cruise control can bring the Prius to a complete stop. How\u2019s the storage? Thanks to its cavernous hatchback cargo area and fold-down rear seatbacks, the Prius is quite useful for carrying luggage, groceries or whatever else you want to put back there. Up front, there's enough in-cabin storage for the daily odds and ends, and the cupholders securely hold beverages under the circumstances in which most Priuses are typically driven. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Prius is known for its frugal use of gasoline. The EPA estimates a range of up to 56 mpg in combined city/highway driving for the Eco trim level or down to 49 mpg with all-wheel drive. In our own fuel economy testing of a couple of Prius test cars, we've been able to verify that the EPA's estimates are achievable in real-world driving. Is the Prius a good value? The Prius' interior feels well built even if some cabin materials are a little too plasticky. It's still one of the best vehicles for fuel economy, and the AWD version delivers some extra assurance for drivers who live in snow country. \n\n   As for warranties, Toyota gives you its regular coverage, which includes a longer duration (eight years or 100,000 miles) for the hybrid components. You also get Toyota's two free years of scheduled maintenance. The Prius isn't exciting to drive or filled with luxury features. Instead, the Prius is all about being easy-to-drive, practical and comfortable and, of course, saving on gas.",

    "full_description": "For 2015, the Toyota Sienna gets a refresh. It doesn't look much different on the outside (updated grille and taillights), but under the skin there's a revised suspension, a stronger body structure and welcome improvements to the interior's design and materials quality. Roomy, comfortable and offered in several different trim levels, the Toyota Sienna minivan is an excellent choice for families. And the changes for 2015 have made it even better.Notably, we picked the 2015 Toyota Sienna as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars, Trucks and SUVs. You're not likely to buy a minivan to make a fashion  statement. A box on wheels just doesn't lend itself to sleek, Jaguar-esque  proportions, you know? But if you need something to expertly haul your family,  your stuff, or your family and stuff,  you've come to the right place in checking out the updated 2015 Toyota Sienna.\nPreviously, we've lauded the Sienna for its comfortable  seating and both strong performance and respectable fuel economy. That  continues to be the case for 2015. However, we were previously turned off by  the interior's odd dash design and hard, cheap-feeling plastics. For 2015, Toyota has righted those wrongs with a new  more user-friendly dash and nicer interior trim.\n\nUpdated for  2015, the Toyota Sienna is one of top recommended minivans. It comes in many  trim levels, including this SE.\nYou might also notice the 2015 Sienna's subtly updated front  and rear exterior styling, and those improvements don't just end at the  surface. Toyota says it also strengthened the body structure and retuned the  van's suspension to improve ride comfort as well as handling. We've driven this  year's Sienna and can report that it is indeed a more secure-feeling and  comfortable minivan to drive.\nIn previous years, we always recommended the SE version of  the Sienna, as it offers the sharpest and most carlike handling of the Sienna  line. It returns for 2015, but now the SE is available with more equipment,  meaning you no longer have to forgo desirable creature comforts if you choose  the sportiest model in the Sienna family. Meanwhile, the continued availability  of all-wheel drive ( the Sienna is the only minivan that gives you this option  for 2015) is another bonus if you frequently deal with snow or wet road  conditions.\nWith all these points in its favor, the 2015 Toyota Sienna is  one of our top recommended minivans. Our other favorite is the equally impressive 2015  Honda Odyssey, and we definitely recommend cross-shopping both of  these all-stars. You might also want to check out the redesigned 2015  Kia Sedona, the off-beat 2015 Nissan Quest and the value-oriented Dodge Grand Caravan,  especially if you want a van that can be more easily converted to carry lots of  cargo. Overall, though, we think you'll be very happy with Toyota's latest  version of this family-friendly box on wheels. Every Toyota Sienna comes with a 3.5-liter V6 engine that  delivers 266 horsepower and 245 pound-feet of torque and drives the front  wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission. The  Sienna LE, XLE and Limited models can also be equipped with all-wheel drive.\nIn Edmunds testing of last year's model, a front-drive Sienna  Limited went from zero to 60 mph in a swift 7.5 seconds. The EPA fuel  economy estimates come in at 21 mpg combined (18  city/25 highway) for front-wheel-drive versions. Opting for all-wheel drive  drops those estimates to 19 combined (16/23). Antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control,  front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, a driver-side knee  airbag, a front passenger seat cushion airbag, active front head restraints and  a rearview camera are standard on all 2015 Toyota Sienna models.\nBlind-spot and rear cross-traffic monitoring systems and front  and rear parking sensors are available depending on the trim level. The Limited  can be had with a forward collision warning system. At our test track, last  year's Sienna Limited stopped from 60 mph in 127 feet, which is about average  for the minivan segment.\nIn government crash tests the 2015  Toyota Sienna received five  out of five possible stars, with four stars for overall frontal crash  protection and five stars for overall side crash protection. In tests by the Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety, the Sienna earned a top score of  \"Good\" for its performance in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset,  side-impact, roof-strength tests and head restraint (whiplash protection)  design. It received the second highest rating of \"Acceptable\" in the  IIHS test for small-overlap frontal-crash protection.  We've long been impressed by the Sienna's V6 engine and how  it delivers lively acceleration whether you're bopping around town running  errands or getting up to cruising speed on the freeway. The six-speed automatic  transmission does a great job of keeping the engine's thrust on tap, yet the Sienna  still manages to provide respectable fuel economy, provided you're not too aggressive  with the gas pedal.\nThe Sienna's ride quality is plush, but more controlled for  2015, and all versions offer competent handling. The SE's recalibrated suspension  and steering give it even more agility around turns. If you're used to driving  a car, the SE should make the switch to a minivan a bit easier. Its ride is  somewhat firmer, but certainly still comfortable. Lower trim levels of the Sienna are attractively decked out  with high-quality fabric upholstery, while higher-end models get leather along  with simulated wood cabin accents. Materials quality is very good, and the new  dash design is both more attractive and more functional. Seating is plush, and there's  abundant storage space along with user-friendly controls.\nOn the electronics front, every Sienna comes with a  user-friendly Entune touchscreen interface. Each features a similar easy-to-decipher  menu structure, but their screen size and the design of their surround buttons  can differ along with the number of features they control. These include a  navigation system and a suite of smartphone-connected services. There's also  the available rear-seat entertainment system, which features a split-screen  monitor that allows two different media (a movie on one side and a video game  on the other, for example) to play simultaneously -- thereby making it easier  to satisfy your backseat occupants.\nThe eight-passenger Sienna comes with a 40/20/40-split  second-row bench, and its center section slides close to the front seats for  easier access to the little one seated there. It can also be removed and stowed  within the van itself (unlike the Odyssey's, which you must find a place for elsewhere).\nWith a seven-passenger Sienna, you get specialized second-row  captain's chairs. Although their available La-Z-Boy-style footrests will  likely catch your eye during a test-drive, you'll also likely be impressed by their  ability to slide quite far fore or aft to increase sprawl-out comfort or cargo  space. Maximum cargo space stands at 150 cubic feet of cargo space, though to achieve  this you have to remove the second-row seats, which are quite heavy and awkward  to remove.\n\nYou can fit four  suitcases or a large stroller behind the third-row seat, while storage wells  corral smaller items. \n\nThese rear  captain's chairs are luxurious, but larger families will prefer an  eight-passenger Sienna with bench seating.\nThe  Sienna L includes 17-inch alloy wheels, a tow prep package, manual sliding rear doors, automatic headlights, cruise control, triple-zone automatic climate control, a  height-adjustable driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a  rearview camera, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, and a four-speaker  sound system with a 6.1-inch touchscreen, CD player, a USB/iPod interface and  an auxiliary audio jack.\nThe LE  adds roof rails, power-sliding side doors, privacy glass, heated mirrors,  upgraded exterior trim, floor- and overhead-mounted consoles, an eight-way power  driver seat (with power lumbar support), upgraded fabric upholstery, second-  and third-row sunshades, and a six-speaker sound system with a 7-inch  touchscreen, HD radio and satellite radio. All-wheel-drive versions get 18-inch  wheels.\nThe  sport-themed SE is equipped similarly to the LE but adds more aggressive  styling thanks to 19-inch alloy wheels, a unique front fascia (with foglights,  LED running lights and mesh inserts) and lower-body skirting. The SE also has sportier  suspension tuning, a power liftgate, perforated leather upholstery (for rows one  and two; row three gets leatherette premium vinyl), heated front seats and unique  gauges with a larger multipurpose display. The SE Premium adds a sunroof,  keyless ignition and entry, blind-spot and rear-cross-traffic warning systems, a  navigation system, Entune  smartphone app integration, a rear-seat entertainment system (with HDMI  inputs, RCA jacks, a DVD player and a large screen that can be split to display  two different sources) and the Driver Easy Speak system, which broadcasts the  driver's voice through the rear speakers. \nThe Sienna XLE shares many of the  SE trim's comfort and convenience equipment, but features similar suspension,  steering and styling to the LE. The XLE and XLE Premium, however, differ with a  four-way power front passenger seat and power-opening rear quarter windows.  When equipped with the seven-passenger seating configuration, the second row  captain's chairs feature extendable foot rests.\nThe plush Limited includes the XLE  Premium's features (minus the rear-seat entertainment system) along with  18-inch alloy wheels, a different grille, LED running lights, auto-dimming and  power-folding outside mirrors, front and rear sunroofs, front and rear parking  sensors, upgraded leather seating, driver memory settings, a heated steering wheel,  a power-folding third-row seat (FWD only), a navigation system and an upgraded  10-speaker JBL  surround-sound audio system. To all that, the Limited Premium adds automatic  wipers and the rear-seat entertainment system.\n\nThis is the larger of the two available touchscreen interfaces, and it  includes integrated smartphone apps.\nAlthough some of the upper trims'  features are available on lower trims as individual options, most optional  features are grouped into packages that vary based on trim level and where you  live in the United States. For the Sienna Limited only, the Advanced Technology  package adds adaptive cruise control and a forward collision warning system.",

    "full_description": "It's no secret that Americans don't buy  hatchbacks and station wagons en masse anymore. But the last two decades have  revealed that people really like them if they ride a bit higher, have optional  all-wheel drive and look more like an SUV \u2014 i.e., a crossover. The  outrageously successful Toyota RAV4 is a prime example, and now Toyota is  hoping you'll have a similar affinity toward the all-new 2018 Toyota C-HR.  \nThe C-HR is smaller and more affordable  than the RAV4. In fact, it was originally developed  for Toyota's now-defunct Scion brand, which largely explains the C-HR's  flamboyant styling and sporty handling. These two key attributes, along with  the extensive list of standard safety features, are the main reasons to  consider the C-HR in our opinion. Notably, we picked the 2018 Toyota C-HR as one of Edmunds' Best Small SUVs for this year. Consider the new 2018 Toyota C-HR if you're shopping for a subcompact crossover or hatchback. Its swoopy bodywork, sporty handling and many standard safety features distinguish it from other more utilitarian competitors. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based  on our full test of the 2018 Toyota C-HR XLE Premium (2.0L  inline-4 | CVT | FWD). The C-HR is one of the slowest vehicles we've tested, taking a considerable 10.6 seconds to reach 60 mph. Acceleration is characterized by a long hesitation between a pedal stomp and any forward motion. This is true whether you're stopped or trying to pass slower traffic on the highway. Coming to a stop from 60 mph required 119 feet, which is about average for cars in this class. In panic-braking tests, we experienced moderate nosedive and some residual bounce, but the C-HR tracked straight and remained controllable. In everyday driving, the brakes operate just as you'd expect. There's not much feedback coming through the wheel, but it feels direct and accurate in a sporty kind of way. At parking lot speeds, the effort is appropriately low and weights up as speeds increase. Sport mode makes effort a little too heavy. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that the C-HR is somewhat entertaining to drive on a twisty road, even with a not very powerful engine and a lack of grip from low-rolling-resistance tires. There's noticeable tire squeal under moderate cornering, and the tires really howl when pushed harder. The small footprint and turning radius make it easy to maneuver the C-HR into tight spaces. The transmission works fine, but it's relatively unremarkable. Though the C-HR is classified as a subcompact crossover, the low chin spoiler scrapes on parking blocks and many driveways. Even though there aren't a lot of adjustments, the front seats offer good padding and support to keep occupants comfortable over several hours. The fabric upholstery also breathes well in hot weather, eliminating the need for ventilation or cooling. For the most part, the C-HR delivers a comfortable ride. Smaller road imperfections are smoothed over as well as they are in other small SUVs, but there's a little jostling over moderate undulations. The C-HR is loud inside. There's a noticeable amount of wind noise, even below highway speeds. Road noise is also present and increases at higher speeds and over coarse asphalt. The engine drones like a wounded cow under hard acceleration, and we noted an annoying rattle in the back of the cabin. The simple controls for the dual-zone climate control make it easy to operate, and the overall performance is good. Once the system was set, we never felt the need to readjust it. The C-HR's simple layout is attractive, and the main controls are easy to operate for the most part. Some of the more advanced features, such as adaptive cruise control, were a little more difficult to figure out. Some staffers mentioned having to consult the owner's manual. Front passengers have easy seat access afforded by a slightly higher seating position, which makes slipping into the cabin a breeze. There's no climbing up or stooping down. Rear passengers need to dip their heads a little to clear the sloping roofline, a trade-off of the C-HR's sporty styling. The steering wheel doesn't telescope back far enough, even for average-size drivers. As a result, you have to sit closer and more upright than preferred. Drivers smaller of stature should be just fine. There's more interior space than you'd expect from such a small crossover. There's plenty of room up front in all dimensions. The rear seats can indeed hold regular adults in decent comfort. But the thick rear roof pillar and high windows might feel a little claustrophobic. Outward visibility is excellent thanks to the thin and well-profiled front roof pillars. The rear window is big enough to see all you need despite the big rear pillars. And there's very little guesswork when backing into a space so you won't have to rely on the tiny rearview monitor. The interior is well-designed and uses quality materials that exceed expectations for the class. Were it not for an annoying rattle in the back of the car, this score could have been higher. There's an acceptable amount of storage for your personal items, with small door pockets, decent-size cupholders, and a center armrest bin that is about average in size. The typical smart storage solutions that Toyota is known for are absent. With the rear seats in place, you have 19 cubic feet of cargo space, which splits the difference between the C-HR's primary competition. The maximum capacity is 36.4 cubes, which is significantly smaller than any other subcompact crossover. LATCH anchors are easily accessed, but a rear-facing child seat will require you to move the front passenger seat well forward. The audio system in the C-HR is decent but not at all impressive. It lacks some bass overall, but clarity is acceptable. The touchscreen mounted atop the dash is easy to read at a glance and operate with minimal distraction, too. Puzzlingly, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not offered. With no factory navigation available, this is even more odd to us because the touchscreen only controls audio. On top of that, we experienced occasional slowdowns in the system's response. We never had any frontal collision warnings, which either means it's well-tuned or not working (we're inclined to think it is working). Adaptive cruise control works well and operates down to a stop. The lane-keeping system is also good, but it only alerts you and doesn't steer you back in line. The voice controls worked pretty well, but considering that the system only operates the audio and phone, it's acceptable at best. The Toyota  C-HR is well-equipped in its base XLE form, with automatic headlights,  dual-zone automatic climate control and traffic-adapting cruise control all  standard. Considering the C-HR's high starting price (compared to the rest of  the class), you might be wary of paying more for the XLE Premium, our recommended trim. But it doesn't cost much more  than the XLE and includes desirable features such as heated front seats and a  blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert. We think it's worth  paying just a little more for the luxury and safety additions.  Every C-HR  is powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (144 horsepower, 139 pound-feet  of torque) matched to the front wheels through a continuously variable  automatic transmission (CVT). Standard features on the XLE include 18-inch wheels, automatic headlights with automatic  high-beam control, LED daytime running lights, a rear spoiler, remote locking  and unlocking, a driver information display, adjustable driving modes, a  rearview camera, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, height-adjustable front seats, a  60/40-split rear seat, a cargo cover, a 7-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, and a  six-speaker audio system with HD radio and a USB port. Several advanced safety  and convenience features are also standard, including traffic-adapting cruise  control, brake hold at stoplights, forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking, and lane departure warning and intervention.  Upgrading  to the XLE Premium trim gets you  foglights, keyless entry and ignition, power-folding mirrors, heated front  seats with two-way power lumbar for the driver, and\u00a0 blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic  alert.",

    "full_description": "Toyota now offers a slightly decontented \"standard\" Prius model that lacks cruise control and heated mirrors but in exchange has a significantly lower base price. The 2008 Toyota Prius is a full-featured midsize car that just so happens to be the most fuel-efficient car on the market. The fact that it now starts at less than $21,000 is icing on the green-colored cake. The 2008 Toyota Prius should be considered more than just a rolling personal statement declaring, \"Ahoy there you scummy SUV driver! I'm part of the solution, not the problem.\" Of course, people buy cars to make statements all the time. A stately luxury car can say, \"Look world, I'm successful.\" Buying a Hummer can say, \"This enormous 6,000-pound truck is synonymous with my (delusional) sense of personal machismo.\" Yet despite being the poster child for environmental awareness, the Prius should be closely considered for all the real, tangible ways it provides daily transportation. You don't have to bleed green to appreciate its virtues.Even without its innovative and revolutionary hybrid power plant, the Prius would be a sensible, functional-first midsize sedan. It may look small, but the well-packaged and airy interior is spacious for passengers and cargo alike. Plus, a long list of standard and optional features allows the Prius to serve both customers in search of a low-priced conveyance and those in need of more luxurious trappings.Of course, the Prius is first and foremost a hybrid -- and the benchmark upon which all others are based. Capable of running on electricity alone or in concert with the small gasoline four-cylinder engine, the Prius is capable of fuel economy that no current mainstream car can match -- even with the lower, revised 2008 EPA estimates. Like most hybrids, the 2008 Toyota Prius is best suited to drivers whose travels rarely take them farther than the city limits. Around town and in stop-and-go traffic, the Prius' electric motors and regenerative braking are optimized to provide superior fuel economy and optimal power delivery. It's OK on the freeway, but without consistent braking or coasting, the battery runs down, forcing the anemic four-cylinder engine to carry most of the load.In a few short years, the Toyota Prius has gone from low-volume oddity to being one of the 10 best-selling cars in America. With that popularity have come a slew of new hybrid models that generally trade a few miles per gallon for a more traditional body style. Toyota's own Camry Hybrid and the Nissan Altima Hybrid have gas-electric systems similar to the one in the Prius, but offer a more regular car-driving experience. The Altima can even be described as fun to drive, something few other hybrids --including the Prius -- can boast. The Honda Civic Hybrid is also a similarly priced alternative, providing more rewarding handling and a higher-quality interior.Despite this competition, though, nobody comes close to beating the Prius' mix of fuel economy, interior versatility and for 2008, a base price under $21,000. Plus, for better or worse, nothing else can make a better environmental statement. Powering the revolutionary Prius is what Toyota calls Hybrid Synergy Drive. This drivetrain consists of a 1.5-liter gasoline engine and two electric motors, one of which helps drive the front wheels and the other of which functions solely as a generator (recharging the car's battery pack). The gas engine produces 76 horsepower and 82 pound-feet of torque, while the electric-drive motor produces the equivalent of 67 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. Net peak horsepower is 110, mainly because the two power sources hit their peaks at different times. Regardless, power delivery is smooth and consistent from rest all the way to top speed. The Prius features a simplified continuously variable transmission of sorts. It provides the ease of a conventional automatic transmission, but there are no gears to shift, drive belts, torque converter or clutch. In performance testing, the Prius sauntered up to 60 mph in a leisurely 10.9 seconds.After the EPA revised its fuel economy testing procedures for 2008, the Prius and other hybrids suffered a perceived hit in gas mileage ratings. The Prius is now rated at 48 mpg city and 45 mpg highway. This is a far cry from the ridiculously optimistic former numbers (61 city), but they still represent the most fuel-efficient mainstream car money can buy. Every 2008 Toyota Prius comes standard with antilock brakes with brake assist, traction control, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags. Stability control is a package option. In government crash tests, Toyota's hybrid car earned four stars out of five for driver and front-passenger protection in frontal impacts. In side-impact testing, it earned five stars for front-occupant protection and four stars for the rear. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Prius earned the top rating of \"Good\" for its protection in frontal-offset and side-impact crashes. Driving a Prius is different. There is no engine start-up, just an instrument panel light that says \"Ready.\" The transmission selector is a stubby electronic knob. Thanks to its Hybrid Synergy Drive, the Prius can accelerate up to about 25 mph using only electric power, which can make it sound like a huge golf cart. It's all very different, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Star Wars was once pretty different, too. Aside from its idiosyncrasies, the Prius features minimal cabin noise and a suspension that provides an acceptably smooth ride despite the car's weight-saving chassis components. The Prius makes a fine highway companion, but it is best suited to the city, where its light electric steering, tight turning circle, excellent visibility and available rearview camera make it easy to park and maneuver through traffic. Also, this hybrid returns its best gas mileage in stop-and-go driving, as it's able to spend more time in full-electric mode. The overall look of the 2008 Prius is upscale, if not a little oddball. The dash is flat and wide, with a large touchscreen, digital gauges, stubby electronic shifter and plenty of steering wheel buttons. Climbing inside, you tend to feel as if you're about to take a trip inside Epcot's \"Car of the Future.\" Fit and finish is very tight and materials are pretty good, although some plastics are starting to seem a little cheap. We've complained before about centrally located instrument clusters, but the Prius' electronic gauges are at least crystal-clear and easy to see.Although the front seats are relatively roomy, the driving position in the Prius is somewhat awkward, as the driver seat is not height-adjustable and the steering wheel does not telescope. The backseat offers ample room for adults and rear-facing infant seats, while the 14.4-cubic-foot rear hatchback trunk can accommodate several roller suitcases or a double stroller. Plus, the folding seatbacks provide an uninterrupted cargo area that most sedans can't match. The Prius options list is extensive, capable of transforming this hybrid from an economy car to a near-luxury sedan. There are five packages available on the base and Touring trims (Packages 2 through 6 -- there is no Package 1), which bundle features that include a rearview camera, keyless ignition, HomeLink, foglamps, an auto-dimming mirror, leather upholstery and steering wheel, auxiliary audio jack, MP3 playback, Bluetooth, a navigation system and a nine-speaker JBL premium sound system with an in-dash six-CD changer. A choice of satellite radio providers is a stand-alone, dealer-installed option.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota 4Runner has been redesigned for 2010, bringing greater on-road refinement without giving up any of its traditional off-road prowess. Among go-anywhere traditional SUVs, the 2010 Toyota 4Runner is a top choice. However, those looking for more passenger space and who don't require much in the way of off-road capability may want to consider a car-based crossover SUV instead. Just over a quarter of a century ago, Toyota introduced the 4Runner. Back then, the term SUV referred to a truck-based vehicle designed to negotiate rugged trails and rocky peaks without breaking a sweat. These were the rigs of choice for campers, mountain bikers and skiers, not soccer moms or city slickers looking to make an image statement. Interestingly, the redesigned 2010 Toyota 4Runner stays true to these mountain-goat roots, courting real outdoor enthusiasts while leaving Toyota's various crossover and luxury utes to cater to the tenderfoots.The new 4Runner is based on the same platform used for the rugged FJ Cruiser, and it's taller, wider and longer than the previous model. Like all 4Runners, this one has a no-nonsense solid rear axle for superior off-road performance. One trick new feature this year is the available Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS), which can disconnect the front and rear stabilizer bars at speeds below 40 mph for greater wheel articulation over tough terrain. On the outside, the 4Runner has an edgy new look, with a blocky front grille and pronounced fender flares. Under the hood, the base engine is now a four-cylinder, marking the first time the 4Runner has offered one since 2002. We're not quite sure why Toyota bothered, as the inline-4 is only available on the base two-wheel-drive model, comes with an old-school four-speed automatic transmission, produces a lackluster 157 horsepower and gets basically the same fuel economy as the 4.0-liter V6.The vast majority of 4Runner buyers, we suspect, will want the V6, which has been tweaked to produce 270 hp (up 34 hp) and 278 pound-feet of torque (up 12 lb-ft) while remaining just as fuel-efficient as last year. However, the previous 4Runner's optional V8 is no longer offered, so those in search of maximum towing capabilities or simply the smooth power of a V8 will have to look elsewhere.Because of its focus on off-road adventure, the 2010 Toyota 4Runner can't quite match the real-world functionality of modern crossovers such as Toyota's own Highlander, the GMC Acadia or the Hyundai Veracruz. It comes surprisingly close, though, offering a healthy 90 cubic feet of cargo space and an available third-row seat. And while the 4Runner doesn't have the driving dynamics and fuel efficiency of these car-based SUVs, it does compare favorably to traditional SUV rivals like the Dodge Durango, Ford Explorer, Jeep Commander/Grand Cherokee and Nissan Pathfinder, lacking only that optional V8.Overall, Toyota has managed to maintain the 4Runner's strong off-road enthusiast appeal while making it a more practical daily driver. If you're looking for a vehicle that can do just about anything, this is one you won't want to miss. The 4Runner's forerunners would be proud. The 2010 Toyota 4Runner comes with either a four-cylinder engine or a V6, depending on trim level. The 2WD SR5 comes with a 2.7-liter inline-4 that makes 157 hp and 178 lb-ft of torque. All other models receive a 4.0-liter V6 with 270 hp and 278 lb-ft.A four-speed automatic is paired with the inline-4, while a five-speed automatic is fitted to the V6. The SR5 and Limited can be had in either rear-wheel or four-wheel drive (part-time system on SR5, full-time system on the Limited), while the Trail comes only with part-time 4WD. Towing capacity for V6 models is 5,000 pounds when properly equipped.EPA fuel economy estimates are remarkably similar whether the vehicle is powered by a four or a V6. The 2WD four-cylinder 4Runner rates 18 mpg city/23 mpg highway and 20 mpg combined. The 2WD V6 comes in at 17 mpg city/23 mpg highway and 19 mpg combined, while the 4WD V6 loses 1 mpg on the highway. All 2010 Toyota 4Runners come equipped with antilock disc brakes (with brake assist), stability control, traction control, active front head restraints, front knee airbags, front-seat side airbags and full-length roll-sensing side curtain airbags. If you choose the V6, power is satisfactory. At 8.2 seconds for the 0-60-mph sprint, the six-cylinder 2010 Toyota 4Runner is reasonably quick, and shifts from the five-speed automatic are prompt and refined. You can forget about the four-cylinder engine, though, which for some reason makes 30 less horsepower than the similar Highlander engine, despite the 4Runner's added weight -- and employs an outdated four-speed automatic instead of the Highlander's six-speed, resulting in a negligible fuel economy advantage over the V6.Despite being based on a traditional truck platform, the 2010 Toyota 4Runner boasts a smooth and controlled ride. When fitted with the X-REAS or KDSS, the 4Runner even delivers reasonably confident handling as long as you don't push it too hard. More impressive, of course, is the 4Runner's off-road ability. In testing, we've found that the combination of the 4Runner's 9.6 inches of ground clearance (4WD models) and KDSS works extraordinarily well in the dirt, making the 4Runner so nimble over lumpy terrain that we thought the tires were underinflated -- a good thing for off-roading. The Toyota 4Runner is roomier than it was before, and it offers spacious seating for five passengers, with the ability to seat two additional passengers in the optional third-row seats. The third-row seating is somewhat cramped, however, making it suitable for children or short adults only. Maximum cargo capacity is a useful 90 cubic feet. The optional sliding rear cargo deck takes up a little bit more space but can conveniently support up to 440 pounds.On the whole, the 4Runner's interior is handsomely designed, though materials quality has dipped from the previous generation's luxurious level. Still, it's a nice place to spend time, and the Limited's cabin offers many of the accommodations you'd expect in a Lexus. The various dials and switches are intuitive and well placed, while the voice-activated navigation and Bluetooth phone operation increase safety and reduce stress. New for this year is an \"ECO\" meter that lets you know whether you're driving in a fuel-efficient manner via a needle that moves into either the green (good) or red (bad) zone. Upgrading to the Trail (available only with 4WD and the V6) adds a hood scoop, a locking rear differential, Crawl Control (which automatically modulates throttle and brakes when ascending or descending hills), off-road-oriented tires, smoked head- and taillights, a back-up camera that displays in the rearview mirror, upgraded gauges, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, water-resistant upholstery, power front seats, a sliding rear cargo deck and an upgraded audio system with satellite radio, a USB port with iPod connectivity and Bluetooth phone and audio functions.The upscale Limited trim level adds 20-inch alloy wheels, Toyota's X-REAS adaptive suspension dampers, keyless entry and ignition, automatic headlights, dual-zone automatic climate control, an upgraded audio system with a six-CD changer and 15 speakers, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather upholstery, heated front seats and driver power lumbar support.Many of the Trail and Limited features are available as options for the SR5 model, though specifics will vary based on the region you live in. Other option highlights (depending on trim) include a sunroof, a voice-activated navigation system and a third-row seat. The aforementioned KDSS off-road suspension is available only on Trail models.",

With such a steady and diverse following for its compact sedan, Toyota usually undertakes major redesigns with a light hand: Although changes underneath the surface may be significant, each new Corolla invariably retains its predecessor's basic styling cues and overall driving demeanor. And so it is with the redesigned 2009 Toyota Corolla.That's not to say you won't appreciate the differences on the new Corolla. For instance, although it's not any longer or taller than last year's car, it rides on a wider track, and this opens up noticeably more hip- and shoulder room in the cabin. The addition of a telescoping steering wheel improves upon the Corolla's historically awkward driving position, while new features like an auxiliary audio input, keyless startup and a navigation system with real-time traffic updates bring Toyota's compact sedan into the 21st century in terms of feature content.Since fuel economy is another big reason people buy Toyota Corollas, most versions of this sedan continue to use an efficient 1.8-liter four-cylinder. This engine is heavily revised for 2009 and now features variable timing for both its intake and exhaust valves. Power increases are modest on paper, but the results are apparent on the road: In spite of a 200-pound weight gain, the 2009 Toyota Corolla is a touch quicker than the '08 model and capable of returning comparable gas mileage.Most of the Corolla's rivals offer larger engine options, though, and for '09, Toyota is following suit. The high-line XRS trim level returns to the model line, and it's motivated by a 158-horsepower, 2.4-liter inline-4, which promises to shave a second off the car's 0-60-mph time. In keeping with its heightened performance focus, the Corolla XRS has quicker steering, bigger wheels and a front strut tower brace.With two engines and five trim levels at their disposal, most 2009 Toyota Corolla buyers will have little difficulty equipping one to taste. Although competitors such as the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Mazda 3, Mitsubishi Lancer and Nissan Sentra offer comparable interior room and amenities, Toyota's compact sedan remains a fine choice for a commuter car given its composed ride quality, above-average gas mileage and high overall level of refinement. However, we question whether the company has done enough to meet increased expectations for performance and handling in this class. Even in sporty XRS trim, the '09 Corolla does little to engage its driver. Shopped against genuinely entertaining alternatives like the Mazda 3, Civic and Lancer, Toyota's economy sedan remains a tough sell. With the exception of the XRS, all 2009 Toyota Corollas are motivated by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 132 hp and 128 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed manual transmission driving the front wheels is standard, and a four-speed automatic is optional. You can look forward to 27 mpg city and 35 mpg highway EPA ratings with either transmission.Selecting the Corolla XRS entitles you to a 2.4-liter engine good for 158 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque. A five-speed manual is standard and a five-speed automatic is optional. Fuel economy drops significantly, with a 22/30 rating for both transmissions. Every Toyota Corolla comes with antilock brakes, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and active front head restraints. Stability control is standard on the XRS and optional on other Corollas. Only the XRS has four-wheel disc brakes; other Corollas have rear drums. Most buyers will be content with the base 1.8-liter engine, which delivers respectable acceleration in normal traffic situations. We recorded a 9.1-second 0-60-mph time in a manual-shift Corolla with the 1.8-liter, and our test car returned an impressive 29.8 mpg in mixed driving. Although the five-speed's shifter feels firm and decisive moving through the gates, we suspect its abrupt, at-the-floor clutch engagement will push many buyers to the automatic. Upgrading to the 2.4-liter engine provides a gratifying increase in low-end torque, though it does come at the expense of fuel economy.Regardless of which trim level you choose, the 2009 Toyota Corolla excels as a commuter car, as the suspension delivers a comfortable, controlled ride. Handling is uninspiring, however. Body roll is decently controlled, but the electric steering on non-XRS models provides so little feedback, you may find yourself making corrections simply to keep the car traveling in a straight line. Toyota retuned this setup for the XRS, and indeed its steering feels crisper and weightier. Driven on a back road, the Corolla XRS is undeniably a capable compact sedan, but compared to rivals like the Mazda 3, Civic and Lancer, it's not a very entertaining one. Cabin design is a strong point for the 2009 Toyota Corolla. The driving position better accommodates drivers of different sizes than in past years, and the control layout is as ergonomic as they come. Storage is more than ample up front, particularly with the addition of a double glovebox, though the provisions are a bit stingy in back. Materials quality is high, and fit and finish is consistent with Toyota's historically high standards. In back, the Corolla offers plenty of space for children and just enough room for adults. The trunk measures 12.3 cubic feet (average for this class) and has a wide opening. Essentially a luxury version of the LE, the new Corolla XLE also gets the 16-inch wheels and upgraded stereo while adding amenities like a sliding center armrest, wood-grain interior trim, electroluminescent gauges, keyless entry and variable intermittent wipers. The top-of-the-line XRS, meanwhile, builds upon the S model's equipment list. Although it forgoes some of the XLE's standard conveniences, it adds a larger engine, 17-inch alloy wheels, sport-tuned suspension and steering, a front strut tower brace, a rear deck spoiler and chrome interior trim. Cruise control is also standard on the XRS; it's optional on other Corollas.Heated mirrors and satellite radio are optional across the Toyota Corolla line, while the S, XLE and XRS are eligible for a sunroof, an upgraded JBL sound system and a navigation system (with real-time traffic). Leather upholstery is available on the S and XRS only.",

    "full_description": "For 2017, the Toyota Mirai is unchanged. If all you knew about the 2017 Toyota Mirai is that it's propelled by an  electric motor and stores its electrical energy in a battery, you'd be excused  for thinking it is a conventional EV. Yet the Mirai has no electrical charging  port with which to receive a charging cord. Instead, the electricity the Mirai  needs is generated onboard in a fuel cell, a device that takes in hydrogen gas  and outputs electricity. Water is the only byproduct.   The  Mirai's twist to the EV formula is that it delivers the benefits of  conventional EVs without being limited by a charging cord. Refueling with  hydrogen takes mere minutes, a fraction of the time required to recharge a  conventional EV. On the road, the Mirai delivers 300 miles of range, putting  most plug-in electric cars to shame. But don't go thinking there's a hydrogen  station on every corner. Even in California, which is the only state where the  Mirai is currently sold, hydrogen stations are few and far between.\nWhat's it like to live with?\nTo  learn more about the Toyota Mirai of this generation, read about our  experiences from six months of living with a 2016 Toyota Mirai. We cover  everything from seat comfort to real-world fuel economy, which is especially  important given the Mirai's hydrogen fuel cell powertrain. Is a fuel cell  vehicle worth the expense and inconvenience? Read through our Toyota Mirai long-term  test to see what we think. For those seeking the cutting edge in alternative-fueled vehicles, the hydrogen-fueled 2017 Toyota Mirai is here. It drives like an electric vehicle (EV) but delivers more range than any plug-in EV and takes mere minutes to refuel. However, hydrogen refueling stations are very scarce. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The  ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2016 Toyota Mirai four-door sedan (fuel cell hybrid; 1-speed direct  drive), which is identical to the 2017 model. There is nice pickup off the line due to the electric drivetrain's immediate torque delivery. But it never quite feels speedy, as demonstrated by its 9.1-second run from zero to 60 mph. Chalk it up to a hefty measured curb weight of 4,097 pounds. We measured a typical-for-EV 130-foot 60-mph panic stop due to skinny, low-drag tires and the aforementioned weight. The brake pedal feel is quite intuitive in normal driving \u2014 until someone cuts you off and you must act fast, at which point the response gets jumpy. Steering weight feels about right, neither too light nor too heavy. The Mirai generally goes where it's pointed without delay, but it lacks the feedback that lets a driver know exactly how much to turn the wheel to carve the intended path. The Mirai feels coordinated and balanced in daily use, and it is easy to maneuver in tight places. But it begins to feel like a heavy and somewhat narrow car on not-very-grippy tires if you quicken the pace. Better to not be in a big hurry. Direct-drive electric propulsion means acceleration is seamless with zero shifting. It just goes and goes. Not terribly quickly, you understand, but very smoothly. Handsome front seats are nicely sculpted and offer eight-way power adjustments, but the backrest could stand to have more give. Comfy rear seats are individual buckets with a console armrest in between. All four seats have two-stage seat heaters. The Mirai provides a smooth but not plush ride. Drive over some rough pavement, and you'll notice busy body motion now and again. It's generally pleasing, but it could stand a little more polish. The electric motor is very quiet, but the fuel cell and regenerative braking systems do generate occasional odd clicks and keening noises. Tire and wind noise is present in small amounts that will pass unnoticed by most. The touchscreen navigation/audio system is easy to use because of volume and tune knobs and because it responds quickly to touch commands. But its touch-sensitive climate temperature sliders and Prius-like central gauges are questionable. The wide-opening doors are inviting, and it isn't necessary to duck low to climb in up front. The story is much the same for the backseat passengers, but the roof does slope down a little more back there. You'll find ample head- and legroom up front, but the cabin tends to feel a bit narrow at the hip and elbow. Rear legroom is reasonable, but headroom starts to feel tight for those taller than 6 feet, and there are only two rear seats. The slender roof pillars, low door glass and rear three-quarter windows make for good forward and side visibility. A high cowl makes it hard to see the front of the car, but at least front and rear parking sensors and a rearview camera are standard. It's nicely put together, but the interior materials and general fit and finish look like the $32,000 car it would be if it had a gasoline engine, not the near $60,000 one it is because of the fuel cell hybrid-electric drivetrain. There is no front center console storage, so you'll need to use the modestly sized glovebox and small front door pockets to store your stuff. There is a rear console box, though. The trunk is moderately sized, but the rear seats do not fold down and there is no pass-through. What you see is all you've got. Sales  of the 2017 Toyota Mirai are restricted to California because the Golden State  is the only state with a hydrogen refueling infrastructure sufficient to  support a reasonable driving pattern. As a hydrogen fuel cell car, the Mirai is  a laboratory on wheels. Toyota is limiting the production of Mirais to a  relatively small number, so all Mirais will be equipped identically, with only  one trim level and no options. It comes pretty well equipped, though. All  Mirais have keyless ignition and entry, blind-spot monitoring with rear  cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, parking sensors, a navigation  system, premium audio, eight-way power-adjustable and heated seats and a heated  steering wheel. It's plenty comfortable. The fuel cell electric powertrain develops 151  horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. In our testing, the 4,000-pound sedan  accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 9.1 seconds. That's leisurely, but in  real-world driving at sub-freeway speeds, the Mirai has agreeable thrust. The  EPA gives the Mirai a 66 mpkg estimate. The Honda Clarity rates 67 mpkg.

    "full_description": "For 2014, the Toyota Avalon is essentially unchanged other than minor adjustments to standard feature content. With its upscale styling, welcoming cabin and impressive full economy, the 2014 Toyota Avalon Hybrid earns our respect as a top choice for a fuel-sipping full-size sedan. As the established leader of the hybrid car movement, Toyota saw fit  to expand this gas-saving technology to its popular full-size sedan, the  Avalon. As such, the 2014 Toyota Avalon Hybrid offers excellent fuel economy  for a large sedan combined with all the amenities and style of the standard  Avalon, which was redesigned just last year. \nAccordingly, the Avalon Hybrid has the same sharp, sweeping  look that might have you mistaking it for a European luxury sedan. Inside, the  handsome, roomy cabin boasts high-quality materials and all the latest luxury  and convenience features. Underneath it all is a well-sorted suspension that  provides surefooted handling along with a comfy ride. \nThe heart of the 2014 Toyota Avalon Hybrid is the same  powertrain found in the Camry Hybrid: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine  paired with an electric motor. It pumps out a respectable 200 horsepower  combined. More importantly, it allows this big sedan to earn an EPA-estimated  combined fuel economy rating of 40 mpg. Factor in the 17-gallon gas tank and  you're looking at a theoretical range of nearly 700 miles between fill-ups. \nThe Avalon Hybrid also happens to be pretty much in a class  by itself, as no non-premium brand automakers currently offer full hybrid  systems in their large sedans. A mild-hybrid version of the 2014 Buick LaCrosse is available, but its fuel  economy and overall driving demeanor can't match the Avalon's. If you don't  need quite as much room, you might consider a midsize alternative, such as the Ford Fusion Hybrid (or its cousin, the Lincoln  MKZ Hybrid), the Honda Accord Hybrid or Toyota's Camry  Hybrid.\nAll the midsizers are a little smaller inside than the  Avalon, though they do boast even higher fuel economy (except the Camry). And  don't discount 2014 Volkswagen's Passat TDI (diesel)  as another,  less costly alternative with lower mechanical complexity. It earns 34 mpg  combined and up to 40 mpg on the highway. Overall, though, the 2014 Toyota  Avalon Hybrid's excellent fuel economy, distinctive styling and accommodating cabin  make for a pretty impressive package. The 2014 Toyota Avalon Hybrid is powered by a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor that's fed by a  trunk-mounted battery pack. Combined, the two power units are good for 200 hp.  A continuously variable transmission (CVT) delivers power to the front wheels. \nAccording to EPA estimates, the Avalon Hybrid returns 40 mpg  combined (40 mpg city/39 mpg highway). In Edmunds performance testing, an  Avalon Hybrid Limited accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds. This is  about a second slower than the regular Avalon or most other conventional large  sedans, but average for a hybrid sedan. Standard safety features include traction and stability  control, antilock disc brakes, front- and rear-seat side airbags, side-curtain  airbags and front knee-airbags. The Limited comes with blind-spot monitoring  and rear cross-traffic alerts (optional on the Touring). Also standard on the  Limited is Toyota's Safety Connect service, which includes roadside assistance,  stolen-vehicle location and automatic collision-notification. The Limited's  optional Technology package includes a frontal pre-collision warning system.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Avalon Hybrid stopped from 60  mph in 132 feet -- about 5 feet longer than average for the segment.\nIn government crash tests, the Avalon Hybrid received a rating  of five stars out of five for overall crash protection, with four stars for  frontal-impact protection and five stars for side-impact protection. In testing  by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the otherwise similar non-hybrid  Avalon scored a rating  of \"Good\" -- the highest possible -- in the moderate-overlap  frontal-offset, side-impact and roof-strength crash tests. The  Avalon's seat/head restraint design was also rated \"Good\" for  whiplash protection in rear impacts. Your first thought when driving the 2014 Toyota Avalon  Hybrid might be one of mild surprise, as the big sedan feels more responsive  and surefooted than previous Toyota Avalons. The steering is somewhat slow, but  still feels reassuringly precise during typical driving maneuvers. Overall, the  Avalon Hybrid just feels easy to drive. The one significant gripe we have is  that the brakes can feel grabby under light braking until you acclimate to  them. \nThe hybrid model's 200-horsepower rating isn't a whole lot  for a big car like this, but for the most part, acceleration is perfectly  adequate. The Avalon Hybrid is also exceptionally quiet, equaling the hushed  demeanor of a large luxury sedan while cruising at highway speeds.  The Avalon Hybrid's interior is spacious and elegant, with  high-quality materials throughout. The front seats  are very comfortable and highly adjustable, with plenty of side bolstering and  lumbar support for both the driver and the front passenger. As you'd expect for  this class of car, the Avalon's rear seats are quite roomy. \nThe Touring and Limited come standard with Entune, a suite  of smartphone-connected services and apps that includes features like the Bing search engine, Pandora streaming radio, real-time traffic  and sports and stock information. Getting  started with Entune is a hassle, since you have to install an app on your phone,  register for an account, and you always need an active data connection to use  it. In addition, the car has to be parked to access many of Entune's apps (many  of which you probably already have installed on your smartphone). Finally, the  touchscreen interface has straightforward menus, but it's sometimes  unresponsive to user touch.\nStorage compartments provide ample room for drinks and  personal effects. The lower section of the center console provides a convenient  \"eBin\" with power cords passing through a sliding panel for two cell  phones and auxiliary and USB connections. A large center armrest provides more  storage space and additional connectivity and charging for cell phones. The  trunk offers 14 cubic feet of space, which is less than the regular Avalon but  still more than what's available from the typical midsize hybrid sedan. \nThe XLE Premium comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels,  automatic headlights, heated mirrors, a sunroof, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, dual-zone automatic climate control, full power accessories, cruise  control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, leather upholstery, an  eight-way power driver seat with power lumbar support, a four-way power front  passenger seat and heated front seats. Electronic features include keyless  ignition/entry, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a rearview camera, a 6.1-inch touchscreen display  and an eight-speaker audio system with a CD player, an auxiliary audio jack and  a USB/iPod interface.\nThe XLE Touring adds foglights, driver seat and side mirror  memory functions, a navigation system and Toyota's Entune smartphone app integration  system.\nThe Limited includes the above and adds xenon headlights,  auto-dimming side mirrors, rain-sensing wipers, blind-spot monitoring, rear  cross-traffic alerts, upgraded leather upholstery, a 10-way power driver seat,  an eight-way power passenger seat, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats,  tri-zone automatic climate control, a rear power sunshade, hard-drive based  navigation, a 7-inch touchscreen display and an 11-speaker JBL premium sound  system. \nSome of the upper trims' features are available as options  for the lower trims, while the Limited also offers the available Technology  package which includes adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlight  control and a forward collision warning system.",

    "full_description": "The 2010 Toyota Avalon gains standard rear-passenger auto up/down windows. Its price of entry may be higher than those of its rivals, but if you're looking for a refined, well-built full-size sedan in the $30,000 price bracket, the 2010 Toyota Avalon is a top-notch choice. The full-size sedan is as American as apple pie, baseball and Chuck Norris. It was the preferred vehicular choice for decades when gas was cheap, space was abundant and the crossover sport-utility was but a glint in Jeep's eye. As full-size sedans have shrunk from those land yacht days of yore, this most American of automobiles has been defined in recent years by a Japanese car: the Toyota Avalon. Providing a space-efficient interior, abundant luxury features, strong performance, solid crash test scores, thrifty fuel economy and a refined ride, the Avalon has been the bar that competitors have been expected to clear.The 2010 Toyota Avalon is in the twilight years of its current generation, but it still remains a benchmark for the class. Riding on a stretched version of the previous-generation Camry platform, the Avalon has front-wheel drive and a virtually flat rear floor that allows three adults to sit abreast in comfort. Despite looking smaller from the outside than many of its full-size sedan rivals, the Avalon offers more space in most interior dimensions. The backseat in particular is a lavish place to spend time, with a standard reclining seatback, abundant headroom and an available power rear sunshade.Another bright spot for the Avalon is its standard 268-horsepower V6 engine, a variation of the same power plant available throughout Toyota's lineup that delivers an impressive balance of power and fuel economy. Indeed, the Avalon's ability to accelerate more rapidly than similarly powered competitors while still returning 22 mpg combined could be a deal maker by itself.However, it's not entirely bright and sunny in the land of Avalon. For starters, Toyota's biggest sedan is more expensive than comparably equipped competitors like the Buick LaCrosse and Ford Taurus, which were both completely redesigned and thoroughly improved for 2010 to better compete in the full-size segment. The Avalon also lacks its American competitors' design flare inside and out, which could be a deciding factor among buyers who remember the grandiose glory days of full-size sedans. So while the 2010 Toyota Avalon remains at the top of its game, it finally has serious competition to deal with. The front-wheel-drive 2010 Toyota Avalon is motivated by a 3.5-liter V6 rated at 268 hp and 248 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard. The EPA's fuel mileage estimates for the Avalon stand at 19 mpg city/28 highway and 22 combined, making it one of the most fuel-efficient full-size sedans available. Standard safety equipment on the 2010 Toyota Avalon includes antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, active front head restraints, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and a driver-side knee airbag.In government crash tests, the Toyota Avalon earned a perfect five stars in all frontal- and side-impact categories. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Avalon earned the top score of \"Good\" for its protection of occupants in frontal-offset and side-impact crashes. Not surprisingly, the 2010 Toyota Avalon is at its best on the open highway. The cabin remains quiet, the ultra-smooth V6 engine has plenty of passing power and the suspension swallows up road imperfections without drama. The Avalon is no athlete, though, so those interested in a slightly more involved driving experience should consider the Buick LaCrosse. The Avalon's steering is too light to feel sporty, but it at least responds to driver input in a precise, fluid manner. Additionally, a tidy turning circle makes the Avalon feel unexpectedly maneuverable on tight city streets. The Toyota Avalon's interior feels upscale and inviting thanks to its glowing Optitron gauges, attractive and ergonomic control layout and high-quality materials. Movable panels conceal the radio and navigation controls when they're not in use, giving the dash a sleek appearance. However, to truly achieve the luxury feel the Avalon is known for, we suggest opting up to the XLS or Limited. The front seats are wide and accommodating -- with the Limited, you also get heated and ventilated seats with a seat-cushion length adjuster. The rear seats are quite comfortable as well. Legroom is abundant even by full-size sedan standards, and the rear seats boast a manually reclining back that allows passengers to stretch out on long trips. A 6-footer can sit in back with more than enough knee- and headroom, and with a nearly flat floor, getting three into the backseat on carpool day is no problem. One minor annoyance is the inability to fold the rear seats (the trade-off for the reclining feature). The trunk measures 14.4 cubic feet, smaller than what's available in other full-size sedans. Toyota's options are grouped into packages, but their content and availability differs by region. Among options available on the XLS are a power passenger seat, heated front seats, driver memory functions and the JBL stereo upgrade. The XLS and XLT can be equipped with a voice-activated navigation system. Adaptive cruise control is only offered on the Limited.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota Tacoma enters 2008 with no changes. Very capable and able to suit just about anyone, the 2008 Toyota Tacoma is an ideal choice for a versatile midsize pickup. Always at the head of the pack with consumers, and indeed one of our editors' segment favorites, the Toyota Tacoma midsize pickup sees no changes for 2008. Evidently, Toyota is a firm believer in the \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" philosophy.Completely revamped three years ago and sometimes referred to as a compact pickup, the current-generation Tacoma is actually more of a midsize. Versatility is the Tacoma's calling card, as a wide variety of cab styles, bed lengths and trim levels allow one to configure anything from a base standard cab work truck to a luxurious crew cab family truck with stout hauling and towing capabilities.So great is the Tacoma's choice of body styles that should you opt for a Double Cab (crew cab) with a long bed, this once-small pickup will boast a wheelbase and overall length greater than a full-size domestic with a short bed.Also impressive is the Tacoma's roomy cabin and array of practical features, such as a scratch- and dent-resistant composite cargo bed that has built-in storage units, adjustable tie-down anchors and even an optional 400-watt electrical outlet. This Toyota's available 236-horsepower V6 may not have class-leading power, but the spec sheet doesn't indicate the smooth and usable broad spread of power it provides.All things considered, the Tacoma is a well-rounded pickup that has no significant weaknesses. Its versatile nature, impressive build quality, strong reliability history and pleasant driving dynamics have earned it two successive Editors' Most Wanted awards. Though we also suggest taking a look at another favorite of ours -- the Nissan Frontier -- the 2008 Toyota Tacoma is easy for us to recommend to those shopping for a compact or midsize pickup truck. The regular and Access Cab models can be had with either four- or six-cylinder engines, while the Double Cab models use the V6 exclusively. The standard 2.7-liter, four-cylinder engine makes 159 hp and 180 pound-feet of torque. The 4.0-liter V6 engine pumps out 236 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. With the inline-4, one may choose either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic. Those who opt for the V6 are offered a six-speed manual or a five-speed automatic.Even saddled with the additional weight of four-wheel drive and a long bed, a Tacoma Double Cab V6 we tested sprinted to 60 mph in just 7.8 seconds, giving it the distinction of being one of the quickest midsize trucks available. Rear-wheel or four-wheel drive is offered for all body styles. Properly equipped, the Tacoma can tow 6,500 pounds. Antilock brakes with brake assist are standard, while a stability control system is optional. Double Cab models also offer optional front-seat side airbags as well as full-length head curtain airbags. Hill-start assist control (HAC) and downhill assist control (DAC) are provided for 4WD models equipped with an automatic transmission, stability control and the Off-Road package.In government testing, the 2008 Toyota Tacoma received a top five-star rating for its protection of occupants in frontal and side-impact crashes. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Tacoma its top rating of \"Good\" for offset-frontal impact protection. While the standard four-cylinder engine is certainly adequate, the big V6 is worth upgrading to. The V6 is a strong all-around performer, with plenty of pull down low and a willingness (albeit a somewhat noisy one), to spin into the upper rev ranges. Plus, towing heavy loads poses no problem for this powertrain. In terms of handling, the 2008 Toyota Tacoma feels like a true truck from behind the wheel. It excels in off-road situations and is reasonably comfortable on the street. But depending on how it's equipped and whether it's carrying a load or not, the Tacoma can seem skittish or bouncy at times. Although the Tacoma's interior isn't particularly fancy, it provides plenty of practicality and comfort. The gauges are clear and the controls are easy to operate. Storage space is plentiful, and the Double Cab's rear seat is comfortable for adults. However, some drivers might take issue with the positioning of the driver seat, feeling that it's mounted too low to the floor. For hauling cargo, a non-rusting and dent-resistant composite cargo bed comes standard on all models, while an optional bed-mounted 115-volt/400-watt electrical outlet is ideal for campers and outdoor sports enthusiasts. All body styles are available in both two- and four-wheel drive. Should one desire the rugged look and suspension of a four-wheel-drive truck without the added weight, maintenance and fuel appetite of actual four-wheel-drive running gear, there is the PreRunner version, which is capable of handling light-duty off-road work. On the other end of the spectrum is the street performance-oriented X-Runner.Tacoma regular cabs are meant primarily for workhorse duty and as such are sparsely equipped -- standard features include a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, twin auxiliary power outlets and a four-speaker CD stereo. The Tacoma Access Cab comes with air-conditioning, an overhead console and a six-speaker sound system. The Tacoma Double Cab adds keyless entry, full power accessories and upgraded upholstery.Most options are grouped in available packages.

    "full_description": "For 2018, Toyota has added a new TRD Sport trim. All Sequoias now have LED headlights and additional standard safety features, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. A restyled grille and gauge cluster round out the changes for 2018. The  2018 Toyota Sequoia is worth a look if your transportation needs require a  heavy-duty three-row SUV. It offers seating for up to eight people, legitimate  off-road and towing capabilities, and substantial cargo room. The Sequoia is  capable of doing just about anything. But  the current-generation Sequoia has been around for 10 years without a redesign.  That's a long time in the automotive industry, and it's mostly apparent in the  Sequoia's dated interior design, lack of refinement and subpar fuel economy.  It's a tough sell when other big crossover SUVs can provide similar amounts of  interior room to the Sequoia but with superior fuel economy and a better  combination of ride comfort and secure handling.Still, as traditional SUVs go, the Sequoia offers a more comfortable ride than  many in its class, especially when equipped with the Platinum trim's air  suspension. It's also pretty capable off-road thanks to its substantial ground  clearance, though obviously this isn't a vehicle you'll want to try to squeeze  down a tight, narrow trail. Overall, the Sequoia isn't our top pick for a big  three-row SUV, but there are enough positives that it's worth considering. Need a big vehicle that can tow? The 2018 Toyota Sequoia answers the call. This three-row traditional SUV has a stout V8 and plenty of towing capability. If you're looking for the latest in design and efficiency, though, newer and more advanced competitors offer more of what you need. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions, although trim levels share many aspects. The ratings in this review are based  on our full test of the 2017 Toyota Sequoia  Platinum (5.7L V8 | 6-speed automatic | 4WD). The strong 5.7-liter V8 never feels strained, even when summoned to pass slow traffic at highway speeds. In our testing, the Sequoia dashed from zero to 60 mph in 7.1 seconds. That's nearly 1 second slower than a 4WD Nissan Armada but still stacks up well with other competitors. Pedal feel is soft and comfortable, but it firms up nicely during panic braking. ABS panic-brake stops are noisy and jittery as the steering wheel darts from side to side while the SUV comes to rest. Emergency stopping distances are average for a big SUV. Typical big-boat steering feel, as in not much at all. Not much feedback from the road and a loose wheel feel due to too much assistance and a lot of vague, sloppy play. Just place faith that your tires are pointed where you want to go. You can't expect much given the Sequoia's size, but it surprises with a decent amount of handling precision. The margins are slim, of course. Too tight a corner (most of them) and too much speed (almost any) will make the tires beg and squeal. Still, a perverse pleasure in trying to drive one fast. With light steering and a smooth-shifting automatic transmission, the Sequoia is very easy to drive. The light gas pedal feel doesn't match the immense power generated underhood. It feels large but doesn't \"drive\" large. Surprisingly good agility, like a sumo wrestler who excels at football drills. It's capable in true off-road conditions thanks to 10 inches of ground clearance, large approach angle and low-range transfer case. The driver can lock the center differential from the seat for improved traction on loose surfaces. But its large size will keep it off tight trails. The first- and second-row seats are wide with no lateral support, but sitting for several hours brought no complaints. Lack of front seat adjustments is disappointing. Third-row seats are flatter and more shapeless, but that's expected given that they need to be folded down for cargo carrying. Plush ride absorbs impacts and shrugs off smaller bumps, but plenty of bob and weave when driving over larger potholes or when whipping around a parking lot. Soft, but driver isn't totally isolated from the road. Negligible differences between Comfort, Normal and Sport adjustable suspension modes. It's very quiet at idle. Some wind noise at highway speeds as air rushes over the stubby, upright front end. The engine sounds strained when you really get on it. It does the job, but other V8s (Chevrolet, GMC) sound better doing it. Blows seriously strong and seriously hot or cold. Four large knobs and integrated buttons control climate functions. The second row gets temp, fan and mode controls. Front seats have three-stage heating and cooling, but airflow and cooling are weak even on highest setting. Two-stage heating for second-row seats. The cupholders and stereo controls require a long arm to reach. The dashboard and center stack feature a patchwork of buttons and knobs, some with cryptic labels like \"Sonar.\" Most are easy to decipher. Front passengers will often need to sit upright and lean to make adjustments. Getting into the Sequoia's first two rows requires a step up, but running boards and grab handles help. The second-row seats tilt and slide, making for easy third-row entry, but getting out requires a limber, deliberate effort, especially for tall adults who'll need to crouch to clear the roof. The driver's seat offers surprisingly little downward adjustment, and taller drivers may sit higher than they like. The power tilt-and-telescoping steering column is nice, but this SUV also needs power pedal adjustment to bring those pedals closer to the feet of shorter drivers. Plenty of room for heads, arms, elbows and shoulders all around. The captain's chairs make the second row as roomy as the front. The third row is a bit narrow for three adults, although there's enough legroom. It's fine for short trips, but you don't really want more than six adults in this SUV. Big windshield aids driver's view, but the big, bulbous hood makes it hard to discern space around the front end. Thick front pillars, large mirrors hamper view through turns. Side visibility is good for safe lane changes, and large rear window helps for backing up. Rearview camera is a necessity. The Sequoia's cabin materials are outclassed by its rivals. We don't doubt the durability, but the oversized knobs, pulls and handles and hard-touch plastic make it feel more like a Tundra pickup and less like a more affordable Lexus. Toyota's indifference to keeping the Sequoia fresh is obvious. The Sequoia offers so many nooks and cubbies that some personal items will disappear forever. There are door pockets, door panel channels, coin trays, slide-out bins, deep center consoles and dual gloveboxes. There are at least two cupholders for each occupant, although most are comically small. Arguably the key reason you buy a Sequoia. With 120.1 cubic feet of maximum space, it's only beat by the longer Chevrolet Suburban and Ford Expedition Max. With the seats up, it offers an impressive 67 cubes with just the third row folded and 19 cubes of room for groceries with the third row up. LATCH anchors are hidden behind a Velcro-backed flap at the base of the seat cushion and seatback. Easily accessible and nicely hidden from view, they are close enough to the surface to avoid or minimize abrasion between the car seat and upholstery. A 4WD Sequoia Platinum like our test vehicle can tow up to 7,000 pounds. It's plenty, though a couple rivals boast even higher capability. A Tow/Haul mode optimizes shifts while towing. The Sequoia 4WD Platinum's payload capacity is 1,300 pounds, which is a couple hundred pounds less than some rival SUVs can handle. With six big adults in the car, you're almost at the limit. A load-leveling suspension helps handle weight. The 6.1-inch touchscreen is tiny, dated and not high-resolution, despite Toyota's claims. Inexplicable given rival interfaces and those in recent Toyotas. Nav software does the job, but graphics are also outdated. Good power and clarity from JBL audio system, but bass seems exaggerated for effect. Just the basics: Bluetooth, one USB port and one auxiliary audio jack. No Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Bluetooth pairing is easy and offers browsing of device's audio library. Single-screen rear DVD entertainment system is more robust and may make passengers forget about their iPads for a while. The 2018 Sequoia has a comprehensive set of features this year, including adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, forward collision warning, auto emergency braking and lane departure warning. Native voice controls are limited to navigation functions and audio control. Worked well for navigating to specific addresses, not so well for recognizing points of interest or accessing audio files from device library. iPhone users can access Siri functions by holding down the talk button. We  like the value presented by the SR5 with Premium Package. Thanks to standard  safety and driver assist functions this year, its features list is comparable  to (or even better than) those of other base-level SUVs. Getting the Premium  package is key since it adds desirable features such as leather upholstery,  heated front seats and a power rear liftgate. The base SR5 model comes stocked with a healthy number of standard features.  Highlights include 18-inch wheels, LED headlights, a sunroof, a power rear  window, tri-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable driver seat, a  40/20/40-split second-row bench seat (with sliding and reclining  functionality), a 60/40-split reclining and fold-flat third-row bench, second-  and third-row retractable sunshades, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, a USB port,  a 6.1-inch touchscreen, and an eight-speaker audio system with a CD player and  satellite and HD radio.Standard safety features for the SR5  include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane  departure warning, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera,  blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and traffic-adapting cruise  control.An  optional SR5 Premium package bundles an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather  upholstery, a power-adjustable passenger seat, heated front seats, a power  liftgate, a power reclining and folding third-row seat, and an integrated  navigation system.Complete  information on the TRD Sport was not  available as publication, but Toyota has said it will come with a sport-tuned  suspension, 20-inch wheels and special exterior styling details.Compared  to the SR5, stepping up to the Limited model  gets you 20-inch wheels, power-folding and auto-dimming exterior mirrors,  upgraded gauges and everything from the SR5's Premium package.A  seven-passenger option swaps the second-row bench for two captain's chairs. A  14-speaker premium JBL sound system (bundled with driver memory settings) is  optional, as is a rear-seat entertainment system with a Blu-ray player. The  top-of-the-line Platinum trim level  comes standard with all of the above features, plus an adaptive air suspension  (with a load-leveling rear), ventilated front seats, heated second-row  captain's chairs (reducing seating capacity to seven), a second-row center  console and a power-adjustable steering wheel",

    "full_description": "For 2017, the Highlander receives a number of significant midcycle changes. The styling has been updated, highlighted by a larger, more pronounced grille and redesigned LED taillights. The V6 engine is new, boasting more power and better fuel economy along with an eight-speed transmission and an automatic stop-start system. New feature content includes the Toyota Safety Sense technology suite, which comes standard on every trim level. There's also a new SE trim level that features uniquely sporty styling elements and a retuned suspension for sharper handling. The  well-rounded 2017 Toyota Highlander does just about everything you're probably  looking for in a three-row family SUV. It's one of our top choices in a tough  segment devoid of stinkers and should definitely be on your must-drive list.  The  Highlander has a just-right size for many families. It's not too cumbersome to  maneuver, yet its interior should offer more than enough space for growing  broods. Its new V6 engine \u2014 standard on most trims \u2014 also  impresses with capable acceleration and comparatively good fuel economy, while  the driving experience strikes a good balance between comfort, isolation and  driver feedback. You're also likely to appreciate the Highlander's well-made,  versatile cabin, which gains an additional four USB ports for 2017 \u2014  your power-hungry kids will certainly approve. Then there's the newly standard  Safety Sense package, with technologies such as autonomous braking to help  avoid or mitigate collisions.  At the  same time, with so many appealing three-row alternatives on the market, we  highly recommend cross-shopping the Highlander with top competitors. The  Toyota's many virtues \u2014 including its strong reliability reputation  and resale value \u2014 may make it seem like a slam dunk, but this  vehicle class is just too strong for a one-and-done shopping process. Try a few  out and see which one feels best to you. The well-rounded 2017 Toyota Highlander does just about everything you're probably looking for in a three-row family SUV. Its manageable size, well-made cabin, powerful and efficient engine, easy tech controls and pleasant driving experience are standouts. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions,  although trim levels share many aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2014 Toyota Highlander XLE (3.5L V6 | 6-speed automatic | AWD). NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Highlander has received some  revisions, including a new V6 engine with an eight-speed automatic transmission  and additional feature content. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this  year's Highlander. The Highlander's V6 already provided impressive acceleration in 2014, and the new V6 only improves upon that. The new eight-speed automatic is smooth and reasonably responsive. Despite a vague-feeling pedal, the Highlander provides substantial braking effectiveness \u2014 the panic-stop distance from 60 mph in Edmunds testing ranks among the class best \u2014 and very good fade resistance. About as good as it gets for a large SUV. It has intuitive response and reassuring feedback when cornering and isolated straight-line stability on the highway. And it's a cinch to park. A confident and competent handler, right up to the relatively low limit set by the stability control system, which really lets you know when you're asking too much. The new SE model's sport-tuned suspension provides a firmer ride but only minor handling improvements. The Highlander feels bigger than some competitors when behind the wheel, so tighter parking maneuvers may feel hairy. It has nice-and-easy steering for parking lots, though, and indeed this is a very easy SUV to drive in general. No low-range gearing, but a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system, 8 inches of ground clearance, hill hold and hill descent control, and advantageous approach/departure angles give the Highlander admirable off-road capabilities for a family hauler. Heated leather front seats are as comfy as furniture and offer tons of adjustment, including extendable thigh support. Second-row seats are firmer, but they slide and recline in a wide range. The third row is merely acceptable; certain competitors are better. One of the Highlander's best qualities is its ride comfort. This crossover is highly isolated and confident without feeling like a floating barge. Few if any road irregularities intrude. One of the quietest SUVs we've ever measured. Only an occasional wisp of wind noise is evident on a gusty highway pass. Some controls, specifically those for the audio system, are located too far away. Otherwise, Toyota's typical array of controls is easy to use. It can be difficult to reach the third row, as the second row (be it captain's chairs or the bench) doesn't provide a wide path to the way back. The doors are large, though, and the seats are of a reasonable height. Abundant seat adjustments, including power-adjustable thigh support (a rare feature) on most trim levels. Sufficient seat and telescoping-wheel travel for taller drivers. As is true of most competitors, the first and second rows provide copious room for adult occupants. The third row is squishier than that of the Honda Pilot despite having three seat belts \u2014 only small kids are likely to fit three abreast back there. Quality of materials is high, and during the course of our one-year long-term test of a Highlander, everything in the cabin remained nicely screwed together. Impressive. There's a unique built-in shelf on the dashboard that serves as a resting place for phones or other personal items. A vast amount of space is found under the sliding armrest cover \u2014 it's big enough to store a laptop or a sizable purse. The Highlander offers an average amount of cargo capacity for the segment, regardless of how many rows are in place \u2014 nothing significantly outdoes it. Others are better behind the third row, however, notably the Ford Explorer. A properly equipped Highlander V6 can tow up to 5,000 pounds, which is essentially the standard for the segment. To beat that, you'll need a more rugged alternative such as the Dodge Durango. Toyota's touchscreen interfaces aren't the flashiest or most feature-packed, but they are easy to use. The 8-inch version (standard on most models) is notably quick to respond to inputs and features large, easily pressed icons. Every 2017 Highlander comes standard with forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, along with adaptive cruise control and lane departure intervention. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are included on the XLE on up. For starters, we do not recommend the  base LE with its standard four-cylinder engine, which is much slower than the  V6 and less efficient, too. Although you can specify the V6 on the LE, our  favorite model is the one-step-up LE  Plus. It includes the V6 and all the necessities, as well as niceties such  as a flip-up rear window, tri-zone climate control, an eight-way power driver  seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, an 8-inch touchscreen and a power  liftgate. Fancier models provide garnishes such as leather upholstery and  heated front seats, but we'd only wish for keyless entry and ignition (XLE and  up).  The base LE comes standard with a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine (185 horsepower, 184  pound-feet of torque), a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel  drive. The 3.5-liter V6 that's standard on all other trims (295 hp, 263 lb-ft)  is optional on the LE and comes paired with an eight-speed automatic. All-wheel  drive can be added to the V6 as an option. Other standard feature content  includes 18-inch alloy wheels, heated mirrors, a windshield wiper de-icer, rear  privacy glass, the Toyota Safety Sense bundle (automatic high beams, adaptive  cruise control, lane departure intervention, and forward collision mitigation  with automatic emergency braking), a rearview camera, rear air-conditioning, a  six-way manually adjustable driver seat, cloth upholstery, a 60/40-split  second-row seat (slides, reclines, folds), a 60/40-split third-row seat  (reclines, folds), five USB ports, a 6.1-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, and a  six-speaker sound system with a CD player, auxiliary audio jack and a media  player interface. The LE Plus adds a height-adjustable power liftgate, a flip-up rear window, foglights,  tri-zone automatic climate control, upgraded upholstery and trim, an eight-way  power driver seat with lumbar adjustment, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a  higher-resolution 8-inch touchscreen, satellite and HD radio, and a variety of  smartphone-connection apps. The XLE adds  a sunroof, roof rails, keyless entry and ignition, blind-spot monitoring and  rear cross-traffic alert systems, an upgraded instrument panel, leather  upholstery (first and second rows), simulated leather third-row upholstery,  heated front seats, a four-way power passenger seat, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, second-row window sunshades, Driver Easy Speak (carries the driver's  voice through the rear speakers to distant passengers) and a navigation system.  The SE is  equipped similarly to the XLE but has LED running lights, sport-themed styling  elements and suspension tuning, 19-inch wheels and sporty interior trim.  The Limited starts  with the XLE's content and adds LED running lights, different 19-inch wheels,  rear parking sensors, a rear cargo cover, heated and ventilated front seats,  driver memory settings, second-row captain's chairs (optional on the XLE) and a  12-speaker JBL audio system.  The Limited  Platinum gains a panoramic sunroof, automatic wipers, a 360-degree parking  camera, front parking sensors, Safety Connect emergency communications, a  heated steering wheel and heated second-row seats. The Limited and Limited Platinum can be optionally  equipped with the second-row bench. A rear-seat entertainment system (9-inch  display, DVD player, RCA jacks, wireless headphones) is optional on all but the  LE and LE Plus.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota Venza gets the slightest of styling tweaks for 2013. More importantly, it gets additional standard features such as blind spot mirrors for the base LE, driver memory functions for the XLE and LED running lights for the Limited. A touchscreen interface is now standard on all Venzas, while Toyota's Entune suite of smartphone-based services has been added to the list of available features. The 2013 Toyota Venza is hard to define, but whether you call it a wagon or a crossover, it's a competitive and comfortable family vehicle. If Toyota doesn't have the largest and most diverse selection of trucks, SUVs and crossovers, we're not sure who does. There are utilitarian mommy-mobiles, rugged and retro off-roaders and enormous cross-country haulers. Then there's the 2013 Toyota Venza, which seems to exist for people who can't make up their minds. Part wagon and part crossover SUV, this five-passenger family car can be considered alongside any number of different vehicles.\nOnce you're perched in its driver seat, the Venza feels a little wagon-esque. Though it has a raised ride height, you don't get quite a commanding view of the road. It's more like the 2013 Subaru Outback in this way. However, it does feel more carlike, both in terms of visual perception and driving experience.\nA pair of growing teens in the reclining rear seat will find plenty of sprawl space, while once joined by a friend, the three of them will discover the rear seat is just wide enough for their shoulders as well. Plus, a composed ride and quiet cabin give the Venza a grown-up feel that compact crossover SUVs such as the Chevrolet Equinox do not offer. In terms of space and cabin ambience, the Venza is more like a 2013 Ford Edge or Nissan Murano. Similar cargo capacities further the comparison.\nOf course, being \"like\" those aforementioned vehicles doesn't make the 2013 Toyota Venza equal to them in every way. The Outback is more rugged, the Edge gives you a more commanding view of the road and the Equinox is cheaper and better for hauling stuff. Is the Venza an intriguing alternative, however? Absolutely. Every 2013 Toyota Venza trim is available with a four- or six-cylinder engine mated to either front- or all-wheel drive. All versions feature a six-speed automatic transmission.\nThe 2.7-liter inline-4 produces 181 horsepower and 182 pound-feet of torque. In Edmunds performance testing, a four-cylinder, front-drive Venza went from a standstill to 60 mph in 9.3 seconds -- this is an average time for four-cylinder compact crossovers like the Toyota RAV4. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 20 mpg city/26 mpg highway and 23 mpg combined. The all-wheel-drive version gets 22 mpg combined. These estimates are not all that great compared to those same compact crossovers, but the Venza does at least offer the option of four-cylinder power.\nThe 3.5-liter V6 produces 268 hp and 246 lb-ft of torque. In Edmunds performance testing, an all-wheel-drive Venza V6 accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 6.9 seconds. This is considerably quicker than both compact  and midsize SUVs. At the same time, fuel economy is almost identical to that of the four-cylinder, at an EPA-estimated 19 mpg city/26 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined with front-wheel drive and 18/25/21 with all-wheel drive.\nWith the optional towing package, the Venza V6 can tow 3,500 pounds. Every 2013 Toyota Venza comes standard with antilock brakes, traction and stability control, front side airbags, side curtain airbags and a driver knee airbag. A rearview camera is optional.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Venza came to a stop from 60 mph in 122 feet, which is an average distance.\nIn government crash testing, the Venza received four out of five stars for overall protection, with three stars for overall frontal-impact protection (four stars for the driver but just two stars for the front passenger) and five stars for side protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gives the Venza the best possible rating of \"Good\" in the frontal-offset, side and roof-strength tests. It shouldn't come as a shock that the 2013 Toyota Venza is hardly a wagon in the style of sporty European models. Instead, the Venza is very American -- designed for comfort, utility and ease of driving. If it weren't for the vague feel of its electric-assist steering, the Venza might actually be interesting to drive instead of merely pleasant. While the base four-cylinder engine delivers adequate power, we'd recommend paying extra for the V6. Not only does it provide quicker acceleration than its myriad competitors, but also its fuel economy is almost equal to that of the four-cylinder. The 2013 Venza doesn't quite exhibit the top-notch interior quality of past Toyota models or its midsize SUV competitors, but the overall design is rather fetching and practical, with a sleek center console that features a high-mounted shift lever for the transmission which frees up space between the seats. This allows for a large console bin, generously sized cupholders and smaller bins perfect for smartphones and other personal effects.\nWhile the Venza's audio controls are more complicated than those found in past Toyotas, the new-for-2013 touchscreen interface is one of the best available. We appreciate its ability to mix and match FM/AM/XM radio presets, and the accompanying steering-wheel-mounted controls are well conceived. For those with more high-tech tastes, the Venza also can be equipped with Toyota's new Entune system. By connecting the car to a smartphone via Bluetooth, it allows you to control Pandora radio, buy movie tickets or reserve a restaurant table through the car's touchscreen.\nFrom a practical standpoint, the volume of the Venza's passenger and cargo room is consistent with the Subaru Outback, as well as midsize crossovers like the Ford Edge and Nissan Murano. There is plenty of legroom in the reclining backseat, and there is a decent amount of space for three abreast. The driver seat is a little less comfortable, however, and it could use a greater range of adjustability. The cargo area can swallow 70 cubic feet of stuff with the rear seats folded and a healthy 34.4 cubes with the seats up. \nThe LE comes standard with 19-inch wheels, automatic headlights, foglamps, a windshield wiper de-icer, privacy glass, a blind-spot mirror, keyless entry, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, an eight-way power driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, reclining rear seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a cargo cover, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, and a six-speaker sound system with a touchscreen interface, a CD player, an auxiliary audio jack and an iPod/USB audio interface. The V6-powered Venza gets 20-inch wheels.\nThe LE Convenience package adds a power liftgate and a rearview camera. The LE Preferred package adds these items plus a panoramic sunroof and Toyota's Entune suite of smartphone-based app services.\nThe XLE trim includes the Convenience package items, plus keyless ignition/entry, heated front seats, driver seat memory functions, a four-way power passenger seat, leather upholstery, Entune, satellite radio and HD radio with iTunes tagging. The XLE Premium package adds the panoramic sunroof, a larger touchscreen interface, a navigation system, real-time traffic (plus other services) and a 13-speaker JBL sound system.\nThe Limited includes the Premium package items plus bi-xenon headlights, automatic high beams and LED running lights. There is a tow package available on all V6-powered Venzas.",

    "full_description": "The Tundra continues into 2006 without major changes, though an adoption of new and more accurate SAE engine measuring procedures by Toyota has resulted in a slight drop in the amount of stated power for the V6 and V8 engines. If you have to drive a truck everyday and heavy-duty towing isn't a concern, the 2006 Toyota Tundra should be in your driveway. The Tundra, Toyota's full-size truck, has been on sale since 2000. The Tundra competes against the Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra twins, the Dodge Ram, the Ford F-150 and the Nissan Titan. The Tundra has been a successful vehicle for Toyota. Early on, Toyota figured out that a V8 engine was vital to any full-size truck's sales success in this country. They also discovered that many pickup trucks are actually used for serious work and play, meaning that payload and towing capacities had to be increased. Lastly, Toyota realized that consumers expect certain things when they buy a Toyota truck: excellent build quality, class-leading reliability and well-designed interiors. The 2006 Toyota Tundra largely meets those requirements, especially when ordered in the Double Cab version. At the end of the day, the Tundra still isn't as big and strong as the domestic trucks or the Titan, nor does it have the usual mind-numbing array of features and options. But for many people, those extras could be superfluous. Toyota's first full-size truck is a very good one, especially for the general consumer rather than the contractor or construction worker. However, the company is well aware that there are plenty of people who would buy a bigger, more powerful Tundra, and you can expect the second-generation Toyota truck, due for 2007, to be a true full-size in dimensions and strength. Two dual-overhead-cam engines are available on the Toyota Tundra: a 4.0-liter V6 and a 4.7-liter V8. The V6 makes 236 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque, while the V8 musters 271 hp and 313 lb-ft of torque. The V6 comes with either a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. The V8 is offered with the five-speed automatic only. Either engine can be had with four-wheel drive. Maximum towing capacity is 7,100 pounds. ABS is standard. Side-impact airbags for front occupants and full-length side curtain airbags with a rollover sensor are optional on Double Cabs. In government frontal-impact crash tests, the 2006 Toyota Tundra received a four-star rating (out of five) for driver protection and five stars for front-passenger protection. The Toyota truck earned a perfect five stars for front-occupant protection in side impacts. The IIHS gave the truck a \"Good\" rating (its best) for frontal-offset crashes. The V6 has adequate power for light-duty use, while the V8 can certainly handle everyday driving and basic towing and hauling jobs. However, when asked to pull heavier loads, the V8 tires more quickly than the larger engines in the Tundra's competitors. Smaller than other full-size trucks, the 2006 Toyota Tundra is more maneuverable in crowded areas. The standard suspension is softly tuned. It makes the Tundra more comfortable for commuting than most peers, but less suitable for serious hauling. Although bland in appearance, the aging interior remains functional thanks to its simple control layout. Materials quality is solid but unimpressive for a Toyota. The Access Cab's rear-seat area is smaller than the quarters in other full-size extended cabs. The Double Cab's 60/40-split rear seat boasts legroom on par with its domestic competitors. Unfortunately, the narrow cab makes for tight shoulder room. The 2006 Toyota Tundra is available in regular, extended- (Access Cab) and crew-cab (Double Cab) versions. Regular cabs come only as long beds, while Access and Double Cabs come only as short beds. Access Cabs have reverse-opening rear doors for easier rear-seat access, while Double Cabs feature four full-size doors and, thanks to their longer wheelbase, equal bed length. There are three trim levels: base, SR5 and Limited. Available only on regular cabs, the base trim's amenities are limited to antilock brakes, 16-inch steel wheels, a cloth bench seat and a CD player. The SR5 adds body-color bumpers, a chrome grille and air conditioning; V8-equipped models also get cruise control. Available with a V8 only, the Limited offers alloy wheels, an in-dash CD changer and power windows, mirrors and locks; many of these features are optional on the SR5. On the options list, there's a towing package, a cold-weather package, an off-road package and a sport suspension package. On Limited trucks, there are optional leather captain's chairs with a power driver seat. A DVD entertainment system is available for Double Cab models.",

    "full_description": "For  two decades, the Toyota Prius has been the go-to choice for both eco-warriors  and drivers simply looking to save money on fuel costs. But new rivals are  debuting every year, and even the mighty Prius must innovate to stay on top.  Last year, Toyota made some changes to bolster the Prius' appeal, such as  improving the cabin materials and adding optional all-wheel drive. This year,  the 2020 Toyota Prius continues the theme of improvement with a revised  touchscreen and \u2014 finally \u2014 the introduction of Apple  CarPlay.  This  generation Prius offers a comfortable ride quality, roomy seating and generous  cargo space. Acceleration is no more than adequate, but it might be worth the  trade-off if it means you only have to fill up once or twice a month. Though  estimates vary slightly by trim, the EPA rates the Prius at 50 mpg or higher in  combined driving.  Overall,  we applaud Toyota's commitment to keeping the Prius fresh. But that isn't to  say it's the best. Its sluggish acceleration is no longer the punchline it once  was, but rivals are quicker and only marginally less fuel-efficient. We  particularly suggest checking out the Honda Insight for its more satisfying  performance and more traditional styling. Other options might include the new  Corolla Hybrid or the Kia Niro. \nNotably, we picked the 2020 Toyota Prius as one of Edmunds' Best Gas Mileage Cars for 2020.\nWhat's it like to live with the Prius?\nTo learn more about the Toyota Prius of this generation,  read about our experiences from living with a 2016  Toyota Prius.  After its debut, we went out and bought one, holding onto it for almost four  years and racking up more than 30,000 miles. We cover everything from this  hybrid's real-world fuel economy to seat comfort and cargo space. Please note  that the 2020 Toyota Prius differs from our long-term 2016 model in that the  newer model has updated styling and more standard features. It's the same  generation, though, so most of our observations still apply.  The  base L Eco is value-heavy, with a healthy list of features for a reasonable  price. That said, we think the next-level LE is the smart pick. The LE doesn't cost much more than the L Eco and  includes thoughtful additions, such as a cargo cover, rear wiper, a blind-spot  monitor, and parking sensors. Automated parallel parking is also equipped,  which is an extraordinarily rare feature at this price level. How does the Prius drive? You're not buying a Prius to get engaging performance. In Edmunds testing, our all-wheel-drive Prius test car covered 0-60 mph in 10.5 seconds, which is among the slowest cars around, hybrid or not. (Perhaps somewhat paradoxically, the lighter, front-drive Prius was marginally slower.) The Prius is also pretty tepid when it comes to agility and handling precision.\n\nWe do like the Prius' easy-driving nature and its smooth transitions from electric motor drive to gasoline engine power. Another Prius advantage is its available all-wheel drive. It should be noted, though, that the rear wheels only intervene when the front wheels lose traction. So in most dry-weather scenarios, you'll never feel them working. How comfortable is the Prius? The front seats are softly padded. Most drivers will find them comfortable for the long haul, though taller drivers or those with long legs might find the seat bottoms to be a few inches too short. The cabin is generally quiet unless you floor the gas pedal, at which point the engine gets rather raucous.\n\n   Another downside is the Prius' ride quality over broken pavement and concrete expansion joints. The impacts from these types of bumps can make the car feel jittery. Since the car is so quiet, these bumps are perhaps more noticeable than they'd otherwise be. How\u2019s the interior? The Prius is a fundamentally easy car to get into and drive. Aside from the shifter, all other controls will feel immediately comfortable to the majority of drivers. Most drivers should also be able to find a comfortable driving position thanks to the seat's wide range of adjustability. \n\n   We wish there was more telescoping range in the steering wheel, however, and most of the instrument panel information is not in the driver's line of sight. The 11.6-inch screen on the top-tier Limited model has most of the car's climate control settings and buttons in on-screen submenus. From an ease-of-use standpoint, it seems like a step backward from the dedicated physical buttons on lower Prius trim levels. How\u2019s the tech? As advanced as the Prius is from a powertrain standpoint, it can seem a little odd that it comes up short in in-car tech. Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa integration is standard across all trims, but Toyota still doesn't offer Android Auto. The standard infotainment system looks and feels dated too. Even the big 11.6-inch screen on the top-tier Limited model seems like a gimmick since Toyota doesn't do much to take advantage of the larger space.\n\n   The Prius, however, comes with a full suite of advanced driving aids standard. Most of them work well, and the adaptive cruise control can bring the Prius to a complete stop. But you shouldn't use it in stop-and-go traffic. It tends to be too conservative on acceleration and too aggressive on braking. The driver behind you won't be a fan of this herky-jerky style. How\u2019s the storage? Thanks to its cavernous hatchback cargo area and fold-down rear seatbacks, the Prius is quite useful for carrying luggage, groceries or whatever else you want to put back there. Up front, there's enough in-cabin storage for the daily odds and ends, and the cupholders securely hold beverages under the circumstances in which most Priuses are typically driven. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Prius is known for its frugal use of gasoline. The EPA estimates a range of up to 56 mpg in combined city/highway driving for the Eco trim level or down to 50 mpg with all-wheel drive. In our own fuel economy testing of a couple of Prius test cars, we've been able to verify that the EPA's estimates are achievable in real-world driving. Is the Prius a good value? The Prius' interior feels well-built even if some cabin materials are a little too plasticky. It's still one of the best vehicles for fuel economy, and the AWD version delivers some extra assurance for drivers who live in snow country. \n\n   As for warranties, Toyota gives you its regular coverage, which includes a longer duration (eight years or 100,000 miles) for the hybrid components. You also get Toyota's two free years of scheduled maintenance. The Prius isn't exciting to drive or filled with luxury features. Instead, the Prius is all about being easy-to-drive, practical, comfortable and, of course, saving on gas.",

    "full_description": "The RAV4 has been fully redesigned for 2006, boasting a larger overall size and available V6 power. With available V6 power under the hood, nimble handling on the street and a generous standard features list, the Toyota RAV4 is a top compact SUV choice for 2006. In the mid-1990s, the Toyota brain trust took a close look at the SUV market and determined that not everybody liked the idea of piloting a 3-ton land yacht in order to take advantage of the \"U\" in SUV. File drawers full of focus group questionnaires pointed toward a vehicle that combined the advantages of a sport-utility -- great visibility, sizable cargo capacity, all-weather capability -- with the manageable size and drivability of a car. \nWith that in mind, Toyota's designers looked past their bulky truck frames and gas-guzzling engines and came up with a car-based SUV that merged trucklike utility with carlike maneuverability. Introduced in 1996, the Toyota RAV4 (Recreational Active Vehicle -- four-wheel drive) combined sporty good looks, a convenient size and an economical engine into an attractive and affordable package. It was an instant hit, and as the first example of a car-based sport-utility, the RAV4 enjoyed phenomenal sales that brought with them an onslaught of new competitors hoping to cash in on the newfound niche. Vehicles like the CR-V and Grand Vitara soon hit the market sporting bigger engines and more refined interiors, promptly shuffling the aging RAV4 toward the bottom of the category it had single-handedly created. This led to the second-generation Toyota RAV4, introduced for 2001, which bolstered the RAV back into the top of its class. But time marches on, and the competition has continued to improve. \nThe 2006 RAV4 marks the third generation of Toyota's compact SUV. Only now it's not so little anymore, as nearly all dimensions have grown. The styling is less busy than before and the RAV4 has a more serious, chiseled look. There is a certain premium feel of the new cabin with fewer hard plastics. The rear seats are not only split and able to recline, they also slide back and forth 6.5 inches to allow either passenger space or cargo capacity to be optimized. A third-row seat is optional. Big changes lie under the hood, as well. In addition to a standard four-cylinder engine, a 269-horsepower V6 is optional. A redesigned suspension system delivers a fine balance between comfort and control. In sum, the 2006 Toyota RAV4 has finally stepped up from being a \"cute 'ute\" to a fully functional crossover SUV. Both front-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive (4WD) versions of the RAV4 are available. The 4WD system automatically sends torque to the rear wheels when a loss of traction is detected. Standard power is provided by a 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine that delivers 166 horsepower and 165 pound-feet of torque. A 3.5-liter V6, which boasts 269 hp and 246 lb-ft of torque, is optional. Automatic transmissions are standard -- the four-cylinder gets paired with a four-speed automatic, while the V6 gets a five-speed unit. When equipped with the optional towing package, the V6 RAV4 can tug 3,500 pounds. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes are standard, as is Toyota's VSC stability control system and traction control. RAV4s with 4WD or the optional third-row seat are equipped with Hill-start Assist Control and Downhill Assist Control. Side airbags for front occupants and full-length side curtain airbags are optional. The redesigned Toyota RAV4 has not yet been crash tested. Intended for a life on pavement, the 2006 Toyota RAV4 really shines in this environment. Its taut suspension and quick steering make daily commutes or errands much more enjoyable than what would otherwise be the case in a traditional SUV, and the RAV4's ride quality is still pretty comfy when driven over broken pavement. Most drivers will be perfectly satisfied with the standard 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine as it provides adequate power for day-to-day driving. The optional 269-hp V6, meanwhile, is full of swagger. So equipped, the RAV4 can embarrass quite a few modern sport coupes in terms of acceleration. As usual, all controls are simple and straightforward to use. The overall feel is upscale, with less hard plastic than previous RAVs, electroluminescent gauges like a Lexus' and an illuminated cupholder. The rear seats recline, and can slide forward or rearward 6.5 inches to allow either passenger space or cargo capacity to be optimized. Normal seating capacity is five; the optional third-row seat bumps it to seven, though this seat is truly meant only for children. To configure the RAV4 for cargo, all one has to do is flip a lever to instantly get a flat load floor. No removing headrests or flipping up seat cushions for the second-row seating is required. With its flat load floor, the RAV4 can hold a maximum of 73 cubic feet of cargo. The four-door Toyota RAV4 is a midsize crossover SUV offered in three trim levels: base, Sport and Limited. Standard features for the base trim include 16-inch wheels, air conditioning, cruise control, a height-adjustable driver seat, a tilt-and-telescope steering wheel, a CD stereo with MP3 capability and power windows, mirrors and locks. Above this, the RAV4 Sport has 18-inch alloy wheels and wider tires, a sport-tuned suspension, color-keyed overfenders, and a roof rack. The top-line Limited includes 17-inch alloy wheels, a roof rack dual-zone automatic climate control, a power driver seat and upgraded audio with a six-disc CD changer. Many of these features are available as options on the base trim. Other options include a third-row seat, a moonroof (Sport and Limited only) and, for the Limited, leather seating and a DVD-based rear entertainment system.",

    "full_description": "Toyota's perennially best-selling family sedan gets a complete makeover for 2007. Among the highlights are a roomier interior, additional luxury-oriented features, an available 268-hp V6 coupled to a six-speed automatic transmission, and a gasoline-electric hybrid model that earns EPA fuel economy estimates of 43 mpg city/37 mpg highway. While it still won't win the title of \"world's sexiest family sedan,\" the new 2007 Toyota Camry's combination of comfort, refinement and reliability will very likely allow it to keep the title belt for \"America's best-selling sedan.\" Anyone shopping in this segment will want to give the Camry consideration. In our experience, buyers of family sedans are usually looking for a car that provides a roomy and comfortable interior, a refined driving experience and a reputation for reliability. While most modern sedans meet these qualifications, only two have excelled over the past decade: the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry. For much of that period, the Toyota Camry has held the sales advantage, and it's been America's best-selling sedan for eight of the past nine years. Now, for 2007, Toyota has fully redesigned the Camry, and we have no doubt that it will continue to appeal to a large section of buyers.As it has done with each generation before, Toyota has increased the Camry's size and power for 2007. A 2.2-inch-longer wheelbase and 1.2-inch-wider front and rear tracks provide benefits in terms of interior space and rear-seat legroom. Underneath the new car, one will find the familiar MacPherson struts up front and a dual-link independent rear suspension. Spring rates and suspension geometries were completely revised, however, to give the car a sharper feel without compromising ride quality. Wheel size has gone from 15 to 16 inches on base models, while the sportier SE trim gets its own set of 17-inch aluminum wheels. For the outside, the car receives a full styling refresh. Toyota describes the new Camry's look as \"athletic and elegant\" and \"styled in a way that is certain to elicit a positive emotional response.\" But we're not so sure. To our eyes the front end is a bit heavy looking with its bulbous nose, while the somewhat drooping head- and taillights are simply odd. This year also ushers in changes for the Camry's available powertrains. For the power-inclined, there's a new 268-horsepower V6 that gives the Camry sport-sedan performance. As far as features, even the base-level 2007 Camry comes nicely equipped, with power windows, cruise and a CD player all standard. And all trims include a standard tire-pressure monitoring system. Moving all the way up the Camry line will get you Lexus-like luxury with elegant cabin furnishings and available high-end luxury features, such as a navigation system and Bluetooth wireless capability.All of these evolutionary changes have made the 2007 Toyota Camry a very appealing choice. Of course, it's not the family sedan for everybody. The Hyundai Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and comes with a better warranty. The Volkswagen Passat is more prestigious to own. The Chrysler 300C has a thumping V8. The redesigned 2007 Nissan Altima, when it arrives, will likely boast superior handling performance. And there's still the very impressive Accord. But for the mainstream part of the family-sedan segment, the new Camry has set the bar even higher in regards to features, performance, reputation and price. Yes, you get what you pay for, and in this case that turns out to be a new benchmark in the highly competitive family sedan market. Standard on all trim levels is a 2.4-liter inline four (158 horsepower and 161 pound-feet of torque) paired to either a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. A potent 3.5-liter V6 (268 hp and 248 lb-ft) mated to a new six-speed automatic gearbox (that offers manual-shift capability) is available on the LE, SE and XLE trims. With the V6, the Camry can reach 60 mph in just 6.5 seconds. Every Camry comes with seven airbags (dual-stage front airbags, front-seat side and full-length side curtain airbags and a driver knee airbag), a tire-pressure monitor and antilock brakes with BrakeAssist (BA) and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD). Stability control (which includes traction control) is optional across the line. A quiet, soft ride still characterizes the Camry's on-road demeanor, though this year's revisions give the handling dynamics a slightly sportier feel. Still, the overriding impression is one of refinement and a somewhat isolated feel from the road compared to more athletic competitors like the Mazda 6 and Nissan Altima. Toyota knows that the majority of buyers in this market segment are more interested in comfortable, stress-free travel than tearing through corners, and the refined and very capable 2007 Camry should once again prove to be a hit with them. In addition to more space for passengers, the 2007 Toyota Camry offers other features that increase cabin comfort. XLEs with cloth upholstery have a unique treatment using silkworm cocoon extract that coats the fabric, making it very soft to the touch. Additionally, XLE rear-seat passengers can recline their seatbacks. All Camrys have a trip computer, larger instruments than before and a dual-tiered dash that makes for a more spacious feel. Plenty of cubbies and compartments serve to hold CDs, cell phones and garage cards. The Camry's trunk holds 15 cubic feet of cargo. The 2007 Toyota Camry comes as a midsize four-door sedan in five trim levels. The base CE counts 16-inch wheels, air conditioning, power windows and mirrors, cruise control, a tilt and telescoping steering wheel, and a six-speaker audio system with a CD player and auxiliary input jack as standard equipment. The Camry LE adds keyless entry and an eight-way power driver seat. The SE includes a sport-tuned suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels, and special interior and exterior styling details. The luxurious XLE pampers its occupants with a 440-watt JBL sound system that incorporates Bluetooth technology, a moonroof, wood-tone accents, reclining rear seats, an automatic dual-zone climate control system with a high-tech air filter and, on the V6 model, leather seating. The various trim levels should satisfy most buyers' needs, however, a few key options are available, such as stability control and, on the XLE trim, a navigation system and heated seats.",

    "full_description": "There are no significant changes for the 2013 Toyota Tundra. The 2013 Toyota Tundra remains a capable workhorse among full-size pickups, but lacks the refinement that newer rivals benefit from. A tundra, by definition, is a treeless zone in the far  northern reaches with a subsoil that is permanently frozen. It's doubtful that  when Toyota named its full-size pickup truck it had any sort of negative connotation in  mind. But the 2013 Toyota Tundra is starting to take on some of its namesake's attributes.\nOn the surface, the Toyota Tundra has seen some growth  throughout the seasons, but underneath it has remained largely unchanged since  the current model debuted six years ago: frozen solid, if you will. Meanwhile,  the Tundra's competitors from Ford and Ram have evolved and adapted to the  shifting automotive landscape.\nAs a result, the 2013 Toyota Tundra is notably outdated when  it comes to refinement. Its interior lacks the modernity that other  manufacturers have infused into recent redesigns. Ride quality is also a bit  behind the times, with a comparably choppy ride. To top it off, the Tundra  feels like the big truck it is, whereas its rivals may feel smaller and more  maneuverable behind the wheel.\nFortunately, it's not all frozen and barren wasteland for  the 2013 Toyota Tundra. At its core, it delivers the kind of strength and  utility that define the full-size pickup category. A variety of body styles and  features allow buyers to tailor their purchase to their needs, as does the  availability of three engines that range from adequate to brawny.\nIf refinement comes as an afterthought to workhorse duties,  the Toyota Tundra remains a worthy alternative. For overall ability with more  pleasant surroundings and manners, however, we'd point shoppers toward the 2013 Ford F-150   and 2013 Ram 1500, both of which received more  recent redesigns and updates. Like the Toyota, the 2013  Chevrolet Silverado 1500  (and its GMC Sierra twin) is due for a makeover, but it remains competitive  thanks to a well-rounded and capable nature. The 2013 Toyota Tundra  is offered with a choice of three different engines and rear-wheel drive or  four-wheel drive.\nRear-wheel-drive  Regular and Double Cabs are powered by a 4.0-liter V6 that puts out 270 horsepower  and 278 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed automatic transmission is standard.  EPA-estimated fuel economy for this powertrain is 16 mpg city/20 mpg highway  and 17 mpg combined.\nA 4.6-liter V8 that  produces 310 hp and 327 lb-ft of torque is standard on CrewMax, four-wheel-drive  and long bed models, and available as an option on rear-wheel-drive Regular and  Double Cab body styles. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard. In  Edmunds testing, a four-wheel-drive Tundra with the 4.6-liter V8 went from zero  to 60 mph in 7.9 seconds. EPA-estimated fuel economy for this engine is 15 mpg  city/20 mpg highway and 17 mpg combined with two-wheel drive and 14/19/16 mpg with  four-wheel drive.\nTopping the Tundra's  engine lineup is a 5.7-liter V8 standard on Limited and Platinum trim levels  and optional on the other models. It produces 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque,  while a six-speed automatic transmission is standard. EPA-estimated fuel  economy is 13 mpg city/18 mpg highway and 15 mpg combined for two-wheel-drive  models and 13/17/15 mpg for four-wheel-drive versions. A four-wheel-drive  Tundra CrewMax with this engine went from zero to 60 mph in 6.9 seconds in  Edmunds testing. Tundras equipped with the 5.7-liter V8 and the optional Tow  package can pull trailers up to 10,400 pounds. The 2013 Toyota Tundra  comes standard with antilock brakes (with brake assist), stability and traction  control, trailer sway control, front side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags  that cover both rows and front knee airbags. In Edmunds brake testing, a Tundra  Double Cab with the 4.6-liter V8 came to a stop from 60 mph in 134 feet -- an  average distance for a full-size truck.\nIn government crash  tests the Tundra earned an overall score of four stars (out of a possible  five), as well as four stars for overall frontal protection and five stars for  overall side protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the  Tundra its highest rating of \"Good\" in the frontal-offset, side impact  and roof strength tests. When the Tundra was first introduced, any model that carried  an engine other than the 5.7-liter V8 was a letdown. However, the midgrade  310-hp 4.6-liter V8 means playing second fiddle isn't necessarily a bad thing.  This engine provides all the muscle most truck buyers need, with better fuel  economy to boot. The base V6 is one of the brawnier base engines in the  segment, but V8 grunt seems like a must in this class. Now, if getting the most  V8 grunt is important, the 5.7 isn't the class leader it once was in terms of  horsepower, but it remains a champ for towing thanks to its axle ratio and a  well-sorted six-speed automatic.\nFor daily use, the 2013 Toyota Tundra's light steering makes  it very easy to drive, though it feels bigger than competing trucks. We were  satisfied with the Tundra's ride quality a few years ago, but the Ford and Ram  trucks have been improved to the point that the Tundra's ride now seems  stiff-legged by comparison. While the interior of  the 2013 Toyota Tundra is fine by pickup truck standards and even has a few  strong points, the fact that it hasn't been updated in five years makes it seem  dated when compared to the more recently redone cabins of its Ford and Ram  competitors. The Platinum model gains upscale touches like perforated leather  upholstery and heated/ventilated front seats, but the fact remains that  designers have done nothing to address more fundamental issues like distantly  placed audio controls, low-quality materials and the base model's  difficult-to-read gauges.\nFrom a practical  standpoint, however, the Tundra scores. Topping the list of thumbs-up inside is  the ridiculously roomy rear seat in CrewMax models, which combines gobs of  legroom with the comfort of reclining seatbacks. Another plus are the  front-hinged rear doors on Double Cab models that make getting in and out of  the adult-friendly backseat much easier than the clamshell-style rear doors on  some competitors. The folding backseats on Double Cab and CrewMax models also  provide a good amount of protected storage for valuable items you'd rather not  leave in the bed. \nStandard equipment on  entry-level Regular Cab models includes 18-inch steel wheels, chrome bumpers,  heated mirrors, full power accessories, a windshield wiper de-icer, a damped  tailgate, cruise control, dual-zone climate control, cloth upholstery, a  40/20/40-split bench seat, a tilt-only steering wheel and a four-speaker sound  system with a CD player and an auxiliary audio jack.\nThe entry-level Double  Cab adds intermittent windshield wipers, keyless entry, an eight-way manually  adjustable driver seat, 60/40-split fold-up rear seats and two extra speakers.  The CrewMax adds a power vertical sliding rear window and a sliding, reclining  and fold-flat rear seat.\nMoving up to the Limited  trim level, which is only offered on Double Cab and CrewMax body styles, gets  you 18-inch alloy wheels, a color-keyed front bumper, foglights, a bed rail  system with adjustable tie-down cleats, power-folding and auto-dimming mirrors,  dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, power front bucket  seats (10-way driver, four-way passenger), heated front seats, a power-operated  sliding rear window (Double Cab), an auto-dimming rearview mirror with built-in  back-up camera display, upgraded gauges and trip computer, a  tilt-and-telescoping leather-wrapped steering wheel, Bluetooth phone and audio  connectivity and a JBL premium audio system with a six-CD changer (10 speakers  in the Double Cab and 12 speakers in the CrewMax).\nThe Platinum trim is only  available with the CrewMax body and adds 20-inch wheels, chrome exterior  treatments, power-folding mirrors that are both heated and auto-dimming, a  sunroof, perforated leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats,  driver seat memory functions and a navigation system with a touchscreen  interface, voice controls and real-time traffic. A rear-seat entertainment  system is available as an option for Platinum and CrewMax Limited models only.\nThere is also a  dizzying array of available option packages, including a Tow package that  bundles a heftier axle ratio, a hitch receiver, a transmission Tow/Haul mode,  oil and transmission fluid coolers, a heavy-duty battery, upgraded alternator  and a seven-pin connector. A Work Truck package strips base Regular and Double  Cab models of convenience features like power mirrors, keyless entry and cruise  control and substitutes black bumpers, vinyl upholstery and heavy-duty rubber  flooring.\nStyling-oriented  packages include a Chrome Appearance package (base Double Cab models only) and  a Sport Appearance package. There are also several off-road-oriented equipment  groups. The TRD Off-Road package adds special 18-inch alloy wheels, off-road  tires, an off-road-tuned suspension, skid plates and tow hooks (the Regular Cab  version also adds many of the convenience niceties found on the other body  styles). The TRD Rock Warrior package (base Double Cab and CrewMax only) is  similar, but includes 17-inch forged alloy wheels and all-terrain tires, along  with a matte black rear bumper and many of the convenience options. Running  boards can be added to all but the Regular Cab Tundra.",

    "full_description": "If you're looking to stop burning fossil  fuels for transportation but you don't find the driving range and recharging  times of battery electric cars to be sufficient, the 2018 Toyota Mirai may be  perfect.  Hydrogen  fuel cell vehicles, such as the Mirai, convert pressurized hydrogen into electricity  that is used to drive an electric motor. Because they are electrically powered,  there are no tailpipe emissions. Yet with its tanks full of hydrogen, the Mirai  can go about 300 miles, which is more than most other similarly priced battery  electric cars, and you can fill it up at a hydrogen refueling station in just a  few minutes. The  main issue is that while you can quickly refuel a Mirai with hydrogen, the lack  of filling stations will curb your desire for one. For 2018, there are just a  handful of stations in California and none in the rest of the country. Also,  with seating for four and no fold-down rear seats, the Mirai might not be the  best for family use. \nWhat's it like to live with?\nTo  learn more about the Toyota Mirai of this generation, read about our  experiences from six months of living with a 2016 Toyota Mirai. We cover everything from seat  comfort to real-world fuel economy, especially important given the Mirai's  hydrogen fuel cell powertrain. Is a fuel cell vehicle worth the expense and  inconvenience? Read through our Toyota Mirai long-term  test to see what we think. If you're looking to stop burning fossil fuels for transportation but you don't find the driving range and recharging times of battery electric cars to be sufficient, the 2018 Toyota Mirai may be perfect. This a hydrogen fuel cell car that drives like an electric, yet you can quickly fill it up with hydrogen just like a gas car. That's assuming, however, there's a filling station close by. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The  ratings in this review are based on our full test of the Toyota Mirai. There is nice pickup off the line due to the electric drivetrain's immediate torque delivery. But it never quite feels quick, as demonstrated by its 8.8-second run from 0 to 60 mph. Chalk it up to a hefty curb weight of 4,097 pounds. We measured a typical-for-an-EV 130-foot 60-0 mph panic stop due to skinny, low-drag tires and the aforementioned weight. The brake pedal feel is quite intuitive in normal driving \u2014 until someone cuts you off and you must act fast, at which point the response gets jumpy. The steering weight feels about right, neither too light nor too heavy. The Mirai generally goes where it's pointed without delay, but it lacks the feedback that lets a driver know exactly how much to turn the wheel to carve the intended path. The Mirai feels coordinated and balanced in daily use, and it is easy to maneuver in tight places. But it begins to feel like a heavy and somewhat narrow car on not-very-grippy tires if you quicken the pace. Better to not be in a big hurry. Direct-drive electric propulsion means acceleration is seamless with zero shifting. It just goes and goes. Not terribly quickly, you understand, but very smoothly. The handsome front seats are nicely sculpted and offer eight-way power adjustments, but the backrest could stand to have more give. The comfy rear seats are individual buckets with a console armrest in between. All four seats have two-stage seat heaters. The Mirai provides a smooth but not plush ride. Drive over some rough pavement, and you'll notice busy body motion now and again. It's generally pleasing, but it could stand a little more polish. The electric motor is very quiet, but the fuel cell and regenerative braking systems do generate occasional odd clicks and keening noises. Tire and wind noise is present in small amounts that will pass unnoticed by most. The touchscreen navigation-audio system is easy to use because of volume and tune knobs, and it responds quickly to touch commands. But its touch-sensitive climate temperature sliders and Prius-like central gauges are questionable. The wide-opening doors are inviting, and it isn't necessary to duck low to climb in up front. The story is much the same for the backseat passengers, but the roof does slope down a little more back there. You'll find ample head- and legroom in the front seats, but the cabin tends to feel a bit narrow at the hip and elbow. Rear legroom is reasonable, but headroom starts to feel tight for those taller than 6 feet, and there are only two rear seats. The slender roof pillars, low door glass and rear three-quarter windows make for good forward and side visibility. A high cowl makes it hard to see the front of the car, but at least front and rear parking sensors and a rearview camera are standard. It's nicely put together, but the interior materials and general fit and finish look like the $32,000 car it would be if it had a gasoline engine, not the $60,000 one it is because of the fuel-cell hybrid electric drivetrain. There is no front center console storage, so you'll need to use the modestly sized glovebox and small front door pockets to store your stuff. There is a rear console box, though. The trunk is moderately sized, but the rear seats do not fold down and there is no pass-through. What you see is all you get. The Mirai comes with driver assist features, a JBL audio system, navigation, and Toyota's own Entune system. This system is Toyota's clunky version of smartphone integration. Toyota made buying the Mirai easy. Aside from six exterior color choices and two interior color options, there are no other options or trims available. It comes pretty well-equipped, though.  All Mirais have keyless ignition and entry, blind-spot monitoring with rear  cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, parking sensors, a navigation  system, premium audio, eight-way power-adjustable, and heated seats and a  heated steering wheel. It's plenty comfortable.The fuel cell electric powertrain  develops 151 horsepower and 247 pound-feet of torque. The EPA gives the Mirai a  66 miles per kilogram of hydrogen (mpkg) estimate. The Honda Clarity Fuel Cell  rates 67 mpkg. Read more about the Mirai's real-world fuel efficiency in our Mirai long-term test.",

    "full_description": "The 2010 Toyota Tacoma is essentially unchanged from last year. The 2010 Toyota Tacoma is a top choice in the midsize pickup segment thanks to a highly capable nature and wide array of configurations. In terms of sheer utility and load-carrying capabilities, a full-size pickup still reigns supreme. But not everybody needs that kind of potential, and given the sacrifices in fuel economy and maneuverability, a full-sizer would seem like a waste for some. For those drivers, plenty of cargo-hauling and off-road ability can be found in the midsize pickup segment.Among this group, you can't do much better than the 2010 Toyota Tacoma. The Tacoma's wide-ranging appeal is due in no small part to its variety of trim levels and body styles. From the base Regular Cab as a work truck to the X-Runner for boulevard cruising and onwards to the trail-taming off-road variants, there is likely a Tacoma to fit your needs. Sturdy construction, a reputation for reliability, a well-appointed cabin and a long list of available features serve to further the Tacoma's attraction.The Toyota Tacoma remains relatively unchanged from last year's model, debunking rumors that 2010 would see an all-new model. Returning in the same fine form is the robust 4.0-liter V6 engine, which is our recommended pick for those who plan on using their Tacomas for towing and heavy hauling duties. For those with less demanding requirements, the smaller, more fuel-efficient four-cylinder will probably suffice.As compact-to-midsize pickups go, we like the 2010 Toyota Tacoma better than other choices like the Chevy Colorado, Dodge Dakota and Ford Ranger. Only the Nissan Frontier and its related twin, the Suzuki Equator, generally match up as equals to the Tacoma in terms of versatility, robustness and all-around performance. As such, you'll want to check out all three trucks. But a Tacoma purchase will certainly get you a well-rounded and highly capable midsize pickup that can take on just about anything you throw at it. The standard engine for 2010 Toyota Tacoma Regular and Access Cabs is a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 159 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque. Rear-wheel-drive models come with the choice of a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission, while four-wheel-drive models are restricted to the manual. Fuel economy for a rear-drive four-cylinder Tacoma with the automatic registers an EPA-estimated 19 mpg city/25 mpg highway and 21 mpg combined, with manual-equipped models gaining 1 mpg across the board. Four-wheel-drive models drop to 17/22/19 mpg.Double Cab and select Access Cab models receive a 4.0-liter V6 that ups output to 236 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual transmission is standard on most V6 Tacomas, and a five-speed automatic is optional (standard on PreRunner Double Cabs). In testing, a Tacoma Double Cab V6 turned-in a 0-60-mph time of 7.8 seconds, which is suitably quick for a midsize truck. Fuel economy for the 4x4 Double Cab with the auto is 16 mpg city/20 mpg highway and 18 mpg combined, while manual-equipped versions make 2 mpg less overall. Access Cab and 4x2 models achieve slightly better mileage. When properly equipped, the Tacoma can tow 6,500 pounds. Standard safety equipment on all 2010 Tacomas includes stability and traction control, antilock brakes (disc front, drum rear) with brake assist, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and front active headrests. Hill-start assist control (HAC) and downhill assist control (DAC) are available on 4WD models equipped with the automatic transmission.In government crash testing, the 2010 Toyota Tacoma received a top five-star rating for its protection of occupants in frontal and side-impact crashes. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Tacoma its top rating of \"Good\" in its frontal-offset and side crash tests. The Tacoma is the only compact/midsize to receive high marks in both tests, earning it the distinction of being an IIHS Top Safety Pick. For drivers who don't plan on heavy hauling, towing or accelerating with any authority, the four-cylinder engine will likely fulfill their needs -- especially as a work truck. The beefier V6 is a much more capable choice for more serious work and play, with plenty of low-range pull that continues into the higher revs. The only downside is that it can get a bit noisy at higher rpm.For better or worse, the 2010 Toyota Tacoma drives like a proper pickup truck. It delivers a reasonably comfortable ride on the streets and, properly equipped, tackles off-road terrain without drama. The Tacoma can, however, feel rather twitchy if the bed's empty and the truck's fitted with one of the stiffer suspensions. It's also worth noting that the brakes ably bring things to a halt, but the soft pedal does not inspire confidence. The Tacoma doesn't break any new ground in terms of interior design, but it is well-built with quality materials and offers plenty of practicality. The attractive metallic interior trim found in higher trim levels adds a bit more refinement, especially when compared to more industrial rivals like the Dodge Dakota. Furthermore, the gimmick-free cockpit benefits from easy-to-read gauges and intuitive controls.Adult passengers will find the Double Cab's rear seats roomy and comfortable, while only smaller folk are likely to find the Access Cab's rear accommodations passable. Some have noted their displeasure with the Tacoma's driving position, feeling that the seat is mounted too low to the floor for a pickup. Behind the cab, a substantial composite inner cargo bed does a good job of defending the surface from dents and rust, and an optional bed-mounted 115-volt/400-watt electrical outlet should be a big hit with campers and tailgaters alike. As the base model, the Tacoma Regular Cabs are lightly equipped, making them ideal as work trucks. Standard features include 15-inch steel wheels, a limited-slip differential, a composite bedliner, a bed utility-rail system, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a cloth front bench seat and a four-speaker stereo with a CD player and an auxiliary audio jack. The Tacoma Access Cab adds air-conditioning, power locks and windows, upgraded cloth upholstery, front bucket seats, a rear bench (includes under-seat storage) and two more speakers. The Tacoma Double Cab adds 16-inch steel wheels, a front skid plate and driver lumbar adjustment.Most options (which can vary by region) are grouped into packages with varying availability depending on body styles and drivetrain choices. The SR-5 package typically combines exterior and interior enhancements that include a chrome grille and rear bumper, foglamps, upgraded seats, keyless entry, a rearview camera, cruise control and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls. The TRD Off-Road package includes 16-inch alloy wheels, fender flares, a heavy-duty suspension, a locking rear differential, skid plates and sport seats. The on-road oriented TRD Sport package includes 17-inch alloy wheels, a hood scoop, a sport suspension and sport seats. Separate options include alloy wheels, cruise control, a towing package, rear park assist, Bluetooth (Double Cab only) and an upgraded stereo with six-CD changer and satellite radio.All Tacoma body styles are available in either two- or four-wheel-drive form. Rear-wheel-drive PreRunner versions adopt the rugged look and suspension of their off-road-focused stablemates, but without the added weight, fuel appetite and traction of actual 4WD. The rear-drive-only X-Runner version is more street performance-oriented, with a body kit, 18-inch alloy wheels, a lowered and sport-tuned suspension, a hood scoop, foglamps and an upgraded stereo.",

    "full_description": "The  2021 C-HR is an extra-small crossover SUV that sits at the bottom of Toyota's  lineup. It serves as an entry-level model akin to the Yaris or the Corolla.  Like everything in this class, the C-HR counts flashy styling as part of its  appeal, though we're split on how well the design works in person.  \nChanges  for 2021 are limited to the addition of more standard driver aids and a new  trim level, though the C-HR had an update in 2020 that brought with it new  front-end styling and more features, including LED headlights and Android Auto  smartphone compatibility. Overall, the C-HR is a decent choice but lags behind  rivals such as the Hyundai Kona, Kia Soul and Mazda CX-30. Learn more about the  C-HR's strengths and weaknesses by reading the categories of our Expert Rating. We  suggest going with the midlevel XLE trim. Compared to the base LE trim, you get keyless entry, blind-spot  monitoring and larger alloy wheels for not much more money. How does the C-HR drive? It's difficult to recommend a vehicle as sluggish as the Toyota C-HR. Its four-cylinder engine simply can't muster enough power to get the C-HR going with any authority. At Edmunds' test track, we logged a 0-60 mph time of 10.6 seconds. That's slower than other small crossovers and hatchbacks. It's even slower than a Toyota Prius. \n\n   But the C-HR holds its own in other categories. The brake pedal is easy to modulate, so it's easy to stop smoothly, and the steering is easy to twirl around at low speeds and accurate in sporty situations. The C-HR is also somewhat entertaining to drive on a twisty road even if there's a distinct lack of grip from the tires. How comfortable is the C-HR? The C-HR's seats are well cushioned and supportive, and the suspension smooths out most bumps in the road. The cabin is a pleasant place to be whether you're a driver or passenger.\n\n   That said, the C-HR isn't built for less than perfect conditions. We noticed that larger patches of rough pavement can easily upset the ride quality and create a lot of noise in the cabin. It isn't very well insulated from outside noise, and any wind gusts stronger than a light breeze are quite loud inside. How\u2019s the interior? Getting in and out of the C-HR is easy thanks to its elevated seating position. There's also plenty of headroom up front. The rear seats have enough room to keep regular-size adults in decent comfort, but the thick rear roof pillars might make them feel a little claustrophobic. \n\n   The C-HR's simple control layout is attractive, and the main controls are easy to operate for the most part. But some of the more advanced features such as the adaptive cruise control are a little more difficult to figure out. It's pretty easy to see out of the front of the C-HR, but those thick rear roof pillars obscure your view to the back. How\u2019s the tech? The C-HR comes with an 8-inch touchscreen that is simple to read and operate through the menus. It connects with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto via smartphones, and an effective navigation system is available. The audio system provides decent clarity, but the sound quality, especially for songs with thumping bass, quickly degrades when the volume rises.\n\n   We're fans of the driver safety aids included in the Toyota Safety Sense 2.5 suite, which is standard on all C-HR models. The lane-keeping alert system can be overzealous in its warnings when you're driving on a twisty road, but it's otherwise helpful. The adaptive cruise control is very good at reducing driver fatigue in heavy traffic and can bring the vehicle down to a smooth stop. How\u2019s the storage? Storage space is tight inside the C-HR. Rear trunk space is about average for the class at 19 cubic feet. You can fold down the rear seats to access 37 cubic feet of capacity, but that figure ranks low compared to the competition. Space for small items is adequate up front, though the center console is only average size. The cupholders are on the small side and awkwardly positioned.\n\n   Planning to put kids in the back? Car seat anchors are positioned well, but there's little room to install a rear-facing child safety seat without moving the front seats forward. Overall the C-HR is compromised by its quirky shape and size, and Toyota did not bring any of its trademark smart storage solutions to the table. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates fuel economy at 29 mpg combined (27 city/31 highway), which is about average for the class. We found the rating accurate, and even exceeded it with an average of 33.9 mpg on our 115-mile mixed-driving evaluation route. Is the C-HR a good value? The C-HR offers solid build quality and distinctive materials for the class. We also like the amount of standard safety equipment Toyota includes and the two years of free scheduled maintenance. But the C-HR isn't as affordably priced as some value-minded competitors. The distinctive styling alone earns Toyota points for bravery. Most people fall into one of two categories: They love the C-HR's design, or they hate it. Those who like it will find the rest of the vehicle filled with personality, from swooping dashboard lines to interesting trapezoid designs pressed into the ceiling. But just about everyone will find that the lack of power can sour the driving experience.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota Corolla gets a slight exterior freshening for 2011 along with a few interior tweaks as well. The number of trim levels has been reduced from five to three; most notably, the sport-tuned XRS trim, with its bigger 2.4-liter four-cylinder, has gotten the axe. The 2011 Toyota Corolla compact sedan rides well and should be reliable, but is otherwise unremarkable in a segment full of more desirable choices.  The Toyota Corolla is the world's best-selling car of all  time. More than 33 million have been sold in the last 35 years, which makes it  mathematically assured that you know someone who either owns one or used to own  one. This car owes much of its success to Toyota's reputation of dependability  and it's hard to argue with such a buying rationale.\nYet once you look beyond that single attribute, you'll discover  that the 2011 Toyota Corolla is no longer the class leader it once was. The  Corolla's fuel economy used to be a benchmark, but now it gets thumped by the  new Hyundai Elantra's EPA-rated 40 mpg highway and 33 mpg combined. Interior  quality is another area in which the Corolla finds itself outclassed. And while  the Corolla has never been described as being fun to drive, the current car  feels so disconnected from the road that you may find yourself thinking you're  playing a very dull video game.\nThe sport-tuned XRS trim, with its more powerful  four-cylinder engine, used to be the model of choice for Corolla buyers seeking  extra responsiveness, but Toyota has killed it for 2011. Also removed from the  Corolla menu this year is the XLE, which was the most luxury-focused trim in  the lineup. On the plus side, the Corolla gains revised styling for 2011,  particularly with the sport-look S trim, which also gets the thick,  flat-bottomed steering wheel found in the new Scion tC.\nIf you think we believe that you can do better than the 2011  Toyota Corolla, you're right. It's not just us, either. Two years ago we  invited six regular Americans to drive the Corolla alongside the 2011 Honda Civic and  previous-generation Mazda 3.  None of our testers put the Corolla in 1st place and all but the most senior members  of the bunch placed it dead last. They echoed our opinion that the Corolla feels  disconnected to drive and expressed disappointment with the look and feel of its  cabin.\nToday the Corolla faces even stiffer competition. Of course,  the Corolla is still known for its reliability, but then so is the Honda Civic,  and Hyundai has improved dramatically in this regard. As such, we highly  recommend shopping around before taking a 2011 Toyota Corolla home. Every 2011 Toyota Corolla is powered by a 1.8-liter inline-4  that produces 132 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed manual  is standard and a four-speed automatic is optional.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, an automatic-equipped Corolla  went from zero to 60 mph in 10.1 seconds -- a slower time for this class.  EPA-estimated fuel economy stands at 26 mpg city/34 mpg highway and 29 mpg  combined with the automatic and 28/35/31 with the manual. These numbers used to  be quite impressive but pale in comparison to the new Hyundai Elantra's promise  of 40 mpg highway. Every Toyota Corolla comes standard with stability and  traction control, antilock brakes with brake assist (front disc, rear drum), front  side airbags and side curtain airbags. In Edmunds brake testing, the Corolla  came to a stop from 60 mph in 127 feet -- an average distance for this type of  car.\nThe Corolla has not been rated using the government's new,  more strenuous 2011 crash testing procedures. Its 2010 ratings (which aren't  comparable to 2011 tests) saw it earning four out of five stars for front  passengers in a frontal crash, and the same for rear passengers in a side  crash. It got five stars for the protection of front passengers in a side  crash. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash testing, the Corolla earned  a perfect \"Good\" rating in the frontal-offset, side and roof strength  tests. The 2011 Toyota Corolla's softly sprung ride is perfect for  commuting, and wind and road noise are nicely quelled, even at highway speeds.  However, handling is unimpressive -- even if you don't profess to be a driving  enthusiast, a back-to-back drive between a Corolla and any number of its  competitors will reveal that the Toyota feels less responsive to inputs and  therefore makes you feel less involved with the driving experience.\nThe Corolla's lone engine choice delivers the sort of  languid acceleration typical at this price point, but Toyota makes a smooth engine, so at least  your ears won't be paying for it. However, given that the car's fuel economy  isn't as impressive as it once was, you may be less willing to put up with such  pokey performance.  The 2011 Corolla's cabin is a bit dull to the eye and the  materials used to construct it are mediocre at best. The cabins of the Chevrolet  Cruze and Ford Focus feel like they belong to a more sophisticated market segment  by comparison. On the upside, the Corolla's controls are quite simple to use,  though opting for the upgraded stereo with iPod and Bluetooth controls makes  things a bit more complicated.\nLike most  Toyotas, the Corolla's seats are soft and comfy, and will likely bring words  like \"recliner\" and \"La-Z-Boy\" to mind. The seats lack  support, however, so some may find long-distance comfort troublesome. The front  seats offer a decent amount of space even for taller drivers (a revelation for  a small Toyota), while the backseat also boasts decent room and a cushy bottom.\nWith 12.3 cubic  feet of space, trunk space is average, but the trunk boasts a usefully wide  opening. \nStandard equipment includes 15-inch steel wheels, power  mirrors, air-conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a  height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split-folding rear seat and a  four-speaker sound system with a CD player and an auxiliary audio jack.\nThe LE adds keyless entry, power locks, power windows  (optional on base), variable intermittent wipers, cruise control and six  speakers. The S adds 16-inch alloy wheels, a sport-look body kit, a rear spoiler,  upgraded cloth upholstery, steering-wheel audio controls and an upgraded trip  computer.\nOptional on the LE and S is a sunroof that includes an  overhead console with map lamps and a sunglasses holder. Also available is an  upgraded six-speaker sound system with satellite radio, an iPod/USB audio  interface and Bluetooth phone and audio player connectivity. The Premium  package available on the LE includes 16-inch alloy wheels, foglamps, the  sunroof and the upgraded audio system.",

    "full_description": "Toyota  redesigned its popular RAV4 just last year. This new model gained a variety of  improvements such as a more powerful engine, more safety features and bolder  styling. These changes have no doubt bolstered the RAV4's popularity, and it  continues to be one of the best-selling vehicles in America. But when we've  compared it to the competition, we've found it falls short of the mark set by  the class leaders. \nCertainly,  it has some appealing qualities. The RAV4 is roomy inside and has plenty of  space for rear passengers and cargo. It also comes standard with an array of  advanced driver safety aids such as forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking. For 2020, Toyota has also added Android Auto smartphone  integration (a boon for Samsung, Pixel and other non-iPhone users) and  introduced a new RAV4 TRD Off-Road model. \nOn  the downside, the RAV4's engine, improved as it may be, is still underwhelming.  It's not especially powerful and gets noisy when you stand on the gas. And  unlike some rival small SUVs, there's no optional engine you can upgrade to if  you want quicker acceleration. We're also disappointed with the lack of comfort  for the RAV4's front seats and the vague steering, which doesn't give you a  good feel for the road. \nGranted,  these aren't huge issues, and the RAV4 is certainly a competent SUV. But we  think you'll find a few other models more appealing overall. These include the  well-rounded Honda CR-V, the sporty Mazda CX-5 and the value-packed Hyundai  Tucson. You should also check out the RAV4 Hybrid, which is both quicker and  more fuel-efficient than the regular RAV4. Finally, the Jeep Cherokee and the  Subaru Forester are worthwhile choices if you're interested in doing some light  off-roading.  There  really seems to be a RAV4 to fit any need and budget, but the XLE Premium trim strikes a good balance  between features and price. Its power liftgate, in particular, is a worthwhile  upgrade. The Adventure and the new TRD Off-Road trims are worthy picks if  you're planning on at least occasional trips on dirt roads and trails. How does the RAV4 drive? The RAV4 doesn't impress here, unfortunately. The engine is willing around town, and passing and merging are drama-free. But if you're in a huge rush, you might notice the engine's ultimately modest power delivery. In Edmunds testing, our RAV4 test vehicle needed 9.1 seconds to cover 0-60 mph, which is slightly slower than the class average.\n\n   Another gripe we have is with the steering, which is vague at the center point and doesn't have appropriate levels of feel and heft. As such, it's easy to misjudge your level of input. In better news, the RAV4's optional upgraded AWD system includes rear-axle torque vectoring and more advanced traction control systems with selectable terrain settings and hill descent control. These systems, plus respectable ground clearance, give the RAV4 Adventure above-average off-road ability for a small SUV. How comfortable is the RAV4? The RAV4's suspension is tuned to strike a good balance between control and softness. The body doesn't bound or float when you drive over bumps, and small to moderate impacts are absorbed without much drama. As for the front seats, they are nicely sculpted and padded appropriately, but the seat bottoms begin to feel flat on longer drives. The passenger side's lack of adjustment can also make it difficult to find a comfortable position.\n\n   At highway speeds, the RAV4 is generally quiet. The exception is when you hit the gas for a burst of speed, at which point the engine sound gets rather coarse. We do like the climate system's performance. Air distribution is ideal, with forward vents that can be closed off completely and vents for the rear seat. How\u2019s the interior? The driving position, roominess, and ease of entry and exit are all good. But the RAV4 would score higher if the front passenger seat wasn't set so high or could be adjusted down. The driver's seat and steering wheel have a good range of adjustment, but tall drivers might want a smidge more of each. Outward visibility is praiseworthy.\n\n   The control layout is intuitive with large, easy-to-read labeling. The audio system and climate system controls are islands unto themselves, and everything else is right where you expect it to be. The big rubberized climate control knobs are nice too. Our only gripe is that the touchscreen is too far away from the driver. The tuning knob, in particular, requires a reach to twist. How\u2019s the tech? The RAV4's interface has a mix of touchscreen and fixed buttons that are easy to learn without consulting the owner's manual. But even though the RAV4 is relatively new, the touchscreen's graphics look dated. The sound system works well enough, but it's nothing special. You do get standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto this year. It's a good thing too since Toyota's native Entune software remains clunky.\n\n   The standard suite of driver aids is impressive. It includes adaptive cruise control that works down to 0 mph, automatic emergency braking, drowsy driver detection, automatic high beams, lane keeping assist, and something called Line Tracing Assist, which is an active (but not hands-free) steering aid. How\u2019s the storage? The RAV4's cargo hold is nearly the biggest in its class. You get 37.5 cubic feet with the rear seats up and 69.8 cubic feet with them stowed. The RAV4 is also easy to load thanks to a low cargo floor. Up front, the cabin has numerous shelves and bins to handle assorted road-trip paraphernalia. If you're planning on towing, certain versions of the RAV4 can pull up to 3,500 pounds, which is above average for a small SUV.\n\n   Parents with young kids will appreciate the RAV4. It's easy to locate and connect safety seats to the lower car seat anchors. Likewise, tethering to the three upper anchors is straightforward. Forward-facing seats and boosters fit readily, but installing a rear-facing infant seat on the passenger side will likely require scooting the front seat up. The too-high front passenger seat is the issue. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates the RAV4 will get 27-30 mpg in combined city/highway driving, depending on the powertrain and trim level. We drove an AWD Adventure carrying three people, equipment and luggage for more than 7,000 miles. And over a variety of road and weather conditions, we averaged 28.6 mpg. Our best tank was 32.3 mpg and the worst was 25.6 mpg. Is the RAV4 a good value? The RAV4 is well built inside, with nice layered materials and seams that are invisible because they're built into the styling. It has tactile touches such as rubberized grip surfaces on the interior door pulls and the radio and climate knobs. The RAV4's optional simulated leather upholstery feels soft and pliable, and the stitching is tidy. Toyota's warranty coverage is average, but you do get a generous two years/25,000 miles of free scheduled maintenance. Driving a RAV4 isn't a chore, but it's not particularly memorable either. It's at its best when you go with the Adventure or TRD Off-Road trim level. The advanced torque vectoring all-wheel-drive system, capable traction control system with multiple terrain settings, and styling that's a little more rugged help the RAV4 stand out a little more.",

    "full_description": "The 2006 Toyota Prius gets a tire-pressure monitor this year, along with an optional backup camera. Exterior styling is refreshed with new headlights and taillight clusters, while the interior receives darker seat fabric and a textured instrument panel center. Leather seating with a leather-wrapped steering wheel and an audio mini-jack port are newly optional. The 2006 Toyota Prius is a full-featured midsize family car that just so happens to be the most fuel-efficient sedan on the market. The fact that it starts at about $21K makes it all the more attractive. The Toyota Prius wasn't the first hybrid car on the market in the U.S., but with four doors, a sizable trunk and room for four, it was the first such vehicle to offer the practicality of a typical economy car along with the outstanding fuel mileage of a hybrid. The second-generation model, introduced in 2004, delivers all that and more, with an even larger interior, hatchback utility and a hybrid drivetrain that's more powerful and cleaner than the previous version.For the uninitiated, a hybrid drivetrain typically uses a small gasoline engine in conjunction with an electric motor to provide power while keeping emissions and fuel usage to a minimum. Under full acceleration, both power sources work together to provide maximum oomph, but under lighter load conditions, such as stop-and-go traffic, the Toyota Prius alternates between the two, oftentimes running purely on battery power alone. A regenerative braking system converts energy normally lost as heat into electricity to charge the car's batteries. Although the current powertrain works in much the same way as the first-generation model, it delivers considerably more power with fewer emissions. Toyota claims that its exhaust emissions have been reduced by 30 percent over the previous model, allowing it to earn both SULEV (Super Ultra Low-Emission Vehicle) and PZEV (Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle) ratings. Although the Toyota car is rated to get combined city/highway mileage of 55 miles to the gallon by the EPA, our experience has shown that its real-world mileage is about 45 mpg.Apart from its high-tech drivetrain, the 2006 Toyota Prius offers comfortable accommodations for four adults. It's a little smaller than most midsize sedans, but even tall passengers have enough room in the rear seats. Top-notch interior materials and a unique design give the cabin an alternative look and feel, but all the amenities you would expect are there. The Prius features an innovative automatic climate control system that runs entirely on electricity. This means the A/C will continue to cool even when the gas engine is not running, such as at a stoplight. It also features a humidity sensor and smart programming so the A/C compressor runs only when it is necessary. The benefit is that you can leave it in auto-mode year round without worry of wasting any energy. The Prius' hatchback design makes loading larger items into the cargo area a snap, and with 16.1 cubic feet of space, there's nearly as much room in the trunk as in a Camry.The Prius hybrid is a legitimate family sedan that offers everything you would expect from a Toyota car -- like solid build quality and refinement -- and a few things you don't -- like a low base price. Add in the eye-popping mileage and long list of standard features, and it's easy to see why the 2006 Toyota Prius remains one of the most talked about cars available today. There is only one engine and transmission combination available. The \"Hybrid Synergy Drive\" power plant consists of a 1.5-liter gasoline engine and two electric drive motor/generators. The gas engine produces 76 horsepower and 82 pound-feet of torque, while the electric motors generate the equivalent of 67 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. Net horsepower is 110, mainly because the two power sources hit their peak at different times. Regardless, power delivery is smooth and consistent from rest all the way to top speed. The Toyota Prius features an elegantly simple continuously variable \"transmission\" of sorts, called a power split device. It provides the ease of a conventional automatic transmission, but there are no gears to shift, drive belts, torque converter or clutch. The motors work in concert with the gas engine, through a planetary gearset, to provide seamless power and maximum efficiency at all times. Fuel mileage is rated at 60 city and 51 highway, though real-world mileage is typically in the mid 40s. All 2006 Toyota Prius models come standard with four-wheel antilock brakes with BrakeAssist and traction control. Electronic stability control and side-impact/side curtain airbags are optional. Government crash tests on the Toyota car resulted in a four-star (out of five) rating for everything but the driver in the frontal-impact test, which earned five stars. In IIHS testing, the Prius earned a top score of \"Good\" for its protection of occupants in frontal and side-impact crashes. As you'd expect, the Toyota Prius is no speed demon (zero to 60 mph in about 10.4 seconds), but when it comes to the kind of daily driving that most drivers encounter, there's more than enough power to get around. The continuously variable transmission (CVT) takes some getting used to since it doesn't shift gears, but it does make the best use of the hybrid drivetrain's power. Cabin noise is minimal, and the suspension is comfortably soft without feeling too floaty. Materials quality is impressive, and the overall look is upscale. The gauge cluster is positioned toward the center of the dashboard, but the display is clear and easy to see. The optional touchscreen DVD-based navigation system features a backup camera display and can be voice-operated. The 2006 Toyota Prius hybrid is available as a four-door hatchback only, in one well-appointed trim level. The standard features list includes power windows, locks and mirrors; automatic climate control; a tilt steering wheel with audio and climate controls; a six-speaker CD stereo; cruise control; trip computer; and 15-inch aluminum wheels. Options like a DVD-based navigation system, Bluetooth hands-free phone technology and a nine-speaker JBL premium audio system with a six-disc CD changer are also available, along with leather seating and xenon headlights. The available Smart Key system allows you to lock/unlock the doors and start the car with the key safely in your pocket or purse. The optional voice command system permits voice control of features ranging from temperature adjustment to Bluetooth cell phone dialing.",

    "full_description": "Toyota's popular and off-road-ready SUV carries over to the 2007 model year with no significant changes. A multipurpose midsize SUV that does just about everything well, the 2007 Toyota 4Runner has long been one of our favorites. Now in its fourth generation, the Toyota 4Runner is largely unchanged for 2007. It still has the expected rugged good looks and true off-road capability of a stout, no-nonsense sport-utility vehicle. While other SUVs in its class have evolved into softer, kinder, gentler versions of their originals, the 4Runner has retained much of its truckish character. This might seem like a misguided philosophy when you consider that few SUV owners actually go off-road, but Toyota looks at the situation a bit differently. It sees the 4Runner's all-terrain capability as a selling point over its rivals. If you want a \"soft roader,\" there are plenty to choose from -- Toyota's own Highlander is a perfect example and the Honda Pilot and Mitsubishi Endeavor are also good choices. But if you want a genuine sport-utility vehicle that actually goes off-road, the Toyota 4Runner is still the real deal.This body-on-frame SUV has two available engines: a 4.0-liter V6 or a 4.7-liter V8. There's a decent amount of cargo room with a maximum capacity of 75 cubic feet, but the Toyota 4Runner still lags behind the competition in this regard. Toyota isn't completely oblivious to this fact, as the company offers a foldable cargo shelf that allows for two-tiered loading. Those hoping for a third-row seat are in luck, as it's optional, but the bad news is that it doesn't fold flat into the floor like other midsize SUVs.Overall, the 2007 Toyota 4Runner stacks up favorably against just about any other midsize sport-ute on the market when it comes to creature comforts and standard equipment. Add in the powerful engines, advanced vehicle control systems and stout underpinnings, and there's little doubt this Toyota SUV upholds the legacy of the numerous 4Runners before it. It's great off-road, comfortable on-road and will suit most families with its adequate cargo-hauling capacity. The Toyota 4Runner is available with rear- or four-wheel drive and one of two engines. The standard 4.0-liter V6 makes 236 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque. The optional 4.7-liter V8 generates 260 hp and 306 lb-ft of torque. All 4Runners get a five-speed automatic transmission. Towing capacity is 7,300 pounds on V8 models, while V6 models top out at 5,000 pounds. All Toyota 4Runner models come with antilock disc brakes and stability control (called VSC). The 4WD versions also come with hill-start assist and downhill assist. Optional on all models are front-seat side airbags and side curtain airbags for first- and second-row passengers. In NHTSA crash testing, the 2007 Toyota 4Runner earned four out of five stars in the frontal-impact category and a perfect five stars for side impacts. In IIHS frontal-offset testing, the 4Runner received a \"Good\" rating, the highest. Both engines move the 4Runner out quickly. Although the V8 is a must if you plan on doing any serious towing, most buyers will be happy with the less expensive and more fuel-efficient V6. When driven on pavement, the 2007 Toyota 4Runner delivers a smooth, controlled ride, and handling around turns is surprisingly tight and responsive for a traditional body-on-frame sport-ute. Models with the X-REAS system have their dampers diagonally linked. (The front left damper, or shock, is linked to the rear right and the front right is linked to the rear left.) The system helps improve on-road handling and dampens body roll and pitch. Taken off-road, this Toyota SUV is right at home, tackling steep passes with little drama and delivering an almost luxurious ride even on rutted trails. The Toyota 4Runner offers roomy quarters for four to five passengers and maybe a few kids if you opt for the 50/50 third-row seat. To make way for cargo, each half of the third-row seat can be stowed in an upright position along the sideboards or removed completely, but it does not fold flat into the floor. The overall design of the interior is both aesthetically pleasing and seriously functional, with most controls easy to find and use. Our only major ergonomic complaint concerns the climate controls, which look like intuitive dials but work more like joysticks. Maximum cargo capacity is 75 cubic feet, which trails behind most of the 4Runner's midsize competitors. The 2007 Toyota 4Runner is a midsize SUV. It comes in three trim levels: SR5, Sport and Limited. Standard features on the base SR5 include 16-inch wheels, automatic climate control with rear vents, a CD/MP3 player with an auxiliary input jack, remote keyless entry, cruise control, a trip computer and full power accessories. Stepping up to the Sport Edition adds larger 17-inch wheels, \"X-REAS\" shock absorbers, color-keyed exterior mirrors, power front seats, special seat fabric and a telescoping leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls. High-dollar Limited models pick up illuminated running boards, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 115-volt power outlet, leather upholstery and heated front seats. Options include a navigation system, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, a premium JBL audio system and a third-row seat. The X-REAS shocks are optional for the Limited and come with a height-adjustable rear air suspension.",

    "full_description": "For 2011, the Toyota Sequoia carries through essentially unchanged. With class-leading refinement, versatility and user-friendly features, the 2011 Toyota Sequoia is one of the top picks among full-size SUVs. The 2011 Toyota Sequoia marks the 10th year of production  for this perennial overachiever. Ever since its last redesign three years ago,  the Sequoia's generous helpings of torque, interior volume and civilized road  manners have kept it a top choice among full-size SUVs.\nThanks to its available 5.7-liter V8, the 2011 Sequoia is  one of the quickest SUVs in its class. In our testing, a Sequoia Limited 4WD  hustled its nearly 6,000-pound frame to 60 mph in 6.7 seconds. There's plenty  of towing capacity, too, with up to 7,400 pounds available when properly  equipped. Its 4.6-liter base V8, introduced last year and standard on the SR5,  is no slouch either, with its 310 horsepower and 327 pound-feet of torque. \nThe Sequoia's chassis balances a comfortable highway ride  with adequate off-road agility. An independent rear suspension, a relatively  tight 39-foot turning circle and 10 inches of ground clearance make the Sequoia  at home on trails, in the Costco parking lot and on the urban expressway. A  rear air suspension is also available on the Platinum model.\nGrowing families will also appreciate the Sequoia's  versatile second-row seats, available as either a 40/20/40-split bench or  captain's chairs. These seats feature plenty of fore-aft adjustment, optimizing  legroom or cargo room as needs dictate. Unlike GM's full-size SUVs, the  Sequoia's independent rear suspension allows the roomy 60/40-split third-row  seat to fold flat. Stowing the second- and third-row seats opens up a cavernous  121 cubic feet of cargo space for more serious hauling, facilitated by a power  liftgate that is now standard on the Limited.\nIf you're not in need of the Sequoia's massive towing and  hauling abilities, however, a large crossover SUV like the 2011 GMC Acadia (or its  Buick Enclave/Chevy Traverse relatives), 2011 Ford Flex or 2011 Mazda CX-9 would be a  better choice. These crossovers offer competitive passenger and cargo space  with lower price tags, better handling and superior fuel economy. The 2011  Infiniti QX56 is a very appealing new entry among Herculean full-size SUVs, yet  the 2011 Toyota Sequoia still is among the best in its class. The standard engine for the 2011 Sequoia SR5 is a 4.6-liter V8 that makes 310 hp and 327 lb-ft of torque. Limited and Platinum models come with a 5.7-liter V8 (optional on the SR5) that produces 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque. In Edmunds testing, a Sequoia with the 5.7-liter V8 went from zero to 60 mph in a quick 6.7 seconds. Properly equipped, a 5.7-liter Sequoia can tow up to 7,400 pounds.\nBoth engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Four-wheel-drive models feature a two-speed transfer case with electronic shifting and push-button locking. EPA estimated fuel economy for the 4.6-liter V8 is 14 mpg city/20 mpg highway and 16 mpg combined. The 5.7-liter V8 drops slightly to 14/18/15 mpg. Four-wheel-drive models attain about 1 mpg less. Standard safety equipment for all 2011 Toyota Sequoias includes antilock disc brakes, stability control, front-seat side airbags, front knee airbags and three-row side curtain airbags. Front and rear parking sensors are standard on the Sequoia Platinum and Limited, as is a back-up camera (optional on the SR5).\nIn Edmunds recent brake testing, the Toyota Sequoia required 127 feet to come to a stop from 60 mph, which is short for SUVs in this class. For a large SUV, the 2011 Toyota Sequoia's pleasant driving experience will likely win you over. The 5.7-liter V8's abundance of low-end torque makes passing maneuvers effortless, and the six-speed automatic is always on point with gear selection, even when towing. Even the 4.6-liter V8 pulls hard, particularly if you won't be maxing out your SUV's payload and towing capacities on a regular basis.\nRide comfort ranges from smooth and composed in an SR5 to downright plush in a Sequoia Platinum with the adaptive dampers. Around corners, the suspension does a fine job of managing 3 tons of SUV, though the numb steering adds to the overall sense of heft. Aside from audio and navigation controls that are hard to reach, the Sequoia's interior is a triumph of ergonomics, with plenty of storage bins and family-friendly conveniences.\nThe second-row seats adjust fore and aft regardless of whether the 40/20/40-split bench or the captain's chairs are specified. In addition, the bench seat's center \"20\" section slides farther forward, which can be useful if a child safety seat is installed. There's also a conversation mirror so you can quell potential uprisings in the rear quarters.\nThe 60/40 third-row seat in Limited and Platinum models has both a power-recline and a power-fold feature. With both sets of rear seats folded down, the Sequoia's cargo space tops out at 121 cubic feet. \nThe Limited adds 20-inch wheels, a power liftgate, leather upholstery, upgraded instrumentation, a back-up camera integrated into the rearview mirror and an upgraded 14-speaker JBL sound system with a six-CD changer.\nThe top-of-the-line Sequoia Platinum adds load-leveling rear air springs, adaptive shock absorbers, heated and cooled front seats, heated second-row captain's chairs (dropping capacity to seven), power-folding and -reclining rear seats, and a touchscreen navigation system.\nToyota offers two option packages for the SR5. The Sport Appearance package is a seven-passenger configuration that includes 20-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, foglights and a power driver seat. The Premium package seats eight and adds leather upholstery, heated driver and front passenger seats, a power fold-and-recline third row and a back-up camera integrated into the rearview mirror. Sequoia Limited options include a rear-seat entertainment system, navigation system and second-row captain's chairs.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota RAV4 is fully redesigned for 2013. The long-awaited redesign of the Toyota RAV4 is well executed, as this compact crossover SUV now has the performance, features and cabin accommodations to keep up with the leaders in this class. Although it's still not a standout in any one area, Toyota's entry is worth a look. In just half a decade, crossover SUVs have become the go-to choice  among car buyers. It's no accident; the full-size SUV craze of the late '90s  and early 2000s addicted most American drivers to cavernous cargo spaces,  elevated driving positions and eye-watering gasoline bills. The Toyota RAV4 was  among the first models to downsize that addiction into a manageable package.\nWith the redesigned 2013 Toyota RAV4, the fourth generation  of the popular crossover, the automaker has given and also taken away. Notably,  the RAV4 no longer offers an optional V6. Although the burly six-cylinder could  catapult the mild grocery getter to 60 mph in quick fashion, Toyota reports  that the vast majority of buyers didn't want to pay the premium for it and  stuck with the base four-cylinder engine. For 2013, the RAV4 comes with a  four-cylinder only. Toyota's compact crossover also dispenses with a third-row  seat, another option that the automaker says few shoppers deemed important.\nThe 2013 Toyota RAV4 does, however, get a six-speed  transmission to replace the old four-speed automatic. It improves fuel economy  and makes the crossover more responsive during merging and passing maneuvers.\nFurther, the RAV's styling is more sculpted and aggressive  this year. Its physical dimensions have barely changed, though, as the old RAV4  already had plenty of interior room. One major upgrade is the debut of a  roof-hinged liftgate, which replaces the old side-hinged gate that swung out to  the right and hindered curbside loading. Even better, the spare tire is now  housed under the cargo floor, rather than on the tailgate, so the latter isn't  as heavy as in years past.\nCompact crossover SUVs are quickly replacing midsize sedans  as the family car of choice, so this redesign of the 2013 Toyota RAV4 could not  have come soon enough. The small crossover class is full of interesting  choices, including the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Hyundai  Santa Fe Sport and Mazda  CX-5. Compared to these models, the RAV4 strikes us as middle-of-the road: It  has no major faults but also doesn't stand out for its style, performance or  interior accommodations. But with its ample cargo capacity, improved fuel  economy and agreeable ride quality, the new RAV4 is definitely one to try. The 2013 Toyota RAV4 is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder  that produces 176 horsepower and 172 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed  automatic is standard, and the RAV4 is available with either front- or  all-wheel drive.\nIn Edmunds testing, an  all-wheel-drive Toyota RAV4 needed 9.1 seconds to hit 60 mph, an average time  for this segment. The front-drive RAV4 returns an EPA-estimated 24 mpg  city/31 mpg highway/26 combined, which is very good for a small crossover. The  all-wheel-drive model, meanwhile, achieves 22 mpg city/29 mpg highway and 25  mpg combined. Antilock disc brakes, stability control, traction control,  whiplash-reducing front head restraints, front-seat side airbags and  full-length side curtain airbags come standard on every 2013 Toyota RAV4. A  driver knee airbag is also standard. Blind-spot detection and rear  cross-traffic alert systems are optional on the Limited trim.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the RAV4 stopped from 60 mph in  127 feet, which is just a tad longer than average. Regarding Insurance  Institute For Highway Safety crash tests, the new RAV4 earned a top score of  \"Good\" for its protection of occupants in moderate-overlap frontal-offset,  side-impact and roof strength tests. The RAV earned a Poor rating (the lowest)  in the agency's new small-overlap frontal-offset crash test (in which a smaller  portion of the vehicle's front bumper strikes a barrier). Several competing  small SUVs also received a low rating in this test. The government gave the  Toyota four out of five stars for overall protection, with four stars for total  frontal protection and five stars for total side crash protection. Although we miss the old RAV4's V6, the 2.5-liter four-cylinder  is adequately powerful for most tasks and returns good fuel economy for this  class. The new six-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly, but if you  tend to drive assertively, you'll find it slow to downshift in passing  situations. Additionally, when climbing steady mountain grades, we've observed  that the transmission has a tendency to hunt between gears (rather than picking  one gear and sticking with it). Both of these issues are a consequence of  Toyota's efforts to tune the drivetrain for maximum gas mileage.\nThe 2013 Toyota RAV4 handles better than before and feels  more substantial, refined and comfortable when cruising down the highway. A  potential exception is the Limited model, which can get jittery on rough or  broken pavement due to its big 18-inch wheels. In spite of that, the cabin  remains very quiet, making Toyota's crossover a good option for families with  young children who sleep in the car.\nMore demanding drivers will likely find the 2013 RAV4 less enjoyable  to drive than the Ford Escape or Mazda CX-5. It lacks the responsive steering  and sure-footed suspension tuning that make those models feel decidedly more  carlike. Should you need to venture off the beaten path, however, the Toyota  RAV4's available all-wheel-drive system quickly applies power where it's needed  for optimum traction and actually gives it a decent amount of off-road ability. The 2013 Toyota RAV4 features a new interior design that  shares motifs with the current Camry and Avalon. Pronounced angles and lines  form a more streamlined and modern-looking dash. Quality has improved, too, and  some of the materials are nicer than what you'll find in the Camry. Overall,  though, the RAV's design and materials are average for the compact crossover  class. The cupholder count is adequate in the Toyota RAV4, but there aren't as  many useful storage slots as in the CR-V.\nThe RAV4's optional navigation  system includes Entune, a suite of smartphone-connected services that includes  the Bing search engine, Pandora streaming radio and real-time traffic, sports  and stock information. Getting started with Entune can be a hassle, though,  since you have to install an app on your phone and register for an account,  plus you always need an active data connection to use it. The touchscreen  interface has straightforward menus, but it's sometimes unresponsive to user  touch. On the upside, all the conventional controls in the 2013 RAV4 are easy  to use.\nRear-seat passenger comfort in the 2013 Toyota RAV4 is  hampered slightly by a low-mounted backseat, but space is nevertheless abundant  enough for even taller adults. We also like how the seat reclines to an impressive  degree.\nThe cargo bay measures 38.4 cubic feet and opens up to a  generous 73.3 cubes when the second row is folded: one of the largest  capacities in the class. There's also a payoff for that low-mounted rear seat: a  very flat floor and low load-in height, both of which help minimize the strain  of loading large items or even a couple of large dogs. The RAV4 finally gains a  roof-hinged liftgate for 2014; it's power-operated and height-adjustable on the  Limited. \nThe XLE adds 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, heated side  mirrors, roof rails, a sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate control and  sportier front seats. An optional package further adds a navigation system,  Toyota's Entune smartphone integration system, satellite radio, HD radio and  voice controls.\nThe top-level Limited comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, a  height-adjustable power liftgate, keyless entry/ignition, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, an eight-way  power-adjustable driver seat with memory settings, heated front seats and  premium synthetic leather upholstery. The navigation system with Entune is  available and can be bundled with a premium 11-speaker JBL audio system.",

For 2021, the Camry gets some minor  styling updates inside and out. Toyota has restyled the front bumper and  grille, and there's a newly optional 9-inch touchscreen display that's  positioned higher on the dash than the standard 7-inch screen. We're pleased  with the changes, though they're ultimately not quite enough to elevate the  Camry past higher-ranked sedans such as the Kia K5, Honda Accord and Mazda 6.  Check our Expert Rating for our in-depth take on the 2021 Camry.What's it like to live with?We bought a 2018 Camry in the sporty SE  trim and tested it for more than a year. To learn what it was like to live  with, read our long-term test,  where we covered everything from seat comfort to fuel economy. Note that the  2021 Camry differs slightly from that 2018 model, which did not have Apple  CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration, but our coverage is otherwise  applicable.  There's no shortage of Camrys to choose from. We suggest going with the XSE because of its wealth of standard features, attractive styling touches and its sport-tuned (yet still comfortable) suspension. Opting for the XSE gets you desirable equipment such as standard blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and leather upholstery. It also opens up nice-to-have options including a panoramic sunroof and heated seats. How does the Camry drive? We tested the four-cylinder Camry SE. Toyota has optimized it to get high fuel economy, but the trade-off is rather sluggish acceleration off the line. Our test car accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in an unimpressive 8.2 seconds, though it feels a little zestier than that in the real world. The transmission helps make up for this a bit with reasonably good response and quick shifting. With eight speeds, there's always a gear for the occasion, but expect two-gear downshifts when you dip into gas as it tries to make do with available engine power.    The Camry SE benefits from a slightly sportier suspension, which lends a more hunkered-down feel. It's not set up for truly aggressive driving, but it'll handle anything the average driver is bound to throw at it on a daily basis. The brakes are also easy to control with a light and responsive pedal, and the Camry's stopping performance is about average for the segment. How comfortable is the Camry? Big, comfortable seats and a smooth ride mean the Camry will suit a wide range of drivers even on long trips. Add in a powerful, easy-to-use climate control system that can cool the cabin effectively, even in triple-digit temperatures, and the Camry provides a pleasant cabin environment for any occupant along for the ride.     Its biggest flaw here is that the Camry lets in too much outside noise. You'll hear a prominent engine buzz when accelerating and noticeable wind and road noise at freeway speeds. The Camry is definitely noisier than average for a midsize sedan. How\u2019s the interior? The Camry's cabin won't wow you with its opulence but instead nails the fundamentals across the board. Highlights include an airy cabin that is easy to get in and out of. It's also spacious for both front and rear occupants and has great outward visibility. An optional 360-degree camera system makes it even easier to navigate cramped parking lots.    The user interface presents no mysteries, with large, clear gauges and simple, well-labeled buttons. They are relatively intuitive even for tech-averse drivers. The radio volume and tuning knobs are small but easy for the driver to reach, though the passenger might have to stretch a bit to use them. How\u2019s the tech? The Camry's smartphone integration includes standard Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa. Both the standard 7-inch and optional 9-inch infotainment touchscreens are easy to read and operate. Built-in navigation is offered on higher trims if you want it. Three USB ports and the option to add a wireless charger should provide plenty of charge for all occupants on the road.    All 2021 Camrys come with Toyota's Safety Sense 2.5+. It's an impressive suite of standard driver assistance features such as adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking and lane keeping assist. Previously, some of these systems have been too sensitive for our liking, but they've been refined for 2021 and work much better. How\u2019s the storage? As midsize sedans go, the Camry's stuff-hauling credentials are pretty solid. The 15.1-cubic-foot trunk area is large for the class. It also has a wide opening with a low liftover height. The 60/40-split back seat is easy to fold down via trunk-mounted release handles if you need to fit longer items.     There is a good amount of concealed cabin storage too. There's a sliding compartment underneath the wireless charger, a moderately sized center armrest bin, and a small storage cubby on the far left-hand side of the dash. Camry buyers with kids will appreciate the ample rear-seat room for car seat access and the easily accessible anchors. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The four-cylinder Camry SE's EPA fuel economy rating is among the best in its class at 32 mpg combined (28 city/39 highway). We measured 33.7 mpg on our standardized 115-mile evaluation drive route that provides a mix of city and highway driving. Edmunds also tested a Camry SE of this generation for more than 33,000 miles and observed an average of 29.8 mpg. Is the Camry a good value? The Camry is an easy-to-use, dependable and fuel-efficient vehicle at the expense of some excitement. It isn't as feature-driven as the Hyundai Sonata or as luxurious as the Mazda 6, but its design and variety of textures manage to be attractive without sacrificing functionality.    Toyota's warranties and after-care support are pretty typical, with a three-year/36,000-mile basic and five-year/60,000-mile powertrain coverage. That's nowhere near what Hyundai and Kia offer, but most other brands are in the same boat. The Camry doesn't disappoint, especially in SE trim. It won't replace a real sport sedan, but its pleasing driving dynamics are certainly welcome in this class of car. And with relatively aggressive styling, the Camry at least tries to shrug off the image that midsize sedans don't have to be boring.",

    "full_description": "The 2018 Toyota Highlander is one  of the best picks available for a versatile three-row crossover SUV. Thanks to  a comfortable and quiet ride, abundant standard features and a just-right size,  it should serve you well as a do-all family hauler.   While  the Highlander isn't as big as traditional truck-based SUVs such as Toyota's  Sequoia, it's easier to maneuver around town, yet it still has three relatively  usable rows of seating. It also delivers above-average fuel economy for a three-row  SUV. The third row is a bit tighter than we'd like, but kids will fit just fine  back there. We also like how Toyota outfits every Highlander with its Toyota  Safety Sense bundle, which include adaptive cruise control, lane departure  intervention, and forward collision mitigation with automatic emergency  braking.  If  you need a crossover with a roomier third row, you'll probably be happier with  a Honda Pilot or Volkswagen Atlas. Toyota's also a bit behind the times in  smartphone connectivity &mdash; you can't get Android Auto or Apple CarPlay  on the Highlander. Overall, though, this popular and well-rounded crossover is  certainly worth a test drive.  Notably,  we picked the 2018 Highlander as one of Edmunds' Best Midsize SUVs for 2018. The 2018 Toyota Highlander is one of the best picks available for a versatile three-row crossover SUV. Thanks to a comfortable and quiet ride, abundant standard features and a just-right size, it should serve you well as a do-all family hauler. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2014 Toyota Highlander XLE (3.5L V6 |  6-speed automatic | AWD). NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Highlander has received some  revisions, including a new V6 engine with an eight-speed automatic transmission  and additional feature content. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this  year's Highlander. The Highlander's V6 provided impressive acceleration in 2014, and the latest V6 (updated for 2017) only improves upon that capability. The new eight-speed automatic shifts smoothly and is reasonably responsive. Despite a vague-feeling pedal, the Highlander provides substantial braking effectiveness \u2014 the panic-stop distance from 60 mph in Edmunds testing ranks among the class best \u2014 and very good fade resistance. About as good as it gets for a large SUV. It has intuitive response and reassuring feedback when cornering and isolated straight-line stability on the highway. And the Highlander is a cinch to park. A confident and competent handler, right up to the relatively low limit set by the stability control system, which really lets you know when you're asking too much. The new SE model's sport-tuned suspension provides a firmer ride but only minor handling improvements. The Highlander feels bigger than some competitors when you're behind the wheel, so tighter parking maneuvers might feel hairy. It has nice-and-easy steering for parking lots, though, and indeed it is a very easy SUV to drive in general. There's no low-range gearing, but a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system, 8 inches of ground clearance, hill hold and hill descent control, and advantageous approach and departure angles give the Highlander admirable off-road capabilities for a family hauler. Heated leather front seats are as comfy as furniture and offer tons of adjustment, including extendable thigh support. The second-row seats are firmer, but they slide and recline in a wide range. The third row is merely acceptable; certain competitors do better. One of the Highlander's best qualities is its ride comfort. This crossover is highly isolated and confident without feeling like a floating barge. Few if any road irregularities intrude. One of the quietest SUVs we've ever measured. Only an occasional wisp of wind noise is evident on a gusty highway pass. Some controls, specifically those for the audio system, are located too far away. Otherwise, Toyota's typical array of controls is easy to use. It can be difficult to reach the third row since the second row (be it captain's chairs or the bench) doesn't provide a wide path to the way back. But the doors are large, and the seats are of a reasonable height. Abundant seat adjustments, including power-adjustable thigh support (a rare feature) on most trim levels. Sufficient seat and telescoping-wheel travel for taller drivers. As is true of most competitors, the first and second rows provide copious room for adult occupants. The third row is squishier than that of the Honda Pilot, and despite having three seat belts, only small kids are likely to fit three abreast back there. The quality of materials is high, and during our one-year long-term test of a Highlander, everything in the cabin remained nicely screwed together. Impressive. There's a unique built-in shelf on the dashboard that serves as a resting place for phones or other personal items. A vast amount of space is found under the sliding armrest cover \u2014 it's big enough to store a laptop or a sizable purse. The Highlander offers an average amount of cargo capacity for the segment, regardless of how many rows are in place. Some others offer more space behind the third row, notably the Ford Explorer. A properly equipped Highlander V6 can tow up to 5,000 pounds, which is essentially the standard for the segment. To beat that, you'll need a more rugged alternative such as the Dodge Durango. Toyota's touchscreen interfaces aren't the flashiest or most feature-packed, but they are easy to use. The 8-inch version (standard on most models) is notably quick to respond to inputs and features large, easily pressed icons. Every Highlander comes standard with forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, along with adaptive cruise control and lane departure intervention. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are included on the XLE on up. For the typical Highlander  shopper, we recommend the XLE trim  level. Priced right in the middle of the Highlander range, the XLE comes  standard with the V6 and adds several decent extras to the Highlander's already  rich list of standard features, including blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert systems, leather upholstery, heated front seats, and  keyless ignition and entry. There's also optional all-wheel drive if you need  the extra control. You could certainly get by with the LE Plus or pay more to  enjoy the more extravagant Limited, but the XLE is the sweet spot in our  opinion.  The  standard powertrain on the base LE is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine (185 horsepower, 184 pound-feet of torque),  a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. The 3.5-liter V6 (295  hp, 263 lb-ft) that's standard on all other trims is optional on the LE and  comes paired with an eight-speed automatic. All-wheel drive can be added to the  V6 as an option. Other  standard features include 18-inch alloy wheels, heated mirrors, a windshield  wiper de-icer, rear privacy glass, the Toyota Safety Sense bundle (automatic  high beams, adaptive cruise control, lane departure intervention, and Toyota's  Pre-Collision System, which bundles forward collision detection with automatic  emergency braking, a rearview camera, rear air conditioning, a  height-adjustable driver's seat, a 60/40-split second-row seat (slides,  reclines, folds), a 60/40-split third-row seat (reclines, folds), five USB  ports, a 6.1-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker sound system with a  CD player. The LE Plus adds a height-adjustable  power liftgate, a flip-up rear window, foglights, tri-zone automatic climate  control, upgraded upholstery and trim, a power-adjustable driver seat, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, a higher-resolution 8-inch touchscreen,  satellite and HD radio, and a variety of smartphone-connection apps. On  top of the LE Plus' equipment, the Highlander XLE adds a sunroof, roof rails, keyless entry and ignition,  blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems, an upgraded instrument  panel, leather upholstery (first and second rows), simulated leather third-row  upholstery, heated front seats, a power-adjustable passenger seat, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, second-row window sunshades, a 110-volt power  outlet, Driver Easy Speak (carries the driver's voice through the rear speakers  to distant passengers) and a navigation system.  The SE is equipped similarly to the XLE  but has LED running lights, sport-themed styling elements and suspension  tuning, 19-inch wheels and sporty interior trim.  The Limited starts with the XLE's  content and adds LED running lights, different 19-inch wheels, rear parking  sensors, a rear cargo cover, heated and ventilated front seats, driver-seat  memory settings, heated second-row captain's chairs (optional on the XLE) and a  12-speaker JBL audio system.  The Limited Platinum gains a panoramic  sunroof, automatic wipers, a 360-degree parking camera, front parking sensors,  Safety Connect emergency communications, a heated steering wheel and heated  second-row seats. The  Limited and Limited Platinum can be optionally equipped with the second-row  bench. A rear-seat entertainment system is optional on all but the LE and LE  Plus.",

    "full_description": "The 2018 Toyota Avalon Hybrid carries over unchanged. Most of today's big family sedans  offer roomy interiors, plenty of standard features and large trunks. But none  offer the fuel efficiency of the 2018 Toyota Avalon Hybrid. That's because the  Avalon Hybrid uses a four-cylinder engine and electric motor combination to achieve  40 mpg in combined driving, according to EPA estimates. That's not quite as  much compared to what you can get from Toyota's Prius or Honda Accord Hybrid,  but it's nonetheless impressive given the Avalon Hybrid's size and its  substantial offering of useful features. No other large sedan or hybrid  crossover today can match it.  But  beyond its fuel efficiency, the Avalon Hybrid is simply an excellent large  sedan. Its cushioned ride and hushed cabin make it equally suited to commutes  and road trips, and its roomy interior offers plenty of room for five  passengers to spread out. And with standard features that include a sunroof,  leather upholstery and heated seats, even the base trim level Avalon Hybrid  comes well stocked. Opting up to the Limited trim brings near Lexus-like  appointments and luxury. As a five-passenger, full-size sedan that achieves  exceptional fuel economy, the Avalon Hybrid stands alone.  Most of today's big family sedans offer roomy interiors, plenty of standard features and large trunks. But none offer the fuel efficiency of the 2018 Toyota Avalon Hybrid. You'll like how it sips gas more like an economy compact car. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the 2013 Toyota Avalon Hybrid (2.5L inline-4  hybrid | CVT automatic | FWD) as well as a 2017  Toyota Avalon Limited (3.5-liter V6 | 6-speed automatic | FWD).NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Avalon Hybrid has received some  revisions, including a redesigned front end, the latest generation of the  Entune infotainment system, and the inclusion of standard driver assistance  features. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Avalon Hybrid.  The Avalon Hybrid needs 7.7 seconds to hit 60 mph. A regular Avalon with a V6 is quicker, but the hybrid is suitably powerful for everyday driving. As is usually the case with hybrids, the Avalon's brake pedal requires some getting used to. Most drivers will adjust to its unusual response. Stopping distances are adequate. Steering weight in the Avalon is light in nearly every situation, but it isn't lacking accuracy. Very easy to drive. The Avalon can feel a bit floaty when you drive over a few bumps in a road, and a tight on-ramp or winding mountain road can expose a nose-heavy feel. Given the expectations of a big hybrid sedan, however, the Avalon is certainly satisfactory. With the exception of its brake response, the Avalon is exceptionally easy to drive. It's as user-friendly as it should be, so much so you'll forget you're driving a hybrid. Toyota does this well. The Avalon's driver seat is both amply adjustable and long-haul pleasant. But the rear seats are flatter and have less give. They're not as comfortable as the fronts on long drives. This is the plush, cloudlike ride that interstate drivers long for. It's softly sprung. Bumpy roads can overwhelm the suspension, though, and the Avalon can get a bit too floaty. One of the quietest cars we've tested in recent memory. Road, wind and tire noise is virtually nonexistent. Most primary controls and secondary switches are well-marked. But the steering wheel blocks the view of the volume knob and some crucial buttons to the left of the touchscreen. These buttons are touch-sensitive, but they offer no tactile feedback so you must look to see where your fingers are going. The wide door openings, ample space and comfortable seat height make for easy ingress and egress for front and rear passengers. The seats have a good deal of adjustment and can accommodate both sit-up and more reclined drivers. But some taller drivers may have a hard time finding the ideal driving position, not because of the seats but because the telescopic steering mechanism has a limited range of extension. This car provides ample space for a long road trip, front and rear. Everyone enjoys great leg- and headroom and elbow room. The only potential drawback we can see is slightly limited toe room in the rear seat if the corresponding front seat is set to its lowest height. We observed no significant visibility shortcomings while driving the Avalon. Rear-quarter visibility is adequate. Parking sensors are optional. Toyota's efforts to move the Avalon upscale are obvious. Panel gaps and interior assembly were good on our test car. The front door pockets are small and can't hold bottles. The center console has a moderately large cargo box with a removable second-level tray. A retractable Qi charging platform sits in front of the shifter. The rear seats have even smaller door pockets, with cupholders in the fold-down armrest. At 14 cubic feet, trunk space is very good, especially for a car with batteries consuming some of its cargo volume. LATCH anchors are easy to grasp but difficult to engage due to the seat material that surrounds it. Upper LATCH points are easy to access. Generous rear kneeroom means you don't have to scoot the front seats up much when installing a bulky rear-facing seat. The JBL audio system is effective at pop vocals, but with a mildly muted midbass area you may find yourself raising the volume on rock, jazz and classical. Navigation maps are built in and don't require a paired phone. The lack of direct access to maps is a minus; you have to hit \"Home\" first. Phone connectivity is excellent and quick. The Bluetooth system works great, and if you have a modern phone, you can even search individual albums and playlists. There's also a USB and auxiliary-in jack up front underneath the Qi induction charger. It comes standard with automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assistance and adaptive cruise control, but the latter does not function below about 30 mph. Passive equipment includes lane departure warning, front and rear parking sensors, and a relatively low-resolution, rear-facing camera. Toyota's voice control is adequate so long as you understand its syntax and follow it accordingly. Voice control works for using navigation and the radio and passing voice commands to your smartphone. You can also call up certain apps and weather information. With  a sunroof, heated seats, leather upholstery, and a comprehensive list of other  convenience and safety features, the 2018 Toyota Avalon Hybrid XLE Plus offers exceptional bang for  the buck. For a base model, it's very nicely equipped. You can get features  such as wireless smartphone charging, driver-seat memory settings and a nicer  sound system by moving up to the XLE Premium, but we think the XLE Plus offers  plenty to satisfy most buyers seeking excellent fuel economy from a comfortable  large sedan. Standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, heated side  mirrors, a sunroof, a power rear window sunshade, keyless ignition and entry,  dual-zone climate control, leather upholstery, heated and power-adjustable  front seats, Bluetooth, a rearview camera, a 7-inch touchscreen with Toyota's  Entune interface, voice controls, and an eight-speaker sound system with CD  player, satellite radio and a USB input. The base Avalon also comes with driver aids that include  automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning (with  pedestrian detection), automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and  lane departure warning and intervention.The XLE Premium offers upgrades that include foglights, driver-seat memory settings, a wireless  smartphone charging tray, and the Entune Premium Audio system, which bundles  navigation, a nine-speaker audio system, smartphone app integration, blind-spot  monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.The Limited includes the features listed above along with xenon headlights, automatic  wipers, tri-zone automatic climate control, upgraded leather upholstery,  ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, Safety Connect emergency notification and roadside  assistance services, and an 11-speaker JBL premium sound system.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota Sienna remains unchanged for the 2010 model year. Roomy, comfortable and well-built, the 2010 Toyota Sienna minivan is an excellent choice for larger families. If you're searching for a high-quality minivan, you don't have to go any further than the 2010 Toyota Sienna. It's reliable, easy to drive and simply a solid choice when it comes to family haulers. Although the Sienna is unchanged from last year, it remains one of the best minivans you can buy. Budget-minded shoppers will like the low-priced Sienna CE that has room for up to eight passengers. Those who can spend considerably more will appreciate how the Sienna Limited comes off like nothing less than a Lexus minivan.All Sienna trim levels come with Toyota's familiar 3.5-liter V6, an all-star engine renowned for its smooth power and high fuel efficiency. Another feather in the Sienna's cap is the fact that it's currently the only minivan to be offered with all-wheel drive, so if you live where ice and snow are common, the Sienna has a decided advantage over its rivals.There are a few downsides, though. The 2010 Toyota Sienna lacks some of the high-end entertainment features that are available on the Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan twins. And the Sienna is neither as slick nor as responsive to drive as the Honda Odyssey. Of course, no minivan is going to be purchased for its corner-carving ability, but it is worth noting that piloting a Sienna is about as bland as it gets.One might also be concerned about the Sienna's pricing -- Kia's Sedona delivers much of the same utility as the Sienna but for less money. But the aforementioned strengths as well as Toyota's high resale value and strong reputation for reliability will likely be enough for many shoppers to choose this minivan. Overall, the Sienna is an excellent van, with many compelling features and options. We wouldn't buy another minivan without trying the Sienna first. All Siennas come with a 266-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 engine that's matched to a five-speed automatic transmission. This refined combination provides brisk acceleration (we timed an AWD version of the XLE from zero to 60 mph in just 8.0 seconds) as well as respectable fuel economy. EPA estimates come in at 17 mpg city/23 mpg highway and 19 mpg combined for front-wheel-drive models; the AWD versions are rated at 16 city/21 highway and 18 combined. Antilock disc brakes, stability control, traction control and a full complement of airbags (including front-seat side and full-length side curtain) are standard on all Siennas. The Limited also comes with front and rear park assist; it's optional on the XLE. If you opt for the navigation system, you'll also get a rearview camera.In government crash testing, the 2010 Toyota Sienna earned four stars (out of five possible) for driver protection in frontal impacts and five stars for the front passenger. It also received five stars across the board for side-impact crash protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave Toyota's minivan a \"Good\" rating (the highest possible score) for its performance in frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. Although the 2010 Toyota Sienna's automatic transmission is calibrated more for fuel economy than performance, there's no denying the refined potency of the van's V6. When you step into it, acceleration is spirited, yet the engine delivers its power in a smooth and unobtrusive manner. Ride quality is plush, but the Sienna offers minimal steering feedback and considerable body roll during cornering. Braking distances are class-competitive, but the brake pedal has an overly soft feel. The Sienna's cabin is handsomely fitted with high-quality fabric on lower trim levels and leather and faux wood on the higher-end models. The various controls are simple to use, storage space is plentiful and the seats are plush. Seven-passenger Siennas allow the second-row captain's chairs to be pushed together to create a bench seat. The eight-passenger version uses a 40/20/40-split second-row bench whose center section slides 13 inches closer to the front seats for easier access to the little one seated there. The Sienna provides a cavernous 149 cubic feet of maximum cargo capacity. In Limited trim, the Sienna's interior looks and feels as if it came straight out of a luxury car. The base Sienna CE includes 16-inch steel wheels, dual sliding rear doors with power-down windows, front and rear air-conditioning, a six-speaker CD/MP3 stereo with an auxiliary audio jack, a telescoping steering wheel and full power accessories. The LE adds privacy and solar-energy-absorbing glass, a roof rack, heated side mirrors, a CD changer, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, a folding front passenger seat, cruise control and upgraded instrumentation.The Sienna XLE features alloy wheels, power-sliding rear doors, a power liftgate, automatic headlamps, tri-zone automatic climate control, power front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, wood grain interior trim, a trip computer and a removable center console. The plush Limited adds 17-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof, leather upholstery, heated front seats, driver memory settings, a leather-and-wood steering wheel, an upgraded 10-speaker JBL surround-sound audio system, satellite radio, Bluetooth, rear window shades and a windshield wiper de-icer. All-wheel-drive Siennas receive 17-inch wheels, run-flat tires and the wiper de-icer.Options on the Toyota Sienna are grouped into packages that vary based on buying region, and they can get rather pricey. You'll need to study them carefully to ensure that the Sienna you pick has the options you want. Notable items include xenon headlights, adaptive cruise control, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, a navigation system (with a back-up camera), a power-folding third-row seat and a pair of 115-volt power outlets.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota Camry Hybrid receives a thorough overhaul for 2015, a mere three years after a complete redesign. Highlights include all-new exterior styling, improved handling and a revised interior with more equipment and better materials. With its improvements to cabin quality and handling, the 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid is a more compelling and competitive midsize hybrid sedan that still boasts generous interior space and a solid reputation for reliability. Toyota typically  redesigns its cars every five or six years. Within that time period, it usually  makes a few minor updates but otherwise leaves them alone until the next major  overhaul. So it's a little surprising that Toyota has given the 2015 Camry  Hybrid a fairly significant update just three years after the car's last  redesign. Whatever the reasons for this more comprehensive batch of changes, Toyota  has essentially corrected the few weak areas on last year's Camry Hybrid.\nThe changes start with the exterior styling. The new grille  is larger and more aggressive-looking and provides a closer familial tie-in  with those used on the Camry's pricier Avalon and even Lexus relatives. More sculpted body sides  replace the former slab-sided design, and the taillights now look cohesive, as  opposed to the former disjointed units that looked as if they had been sourced  from two different cars. It's a similar story inside, as improved materials  quality, notably in the center console and door panel areas, boosts the  refinement factor. Even the climate control buttons and knobs are larger and  imbue a sense of higher quality. The overall effect is that of a more upscale  sedan.\nToyota didn't fiddle with the sedan's gasoline-electric hybrid  powertrain, which means you've got a 2.5-liter engine and electric motor combo  good for 200 horsepower and an EPA-estimated 41 mpg in combined driving. But  Toyota did tweak the Camry's body structure and suspension tuning this year to provide  a more buttoned-down demeanor when you're driving around turns. Choose the  sport-tuned SE version and you'll have an even more responsive and engaging  feel. It may still not be quite as involving as the Fusion Hybrid, mind you,  but most people should find the SE pretty satisfying.\nAs with past versions, the 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid also  boasts comfortable seating front and rear, good outward visibility and a smooth  and quiet ride. Downsides are minor on the hybrid Camry. The steering provides  little in the way of feedback, while fuel economy, though generally impressive,  still falls short of the class leaders, which earn combined ratings in the mid to  high 40s.\nThose class leaders are the 2015 Ford  Fusion Hybrid and the 2015 Honda Accord  Hybrid. Both have slightly better fuel economy numbers and are a little sportier  to drive. But compared with a rival like the 2015 Hyundai  Sonata Hybrid, the Toyota offers a smoother-operating hybrid system and  better fuel economy. It also provides a lot more room inside than the Volkswagen  Jetta Hybrid. Newly invigorated, the 2015 Camry Hybrid merits strong consideration  from shoppers looking for a comfortable, gas-sipping family car. The 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid pairs a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and battery pack. Working together,  the two power sources crank out a combined output of 200 hp. A continuously variable  transmission (CVT) delivers power to the front wheels. We haven't yet tested a  2015 model, but the last Camry Hybrid XLE we evaluated accelerated from zero to  60 mph in 7.6 seconds, a quick time for a hybrid midsize sedan.\nEPA-estimated  fuel economy for the Camry Hybrid LE is 41 mpg combined (43 city/39 highway). Interestingly, the XLE achieves 40 mpg combined (40 city/38 highway), likely due to the increased rolling resistance of its  larger wheels and tires. The 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid comes with antilock brakes,  stability and traction control, a rearview camera, front and rear seat side  airbags, side curtain airbags and knee airbags for both driver and passenger. On  the XLE you can also get a blind spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic  alerts, lane departure warning, frontal collision warning and a frontal  collision mitigation system that includes automatic braking. The XLE's optional  Safety Connect telematics system includes emergency assistance, stolen-vehicle  notification and automatic collision notification.\nIn government crash tests, the 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid received  five stars (out of five possible) for overall crash protection with four  stars for frontal crash protection and five stars for side crash protection. The  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the standard (non-hybrid) Camry its best  possible rating of \"Good\" in its moderate-overlap and  small-overlap frontal-offset impact tests. The Camry also earned a  \"Good\" score in the side-impact, roof strength and head restraint  (whiplash protection) tests. The 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid is, for the most part,  dynamically well-rounded. Thanks to careful suspension tuning, it grips the  road well, and the ride is mostly undisturbed by bumps and ruts. Most drivers  will find the steering precise, but if you're more demanding, you might notice  its lack of road feel. In that case we'd steer you toward the Fusion Hybrid,  which has crisper, more direct steering.\nThat said, Toyota's hybrid drivetrain remains one of the  most sophisticated and refined systems of its kind. The transition from  all-electric mode to the gasoline engine is less noticeable in the Camry Hybrid  than in the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, for example. All the while, acceleration is  strong for a midsize, non-premium-brand hybrid sedan. The 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid is blessed with one of the most  comfortable and spacious cabins in the midsize family sedan segment. Even tall  adults will find plenty of space above their heads and in front of their knees,  while a rear-facing car seat will fit in back with ease. The fixed rear  headrests make it difficult to properly secure a front-facing child seat,  though.\nUp front, the center stack's buttons are big, easy to read  at a glance and glove-friendly without being comically large or ugly. This is  especially true of the sensibly designed climate controls. Every Camry Hybrid gets  a standard 6.1-inch Entune touchscreen  interface, which controls the audio system, available smartphone-integrated  apps and the optional navigation system. Not many of these modern interfaces are  truly user-friendly, but Entune is one of the better and simpler ones  available.\nWith 13.1 cubic feet, the trunk offers respectable  capacity for a hybrid sedan (hybrids typically sacrifice some space to their  under-floor battery packs). The rear seat is split 60/40, and the passenger  side (the larger \"60\" portion) folds down for added cargo capacity. \nThe LE Hybrid features 16-inch steel wheels, automatic  headlights, heated exterior mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, a rearview  camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, full power accessories, an  eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar), cruise control, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a trip computer, Bluetooth phone and audio  connectivity, a 6.1-inch display and the base Entune Audio system, which  includes a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, an auxiliary input and a  USB/iPod interface.\nThe SE Hybrid adds a unique grille, black headlight  surrounds, 17-inch alloy wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, a rear spoiler, sport  fabric seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and silver interior accents.\nThe XLE Hybrid includes the LE features along with 17-inch  alloy wheels, foglights, LED running lights, a chrome exhaust tip, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a  four-way power passenger seat and Entune Audio Plus, which adds satellite radio  and HD radio.\nEntune Audio Plus is optional on the LE and SE. The SE can  also be had with a sunroof, a Qi wireless cell  phone charger and the Entune Premium Audio with Navigation and App suite, which  includes Entune Audio Plus features along with a 7-inch touchscreen, a  navigation system and various integrated smartphone apps.\nThe XLE offers those SE options as well. Also optional on  the XLE is a 10-speaker JBL audio system (bundled with the upgraded Entune  navigation package), an Advance Technology package (automatic high beam  headlight control, adaptive cruise control, a forward collision warning system  and lane departure warning), a Safety  Connect package (detailed below in the Safety section) and a blind spot and  rear cross-traffic warning system.",

    "full_description": "The 2016 Toyota Sequoia gets infotainment system upgrades and, for the Limited trim, an optional blind spot monitoring system. When it comes to traditional, full-size SUVs the 2016 Toyota Sequoia is worth a look. It has legitimate off-road capability, high towing capacity and seating for eight. If your needs are less extreme, though, a large, three-row crossover will likely serve you better.  Let's say you've got a boat, some water-skis, a spouse, four  kids and their stuff. Now all you need is a vehicle to haul them around. With  its 2016 Sequoia full-size SUV, Toyota may  just be able to help.\n\nThe 2016 Toyota Sequoia  is a big, truck-based SUV that's roomy enough to be a home away from home  during a family outing.\nWhile the Sequoia hasn't received any significant changes  this year (or for the last several years, for that matter) it's still a viable  choice for a big family. The Sequoia is built on the same basic architecture as  the rugged Toyota Tundra pickup. Despite its pickup roots, the 2016 Sequoia is  comfortable on the road, especially when equipped with the optional adaptive  air suspension. The Sequoia has received an Edmunds \"B\"  rating.\nFor power, there's only one engine available in the 2016 Toyota  Sequoia, but it's capable of towing up to 7,400 pounds. And even though this is  a pretty hulking vehicle, acceleration is quick. When you want to venture off  the pavement, the Sequoia is plenty capable thanks to ample ground clearance  and a sturdy suspension.\nUnfortunately, it also is a bit stale. The Sequoia hasn't  been redesigned in years, and its age shows. Interior quality is lacking, and  the stereo controls are located far away from the driver. Rivals have also  moved the bar in regard to fuel economy, and the Sequoia's rating of just 14  mpg in combined driving is pretty low.\nThat said, the other full-size SUVs on the market aren't  necessarily superior overall. The 2016 Chevrolet Tahoe and  its big brother, the 2016  Suburban, each received a recent redesign, for instance, and both are quiet  and have richer, more modern interiors. But each received a \"C\"  rating from our editors. The 2016 Ford Expedition is  a better alternative. It received a less substantial overhaul than its  Chevrolet competitors, but benefits from a fuel-efficient turbocharged  six-cylinder engine and, like the Sequoia, features an easy-to-use fold-flat  third-row seat.\nOf course, if you don't need the sort of max capabilities  offered by truck-based beasts of burden like the Sequoia, a large crossover  like the 2016 Chevrolet  Traverse or the Edmunds \"A\"-rated Toyota Highlander will deliver  room for a big family but with lower fuel consumption and a less cumbersome  driving experience. The 2016 Toyota Sequoia comes standard with a 5.7-liter V8  engine rated at 381 hp and 401 pound-feet of torque. The V8 is paired with a  six-speed automatic transmission that sends power to the rear wheels. A  four-wheel-drive system with low-range gearing and a locking limited-slip  center differential is available as an option.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, a Sequoia Premium 4WD went  from zero to 60 mph in 6.9 seconds.\nAs you'd expect from a full-size, truck-based SUV, the EPA-estimated  fuel economy is only 15 mpg in combined driving (13 city/17 highway) with  rear-wheel drive, and 14 mpg combined (13/17)  with 4WD, despite the same city and highway mileage. These ratings are much  lower than competitors' fuel economy. In states that don't use California  emissions standards, the 4WD Sequoia also can be configured as a flex-fuel  vehicle, capable of using either standard gasoline or the E85 blend of 85  percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. Fuel efficiency falls to 10 mpg  combined (9/13) when using E85.\nDepending on your choice of trim level and whether you get  two- or four-wheel drive, the Sequoia is capable of towing between 7,100 and  7,400 pounds. Standard safety equipment for all 2016 Toyota Sequoia models  includes antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, trailer sway  control, front knee airbags, front seat side-impact airbags, full-length side  curtain airbags and a rearview camera. The Limited adds standard front and rear  parking sensors and an optional blind spot monitoring system. Adaptive cruise  control and blind spot monitoring are standard on the Platinum.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Sequoia needed 125 feet to  come to a stop from 60 mph, an average distance for a vehicle of this size.\nIn government crash testing, the 2016 Sequoia received four  stars (out of five) for rollover protection. It was not rated for front or  side collision protection. There may not be multiple engines to choose from in the 2016  Toyota Sequoia, but the gutsy 5.7-liter V8 isn't a slouch. This engine provides  impressive acceleration, even in this large, heavy vehicle. The six-speed  automatic transmission also performs flawlessly, with smooth, predictable  shifts in everyday driving.\nThe Sequoia's ride quality is quite smooth for its class,  especially compared to its more trucklike GM competitors, and should feel  downright plush with the adaptive air suspension. The Sequoia also stands out  with its available locking center differential and low-range gearbox, which  makes it more capable off-road than most big family vehicles. As with its  competitors, though, there's no getting around the Sequoia's supersized  dimensions and challenging outward visibility. Maneuvering in tight confines  such as parking garages can be a hassle, but the standard rearview camera certainly  helps. Inside the 2016 Toyota Sequoia you'll find a spacious and  comfortable cabin with room for as many as eight passengers. Models fitted with  the available second-row captain's chairs have a bit more of a deluxe feel, but  it's hard to find fault with the standard 40/20/40-split bench. Its individual  sections can be reclined, adjusted farther back for greater comfort or scooted  forward to keep youngsters close at hand. The third row also reclines.\nThe quality of both the materials and construction is only average,  but it's still nicer than you might expect given the Sequoia's rugged  truck-based origins. Gauges and controls are generally well placed and easy to  use, with the exception being the Entune touchscreen audio controls that  require a long reach for many drivers. Also, getting  started with Entune's available suite of smartphone apps can take some extra  time since you have to install an app on your phone and register for an  account; plus, you always need an active data connection to use it.\n\n\"Cavernous\"  may be the best way to describe the Toyota Sequoia's yawning cargo hold.\nWith all seats in place, there are 18.9 cubic feet of space  behind the third row. This matches the Ford Expedition, but is a few cubes more  than a Chevrolet Tahoe and many more than most large crossovers. Fold the third  row of seats and the Sequoia shines with a healthy 66.6 cubic feet of cargo  space. Folding both rows down opens up a cavernous 120-cubic-foot cargo hold,  which is considerably more than the Tahoe and Expedition (only a Chevrolet  Suburban or Ford Expedition EL would be bigger). Plus, the third-row seats fold  flat without the sort of awkward, raised load floor found in GM's SUVs. \nThe base trim level SR5 model comes with lots of standard  features, including 18-inch alloy wheels, foglights, a windshield wiper  de-icer, heated mirrors, sunroof, keyless entry, roof rack, running boards,  rear privacy glass, a power rear window and towing preparation. Inside you get  tri-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, an eight-way power driver  seat, a 40/20/40-split second-row bench seat (with sliding and reclining  functionality), a 60/40-split reclining and fold-flat third-row bench, second-  and third-row side sunshades, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with audio  and Bluetooth phone controls, a rearview camera and an eight-speaker audio  system with Toyota's  Entune Audio Plus with 6.1-inch touchscreen,  Connected Navigation (via smartphone), Siri Eyes Free smartphone voice control  mode (for iPhone users), a CD player, satellite radio, HD radio, an auxiliary  audio jack and a USB/iPod interface.\nOptions for the SR5 include a Sport package with 20-inch  chrome alloy wheels, a color-keyed grille and second-row captain's chairs  (reducing seating capacity to seven).\nThe separately available SR5 Premium package retains  eight-passenger seating and bundles an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather  upholstery, power driver-seat lumbar adjustment, a four-way power passenger  seat, heated front seats, a power-reclining and -folding third-row seat and a  navigation system with a full suite of smartphone apps such as Pandora and  OpenTable. The navigation system and auto-dimming mirror are available as  stand-alone options.\n\nA roomy cabin helps  keep the 2016 Sequoia appealing, but it is a stretch from the driver seat to  the touchscreen audio controls.\nStepping up to the Limited model gets you 20-inch alloy  wheels, power-folding and auto-dimming outside mirrors, front and rear parking  sensors and a power liftgate. Inside, everything from the SR5's Premium package  is included as standard, along with a leather-wrapped steering wheel,  leather-trimmed doors and upgraded gauges.. A new Safety and Convenience option  package adds a blind spot monitoring system and driver-seat memory functions. A  14-speaker JBL sound system is optional, as is a rear seat entertainment system  with a Blu-ray player and a single 9-inch display.\nThe top-of-the-line Platinum trim level comes standard with  all of the above features, plus different 20-inch wheels, an adaptive air  suspension (with a load-leveling rear), adaptive cruise control, heated and  ventilated front seats, power-adjustable driver seat thigh support, heated  second-row captain's chairs (reduces seating capacity to seven), a second-row  center console, a power-adjustable steering wheel and a premium JBL audio  system.",

    "full_description": "The 2008 Toyota Sienna sees no significant changes. Roomy, comfortable and well-built, the 2008 Toyota Sienna minivan is an easy choice, especially if you have a big family. Ever since its last makeover four years ago, the Toyota Sienna has been a top choice in the minivan segment for consumers and automotive critics alike. Things got even better last year, when Toyota updated the minivan with a new, 266-horsepower V6 that improved performance while remaining as fuel-efficient as the previous (and less powerful) engine. For 2008, the Toyota Sienna stands pat, and that sits just fine with us.As you might expect from a Toyota product, the Sienna has a comfortable ride, earns respectable gas mileage and has top-notch safety ratings. It's also one of the roomiest minivans available and one of the few that offers eight-passenger capacity and all-wheel drive. Inside, the Sienna can be fitted with luxury features not typically seen on a minivan, such as a telescoping steering wheel, adaptive cruise control and rear sunshades. If Lexus made a minivan, we imagine it would be a lot like the Sienna.Although it's got plenty of power, the Sienna still isn't the best choice for those looking for at least some driving involvement due to its softly tuned suspension and numb steering. Granted, most people buying a minivan are more concerned with getting all the kids to school and sports activities than tearing it up on a twisting road. However, those who'd like a more carlike experience behind the wheel of their family shuttle would be better served by the Honda Odyssey, which is as close to a sporty sedan as a minivan gets.Besides the Honda, there are a few other minivans you might want to consider. The redesigned Dodge and Chrysler minivans offer a number of segment-exclusive features this year, and the less expensive Hyundai Entourage/Kia Sedona twins provide better value than the Sienna. But overall, the 2008 Toyota Sienna remains one of the best choices out there, especially if price isn't a huge concern. A superb 3.5-liter V6 engine with 266 hp matched to a five-speed automatic transmission is featured on every 2008 Sienna. This refined combination provides brisk performance (we timed an AWD version of the XLE from zero to 60 mph in just 8.0 seconds) as well as respectable gas mileage. The revised 2008 EPA figures come in at 17 mpg city and 24 mpg highway for front-drive models, while the AWD versions rate 16 and 21, respectively. Antilock disc brakes, stability control, traction control and a full complement of airbags (including front-seat side and full-length side curtain) are standard on all Siennas. The XLE Limited also comes with front and rear park assist, while rear park assist is available on LE and XLE trims. If you opt for the navigation system, you'll also get a handy rearview camera.In government crash testing, the 2008 Toyota Sienna earned four stars (out of five) for driver protection in frontal impacts and five stars for the front passenger. It also received five stars across the board for side-impact crash protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave Toyota's minivan a \"Good\" rating (its highest) for its performance in both frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. Although the 2008 Toyota Sienna's automatic transmission is calibrated more for fuel economy than performance and thus tends to shift conservatively, there's no denying the potency of the new V6 when you step into it. Acceleration is spirited in most situations, and the engine delivers its power in a quiet, refined manner. Ride quality is smooth and comfortable, but the Sienna offers little inspiration in the handling department. It feels secure enough when going around corners, but with minimal steering feedback and considerable body roll, it's not a minivan you'll relish driving. Braking distances are on par with the rest of the minivan class, but pedal feel is too soft to inspire confidence. The Sienna's spacious cabin is handsomely fitted with high-quality fabric on lower trim levels, and leather and faux wood on the higher-end models. The various controls are simple to use, storage space is plentiful and the seats are plush. Seven-passenger vans allow the second-row captain's chairs to be pushed together to create a bench seat. The eight-passenger version uses a 40/20/40-split bench in the second row whose center section slides 13 inches closer to the front seats for easier access to the little one seated there. The Sienna provides a cavernous 149 cubic feet of cargo capacity. The base Sienna CE includes 16-inch steel wheels, dual sliding rear doors with power-down windows, front and rear air-conditioning, a six-speaker CD stereo with an auxiliary audio jack, a telescoping steering wheel and full power accessories. The LE adds privacy and solar energy-absorbing glass, a roof rack, heated mirrors, a CD changer, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, a folding front passenger seat, cruise control and upgraded instrumentation.The Sienna XLE features alloy wheels, power-sliding rear doors, a power liftgate, automatic headlamps, tri-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, wood-grain interior trim, a trip computer and a removable center console. The plush XLE Limited adds 17-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof, adaptive cruise control, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a leather/wood steering wheel, an upgraded 10-speaker JBL sound system, rear window shades and a windshield wiper de-icer. All-wheel-drive Siennas automatically receive 17-inch wheels, run-flat tires and the wiper de-icer.Options on the Toyota Sienna are grouped into packages that vary based on buying region, and they can get rather pricey. You'll need to study them carefully to ensure the one you pick has just what you want. Notable items include xenon headlights, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, a navigation system (with a back-up camera and Bluetooth), a power-folding third-row seat and a pair of 115-volt power outlets.",

    "full_description": "For  much of its existence, the Toyota Corolla has been practical and comfortable  but not particularly bursting with character. But the 2021 Toyota Corolla  hatchback might surprise you with its stylish looks and appealing driving  performance. Even better, these qualities don't diminish comfort or utility.  Compared to the Corolla sedan, the hatchback has more cargo space and makes it  easier to load bulky items.  \nChanges  for the 2021 model are few, but the addition of more safety equipment and the  new Special Edition trim level are certainly welcome. Overall, the Corolla  hatchback is a solid pick for a small hatchback alongside other top rivals such  as the Honda Civic hatchback, Hyundai Elantra GT and Mazda 3 hatchback. Read  our Expert Rating below to learn more about whether the Corolla hatch is right  for you. We  suggest going with the top-level XSE model with the continuously variable automatic transmission. Yes, it's the most  expensive version in the lineup, but features including dual-zone automatic  climate control and a power-adjustable driver's seat make it worth the premium. How does the Corolla Hatchback drive? It has a relatively small engine, but the Corolla hatchback's power is adequate. Our manual-equipped test car covered 0-60 mph in 7.8 seconds, which is an average time for this type of car. The brakes are also adequately powerful for emergency stops and are easy to control for smooth stops in typical driving. \n\n   The steering doesn't give you much of a feel for the road, but it's quick to respond. Along with the car's balanced handling, the Corolla hatchback makes a sporty initial impression. On a twisty road, this little hatchback is surprisingly fun and engaging. How comfortable is the Corolla Hatchback? The Corolla hatchback strikes a great balance between comfort and composure. It might be a bit soft over freeway undulations, but the body stays well under control. Go with the SE trim and its smaller 16-inch wheels for maximum comfort. The XSE rides a bit rougher because of its bigger wheels and skinnier sidewall tires. \n\n   On the open road, you'll appreciate the fairly quiet interior. The front seats will also appeal to a wide variety of drivers and are relatively comfortable even over long journeys. Airflow from the climate control system is effective at both heating and cooling. How\u2019s the interior? The Corolla's climate control buttons are a bit crowded and the infotainment buttons are a bit small, but you can figure things out relatively quickly. There's ample access to the front seats thanks to a large door opening, and the seat height makes getting in and out a breeze. \n\n   Adjustments can be made quickly, and drivers of varying sizes will be able to get comfortable behind the tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel. The rear should be OK for most passengers, but taller passengers will desire more legroom. As you'd expect from a compact hatchback, there's great visibility in every direction. A low hoodline aids forward visibility, while plenty of side glass makes lane changes stress-free. How\u2019s the tech? The Corolla hatch comes standard with automated emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, auto high-beam control and lane keeping assist \u2014 an impressive array for a car in this price range. The high-mounted 8-inch touchscreen is visually appealing, but various speed-related lockouts and a lack of a native navigation system make for a frustrating experience. The decent audio system helps, but other cars have much better.\n\n   The native voice recognition system is reasonably accurate as long as you follow the tutorial and set up the system to recognize your voice. Thankfully, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now included and are effective voice command work-arounds. How\u2019s the storage? A small, practical hatchback can be a surprisingly versatile car, but a high floor spoils the Corolla's cargo space. Behind the rear seats you get 17.8 cubic feet. But competitors such as the Honda Civic and the Hyundai Elantra GT offer more. \n\n   The door pockets and decent cupholders mean there's some room for small items. In front of the shift lever, there's a shelf that looks to be for a phone, but it's not really big enough to hold one. The center console bin is also a bit small and awkward to reach into. For family duty, the Corolla has a decent amount of space for rear-facing child safety seats. The car seat anchors are easily accessible. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Corolla hatchback gets an EPA-estimated 31 mpg combined with the six-speed manual transmission or up to a rather impressive 35 mpg with the automatic. Our manual-equipped test car returned 30 mpg on our 115-mile evaluation route. Our total test fuel economy with random driving mixed in was a more lackluster 25.9 mpg, but we believe the EPA estimate should be achievable for most drivers. Is the Corolla Hatchback a good value? The Corolla hatchback is well built, offers good fuel economy, and comes with a lot of standard safety features. Overall warranty coverage is average, though you do get free scheduled maintenance for services such as oil changes and tire rotations for the first two years/25,000 miles. \"Surprising\" might be the best word to describe the Corolla hatchback. Its styling and upscale interior push the Corolla name a little more upmarket. And its compliant ride, fun handling and willing engine make it genuinely fun. All that and an available manual transmission give it real potential as a fun-to-drive hatchback even if it doesn't quite make it into hot-hatch territory.",

    "full_description": "After a complete redesign last year, the 2009 Toyota Highlander Hybrid remains unchanged. The 2009 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is an ideal choice for shoppers wanting a vehicle that offers high fuel economy and seven-passenger practicality. There's no denying that most hybrid passenger cars save on fuel costs. A side benefit is the feeling that you're helping to reduce our oil dependence and pollution output. But hybrid SUVs are more of a mixed bag. While these vehicles may sport \"Hybrid\" badges that give their owners the warm green fuzzies, they often offer only marginal environmental improvements over their conventionally powered counterparts.Such is not the case with the 2009 Toyota Highlander Hybrid, which genuinely boasts the best of both worlds. Although it's a fairly large crossover SUV, the Highlander Hybrid turns in a very respectable 26 mpg in the EPA's combined fuel economy estimate, which is 6-7 mpg better than the conventional V6-powered Highlander. Yet this superior fuel economy doesn't come at the expense of power. The V6 and electric motor combo provides remarkably brisk and seamless acceleration. At the same time, the Highlander offers the same advantages as the regular Highlander, including an attractively designed and versatile cabin with comfortable seating for up to seven passengers.This all-around excellence helps the Highlander stand out from other competitors, hybrid or otherwise. This isn't to say there aren't drawbacks, however. Even in base form, the Highlander Hybrid is more expensive than the loaded-up Limited variant of the regular Highlander. And although the Highlander is all-wheel drive, we don't think the Hybrid's AWD is as effective as a more traditional AWD setup. Still, for crossover shoppers with environmental leanings looking for a seven-passenger vehicle, Toyota proves there can be only one -- the Highlander Hybrid. The 2009 Toyota Highlander Hybrid's starting point is a 3.3-liter V6 gasoline engine that cranks out 209 horsepower. It's matched to a pair of electric motors, one of which is primarily used as a starter/generator. Peak power for the gasoline-electric combo is a healthy 270 hp, and it's routed to the front wheels through a specialized continuously variable transmission (CVT).The Hybrid does have an AWD system in which a third electric motor is used to drive the rear wheels when extra traction or torque is needed. However, this setup differs significantly from the 4WD/all-wheel-drive system on the regular Highlander. There's no center differential, and the V6 engine never provides power to the rear wheels. As such, the Hybrid isn't really meant to go off-road, and even buyers shopping for a serious snow vehicle may not find it robust enough to meet their needs.In our tests, we managed to hustle the Highlander Hybrid to 60 mph in only 7.5 seconds. That's quick for any seven-passenger SUV, regardless of powertrain type. Fuel economy comes in at an EPA-rated 27 mpg city/25 mpg highway and 26 mpg in combined driving. City mileage is slightly higher than highway mileage because the Highlander relies more on the electric motors for propulsion at low speeds. The 2009 Highlander Hybrid comes standard with antilock disc brakes with brake assist, stability control, traction control, hill start assist, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags for all three seating rows, driver knee airbags and a back-up camera.In government crash testing, the Highlander Hybrid scored a perfect five stars for driver protection in frontal impacts, while front passenger protection garnered four stars. Side-impact protection earned another five stars for both front and rear occupants. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the Highlander Hybrid its highest score of \"Good\" for frontal-offset and side-impact protection. The 2009 Toyota Highlander Hybrid's ride is comfortable and hushed. Handling is competent and sure-footed but certainly not sporty. What is sporty, though, is the acceleration when the gas and electric motors are both laying down the power. In normal driving, the transition from electric to gasoline power is seamless. The Highlander Hybrid also feels relatively maneuverable, especially when compared with the competing Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid.In the interest of maximizing fuel economy, the driver can select either \"EV\" or \"Econ\" driving mode. In EV mode, the vehicle is motivated solely by electric power, but only at very low speeds for short distances. More useful is Econ mode, which restrains throttle response for the benefit of fuel economy. Switch it on in stop-and-go traffic and you'll never miss the extra power. The 2009 Toyota Highlander Hybrid's cabin is a pleasant place to be. We're particularly fond of the hideaway center seat in the second row. When you don't have a middle passenger in the second row, this seat stows in the back of the front console, and you can snap down a table with cupholders. Alternatively, you can leave this space open so older kids can access the optional third row without forcing you to move and reinstall any car seats that might be in the second-row outboard positions.The third-row bench can seat adults in a pinch, but it's certainly not as roomy as some third-row seats in other large crossovers. The Highlander's third row is also a one-piece fixed design, so you can't configure the cargo area for a storage and passenger mix. However, the seat does fold flat into the floor, allowing for 42 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row. With the second row folded down, the space opens up to a capacious 94 cubes. The Highlander Limited adds 19-inch alloy wheels, a power rear liftgate, an in-dash six-CD changer, satellite radio, leather seats, heated and power-adjustable front seats, and third-row seating for two more passengers. Many of these features are available as optional add-ons for the base model.Options for either trim level include dual-zone automatic climate control, rear automatic climate control and a separate rear air-conditioning unit. Further enhancements can be added to the Limited model and include a sunroof, a nine-speaker JBL sound system with Bluetooth, a voice-activated navigation system and a rear-seat entertainment system.",

    "full_description": "For 2011, the Toyota Camry sees no changes. The 2011 Toyota Camry isn't very exciting to drive, but it's a plush-riding champ on the highway and its optional V6 is superb. No wonder that the Camry remains one of the top family sedans on the market. Being a huge success, oddly  enough, can sometimes be rather unglamorous. Take the 2011 Toyota Camry, for  example. Car enthusiasts love to dismiss the Camry with snide remarks that relate  its excitement factor to that of a washing machine. But the reality is that for  every car guy (or gal) who requires entertainment from whatever they drive, there  are literally hundreds of folks who simply want their car to provide comfortable,  efficient and dependable transportation. The Camry has long excelled in this  area, and the result is Toyota's midsize sedan being one of the top-selling  cars for most of the last quarter-century.\nOf course there's more to the  Camry than just a bland persona. The Camry's engine choices include a  respectably powerful 2.5-liter inline-4 and an ultra-smooth 268-horsepower V6  that's without question the best in the family sedan segment. Other Camry  strong points include a commendable level of comfort, plenty of convenience and  luxury features, and top-notch safety scores. Whether you're using it for daily  commuting or a family road trip across the country, the Camry will likely  satisfy.\nThe midsize sedan segment is  arguably the most competitive in the automotive marketplace, and as such the  2011 Camry has a number of worthy opponents it must battle for sales chart  supremacy. Of course there is its age-old rival, the 2011 Honda Accord, but now you  can also consider the 2011  Chevrolet Malibu, 2011 Ford  Fusion, Hyundai Sonata, 2011  Mazda 6, 2011 Nissan  Altima and Suzuki Kizashi. Although the 2011 Toyota Camry doesn't handle  nearly as well as the sportier class entrants -- such as the 6 and Altima -- we  suspect the majority of shoppers won't care too much.\nSadly, the Camry's longstanding  sterling reputation for quality has been sullied by the most recent generation's  issue with recalls involving sticking gas pedals and potentially intrusive  floor mats. In fairness, we'd expect the 2011 versions to be free of those  flaws. And though the Camry still makes a strong case for itself, as stated  above, there are plenty of appealing options to choose from. The Camry is still  a solid choice, but it's no longer good enough to be a no-brainer. We strongly  suggest test-driving as many models as possible to see what best suits you. All Camrys are front-wheel drive, and the standard engine on base, LE and XLE trim levels is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that generates 169 hp. The SE receives a tweaked version of the same engine that's good for 179 hp. A six-speed manual transmission is standard on all four-cylinder Camrys except for the XLE, which comes only with a six-speed automatic. For the rest of the trims, the automatic is optional. Fuel economy is estimated to be 22 mpg city/33 mpg highway and 26 mpg combined with the manual, while the automatic drops highway mileage slightly to 32 mpg.Optional on all models except for the base Camry is a 3.5-liter V6 that cranks out 268 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed automatic is the sole transmission choice. Thus equipped, the Camry can sprint to 60 mph in a fleet 6.5 seconds, yet fuel economy remains impressive at19/28/23 mpg. Every 2011 Toyota Camry comes with antilock brakes with brake assist, stability control, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and a driver knee airbag.\nIn the government's new, more strenuous crash testing for 2011, the Camry earned an overall rating of three stars out of a possible five, with three stars for overall frontal crash protection and three stars for overall side crash protection.The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave it the top rating of \"Good\" in its frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. The Camry's tried-and-true formula is to provide excellent ride comfort and isolation at the expense of engaging driving dynamics. The SE supposedly ratchets up the fun in tight corners, but in reality it's just a slightly firmer version of one of the most softly sprung and least involving family sedans you can buy. Even so, the Camry's cosseting suspension may be preferable to the firmer, sportier approach taken by Mazda and Nissan.There is one unequivocally sporty element -- the optional turbine-smooth V6, which transforms the 2011 Toyota Camry into one of the fastest mid-priced sedans on the road while maintaining impressive fuel economy numbers. The four-cylinder isn't as zippy, but its performance and economy are still very good for a midsize sedan. In base and LE models, the Camry's interior is straightforward and functional. Toyota's decades of experience in ergonomics shines through here -- the main controls are large and logically placed, and the wide seats easily accommodate most body types. There are plenty of storage cubbies, too. The ice-blue backlighting for the audio and climate controls may seem a bit tacky, but it does liven things up a bit. The SE adds sporty interior styling cues, while the XLE raises the bar with convincing fake wood accents and an upscale feature not typically seen in this segment -- reclining rear seats. Trunk capacity for all models is 15 cubic feet.Notably, build and materials quality aren't up to the high standard set by previous-generation Camrys. Some plastics are substandard, and panel fitments aren't uniformly precise. The Camry's interior isn't bad by any means, but it's no longer above average for this segment. The base Camry features 16-inch steel wheels, air-conditioning, auto up/down windows for all four doors, a six-speaker CD audio system with an auxiliary input jack, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, cruise control, full power accessories and a 60/40-split-folding rear seat. The Camry LE adds keyless entry and an eight-way power driver seat.The SE includes a sport-tuned suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels and special interior and exterior styling details. The luxurious XLE reverts to the LE's softer suspension settings and 16-inch wheels while providing an upgraded JBL-branded sound system with an in-dash CD changer and satellite radio, Bluetooth phone and music connectivity, automatic dual-zone climate control, a power passenger seat, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, reclining rear seats, a moonroof, wood-tone accents and, on the V6 model, leather seating. Note that neither the SE nor the XLE offers the folding rear seat, though each has a center pass-through.Most of the XLE's upgrades are offered on the lower trim levels as options. Other major options, depending on trim level, include a sunroof, a navigation system, keyless ignition and entry and heated front seats.",

    "full_description": "Front-seat side airbags and two-row side curtain airbags are standard on every 2007 Toyota RAV4. Additionally, the optional JBL audio system now comes with steering-wheel-mounted controls and Bluetooth connectivity. Spacious, comfortable and easy to drive, the 2007 Toyota RAV4 is a strong choice among compact SUVs, especially if you want a V6 or a kid-size third-row seat. Toyota's RAV4 owns the distinction of being the first bite-size sport-utility vehicle. The RAV4 debuted in 1996 when most SUVs were still unwieldy, body-on-frame beasts. In contrast, the car-based Toyota was small and easy to drive. That it was shaped like a jelly bean hardly seemed to matter. With plenty of sales success behind it, it gave rise to a whole new segment of vehicles often called mini-utes or cute-utes.\nLike its modern-day competitors, the 2007 Toyota RAV4 isn't so mini anymore. It's still manageably sized and practical for city use, but now there's room for a V6 engine and a third-row seat -- features that would have been unimaginable in the original. During its last redesign in 2006, the vehicle saw the most dramatic changes of its decade-long history. Not only did this give Toyota's compact SUV a more substantial, less toy-like look on the outside, it opened up 4 more inches of legroom in the second row and 8 more cubic feet of luggage space.\nThe previous-generation RAV4's 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine carried over and continues to provide adequate motivation for what's now a 3,400-pound vehicle. However, in an effort to attract power-hungry buyers with more flexible budgets, Toyota also slotted a new 3.5-liter V6 into the lineup. The V6 is good for an amazing 269 horsepower and still gives the four-wheel-drive RAV4 a 21/28 mpg rating.\nEven with its heftier size, the current RAV4 continues to provide the sharp handling dynamics that made earlier models so popular. While the Mazda CX-7 surpasses it in this regard, the Toyota is still one of the most entertaining SUVs available for less than $30,000. It's also an excellent, all-around choice for singles, couples and young families shopping for a versatile utility vehicle. Other candidates you may want to consider, along with the CX-7, include the Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Santa Fe and Mitsubishi Outlander. Of this group, the Honda is the most refined, while the larger Hyundai offers a true midsize-SUV experience for a compact price. The Mitsubishi is the closest match in size and amenities, but even with its new V6, it's not as quick as the RAV4.\nIn fact, no SUV in this price range can match the straight-line performance of the V6-equipped 2007 Toyota RAV4 -- an advantage that will continue to set this well-rounded compact SUV apart from competitors more focused on utility than fun. A 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine is standard on all trim levels, and it delivers 166 hp and 165 pound-feet of torque. A 3.5-liter V6, which boasts 269 hp and 246 lb-ft of torque, is optional across the board. Automatic transmissions are standard -- the four-cylinder gets paired with a four-speed automatic, while the V6 gets a five-speed unit. All versions of the Toyota RAV4 are available with either front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive (4WD). Front-drive models have a limited-slip differential. The electronic 4WD system sends most of the power to the front wheels until it identifies potential slippage. It also has a \"4WD lock\" mode that fixes the front/rear power split at 50/50, which is useful for driving in snow. Fuel economy is impressive, as all models have an EPA combined mpg rating in the mid 20s. Towing preparation is available on V6-equipped RAV4s, and thusly equipped, the compact sport-ute can pull up to 3,500 pounds. Antilock disc brakes, stability control, traction control, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags are standard on every 2007 Toyota RAV4. Vehicles equipped with the V6 and/or the optional third-row seat also come with hill-start assist and downhill assist control. In NHTSA crash tests, the RAV4 earned a perfect five stars for driver protection in frontal impacts and four stars for the front passenger. It earned five stars for front- and rear-occupant protection in side impacts. Toyota's small SUV performed extremely well in IIHS tests as well, earning the top rating of \"Good\" in both the frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. Intended for a life on pavement, the 2007 Toyota RAV4 really shines in this environment. Its taut suspension and quick steering make daily errands much more enjoyable than they would be in most SUVs. It's not as athletic as the CX-7, but in trade, the Toyota offers a smooth ride that's forgiving enough for commuters who drive on crumbling expressways. Road noise can be an issue at times, but wind noise is well controlled. The four-cylinder engine is a reasonable choice for most buyers, as it provides adequate power for day-to-day driving. The optional 269-hp V6, meanwhile, is full of swagger. So equipped, the RAV4 can embarrass quite a few modern sport coupes in terms of acceleration.Read our Toyota RAV4 Long-Term 20,000-Mile Test Inside, the RAV4 has a clean design with large, simple controls and lots of storage space. The cabin isn't as plasticky as previous-generation RAV4s, but it still has a budget feel compared to competitors like the CR-V and Santa Fe. Nevertheless, the Toyota offers a highly practical design. The rear seats recline, and can slide forward or rearward 6.5 inches to optimize passenger space or cargo capacity. Normal seating capacity is five; the optional third-row seat bumps it to seven, though this seat is truly meant only for children. To configure the RAV4 for cargo, all one has to do is flip a lever to instantly get a flat load floor -- no need to remove headrests or fold up seat cushions. With its flat load floor, the RAV4 can hold a maximum of 73 cubic feet of cargo. The load floor is also quite low for this class, and minimizes the strain of loading a week's worth of groceries. The Toyota's side-hinged tailgate can be an inconvenience when you're parked on the street, though, as it opens away from the curb. A third-row seat is optional on all trim levels, while Sport and Limited models can be equipped with a nine-speaker JBL sound system (with Bluetooth capability built in) and a moonroof. Heated leather seats and a DVD-based rear entertainment system are exclusive options for the Limited.",

    "full_description": "The 2018 Toyota Highlander Hybrid receives no significant changes. The  name pretty much says it all. The 2018 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is simply a  more fuel-efficient version of the standard, three-row Highlander. We like the  Highlander, so it's certainly a compliment.  Like  the standard Highlander, the Hybrid is a relatively spacious, quiet and  comfortable crossover. It also comes with a lot of standard equipment,  including the latest in advanced driver safety aids. The big difference is the  Hybrid's powertrain. It combines a gasoline V6 and electric motors for a total  of 306 horsepower and 29 mpg combined.Toyota  continues to be the only non-luxury automaker to offer a three-row midsize  hybrid crossover. If high fuel economy and utility are priorities, the  Highlander Hybrid is the obvious pick. Just note that the Hybrid costs more. If  you're buying one new, it's going to take you a few years to recoup the cost  (compared to a regular Highlander) in fuel savings alone. The name pretty much says it all. The 2018 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is simply a more fuel-efficient version of the standard, three-row Highlander. We like the Highlander, so it's certainly a compliment. The Highlander Hybrid's powerful V6 engine and electric motors, in combination, move it off the line quickly. It's not as quick as the regular Highlander, but acceleration is acceptable. Despite a vague-feeling pedal, the Highlander provides sufficient emergency braking effectiveness and good fade resistance. In daily situations, pedal engagement can sometimes feel awkward. The Highlander's steering is reassuring when cornering and provides straight-line stability on the highway. But the steering of other, albeit non-hybrid, SUVs instills more confidence and provides more engagement to the driver. It's a confident and competent handler, right up to the relatively low limit set by the electronic stability system that really lets you know when you're asking too much of it. Again, others are sharper, but most drivers will find it to be acceptable. This is an easy SUV to drive, even if it can feel a tad large compared to certain non-hybrid competitors. As far as hybrids go, though, the brakes aren't weird, and there aren't any strange sensations that will make you feel as if you're driving a science experiment. There are no low-range gears, and it doesn't have a traditional all-wheel-drive system (the rear wheels are simply powered by a separate electric motor). But its 8 inches of ground clearance, hill hold and hill descent systems, and advantageous approach and departure angles are admirable. The heated leather front seats (XLE and above) are as comfy as furniture and offer tons of adjustment, including extendable thigh support. The second row is firmer but slides and reclines in a wide range. The third row is merely acceptable; some other crossovers have roomier third-row seating. One of the Highlander's best qualities is its ride comfort. The suspension easily absorbs bumps and ruts without feeling like a floating barge. Very few, if any, road irregularities intrude. It's one of the quietest SUVs we've ever measured. An occasional wisp of wind noise is evident on a gusty highway pass. At full throttle, the engine's drone does find its way into the cabin. Some controls, specifically those for the audio system, are located too far away. Otherwise, Toyota's typical array of controls are easy to use. It can be difficult to reach the third row because the second row (be it the captain's chairs or bench) doesn't get out of the way enough to provide the sort of access found in certain competitors. The doors are large, though, and the seats are of a reasonable height. Abundant seat adjustments, including power thigh support (a rare feature) on most trim levels. Sufficient seat and telescoping-wheel travel for taller drivers. As in its competitors, the first and second rows provide copious room for most occupants. The third row is squishier than those in some rival models, and despite have three seat belts, only small kids are likely to fit three abreast back there. The quality of materials is among the class best, and during our one-year long-term test of a Highlander, everything in the cabin remained nicely screwed together. Impressive. There's a unique built-in shelf on the dashboard that serves as a resting place for phones or other personal items, though it can be hard to get your hand in there. A vast amount of space is found under the sliding armrest cover \u2014 it's big enough to store a laptop or a sizable purse. The Highlander offers an average amount of cargo capacity for the segment regardless of how many rows are in place. Some others offer more space behind the third row, notably the Ford Explorer. A properly equipped Highlander Hybrid Limited can tow up to 3,500 pounds, compared to 5,000 pounds for the conventional gasoline Highlander and most competitors. Toyota's touchscreen infotainment interfaces aren't the flashiest or feature-packed, but they are easy to use. The Highlander's 8-inch screen (an upgrade) is notably quick to respond to inputs and features large, easily pressed icons. Every Highlander comes standard with forward collision warning and automatic braking (includes pedestrian detection), adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and steering assist. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are optional. The 2018 Toyota Highlander Hybrid  comes with a good amount of standard equipment in the base LE trim. But we  recommend upgrading to the midlevel XLE.  On top of the standard systems such as forward collision mitigation and lane  departure intervention, the XLE gets blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert as well as the upgraded 8.1-inch touchscreen. Every  Highlander Hybrid comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with three  electric motors. Total system output is 306 horsepower, and all-wheel drive is  standard.Starting  things off is the LE, which has  18-inch wheels, a windshield wiper de-icer, forward collision warning with  automatic emergency braking, lane departure intervention, adaptive cruise  control, keyless entry and ignition, a rearview camera, tri-zone automatic  climate control, a height-adjustable driver seat, Bluetooth, a 6.1-inch  touchscreen and a six-speaker sound system. Our  trim level choice for the Highlander Hybrid is the XLE. You get the LE's equipment plus a sunroof, a height-adjustable power liftgate, a flip-up rear  window, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems, power front  seats with heating, leather upholstery, second-row sunshades, upgraded interior  materials, a second-row 120-volt power outlet, an 8.1-inch touchscreen,  satellite and HD radio, and a navigation system. If  you want more, there's the Limited with  19-inch wheels, LED running lights, rear parking sensors, heated and ventilated  front seats with perforated leather, driver-seat memory functions, second-row  captain's chairs, a rear cargo cover and a 12-speaker JBL sound system. At the  top of the range is the Limited Platinumwith a panoramic sunroof, automatic  wipers, front parking sensors, a 360-degree parking camera system, heated rear  outboard seats and a heated steering wheel.The  XLE and Limited can be equipped with a rear-seat entertainment system.",

    "full_description": "For 2011, the Toyota Avalon receives new front- and rear-end styling, a new dash and more standard features. Furthermore, trim levels have been reduced to the base Avalon (which is similar to the outgoing XLS trim) and the Avalon Limited. Its price of entry may be higher than those of its rivals, but if you're looking for a refined, well-built full-size sedan in the $30,000 price bracket, the 2011 Toyota Avalon is a top-notch choice. The full-size sedan used to be the exclusive domain of American  carmakers. Popular with families, they provided plenty of space and comfort for  passengers and had trunks the size of a New York apartment. Current full-sizers  may not be as massive as they were, but they're much more space-efficient so  they offer nearly as much room for people and things. A good example of this is  the 2011 Toyota Avalon.\nThe latest Avalon is known for its  spacious interior, abundant luxury features and refined ride. Although this  year's model brings a refresh with some new styling (front/rear ends and  instrument panel), more standard features and a reduction in trim levels from  three to two, the 2011 Avalon is otherwise similar to the one that debuted six  years ago. That's fine with us, as there is so much to recommend the Avalon.  Though its exterior looks smaller than most of its rivals, the Avalon manages  to offer more space within the cabin. Meanwhile, the backseat is among the most  accommodating anywhere, with standard reclining seatbacks, abundant headroom  and an available power rear sunshade.\nAnd then there is the car's  remarkable combination of performance and fuel efficiency. The standard  268-horsepower V6 engine accelerates the Avalon more rapidly than similarly  powered competitors while still returning impressive fuel mileage estimates of  20 mpg city and 29 mpg highway.\nUnlike in years past, however, the  Avalon now faces more competent rivals like the 2011 Buick LaCrosse and 2011 Ford Taurus. And even  with this year's styling tweaks, the Avalon may look a bit too bland for some  buyers. A past gripe involving the Avalon's pricing has been partially  addressed this year as the base model comes more generously equipped but with  no increase in price. Still, some budget-minded buyers may wish there was a  more basic, lower-priced model. While the 2011 Toyota Avalon remains at the top  of its game and is easy to recommend, it does have some worthy competition that's  worth consideration. The front-wheel-drive 2011 Toyota Avalon is motivated by a 3.5-liter V6 rated at 268 hp and 248 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard. The EPA's fuel mileage estimates for the Avalon stand at 20 mpg city and 29 mpg highway, making it one of the most fuel-efficient full-size sedans available. Standard safety equipment on the 2011 Toyota Avalon includes antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, active front head restraints, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and a driver-side knee airbag.In government crash tests, the Toyota Avalon earned a perfect five stars in all frontal- and side-impact categories. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Avalon earned the top score of \"Good\" for its protection of occupants in frontal-offset and side-impact crashes. Not surprisingly, the 2011 Toyota Avalon is at its best on the open highway. The cabin remains quiet, the ultra-smooth V6 engine has plenty of passing power and the suspension swallows up road imperfections without drama. The Avalon is no athlete, though, so those interested in a slightly more involved driving experience should consider the Buick LaCrosse. The Avalon's steering is too light to feel sporty, but it responds to driver inputs in a precise, fluid manner. Additionally, a tidy turning circle makes the Avalon feel unexpectedly maneuverable on tight city streets. The Toyota Avalon's interior feels upscale and inviting thanks to its glowing gauges, attractive and ergonomic control layout and high-quality materials. This year's redesigned dash and center stack, along with standard wood and metallic accents further the luxury ambience, making the Avalon impressively similar to its upscale cousins from Lexus.The front seats are wide and accommodating, and with the Limited you also get heated and ventilated seats with a seat-cushion length adjuster. The rear seats are very comfortable as well. Legroom is abundant even by full-size sedan standards, and the rear seats boast a manually reclining back that allows passengers to stretch out on long trips. A 6-footer can sit in back with more than enough knee- and headroom, and with a nearly flat floor, getting three into the backseat on carpool day is no problem.One minor annoyance is the inability to fold the rear seats (the trade-off for the reclining feature). The trunk measures 14.4 cubic feet, smaller than what's available in other full-size sedans. The Limited adds xenon headlights, automatic wipers, keyless ignition/entry, additional power driver seat adjustment, a power passenger seat, heated and ventilated front seats, driver memory functions, a power rear sunshade and a more powerful audio system with 12 speakers. A few of the Limited's features, such as the upgraded audio system and heated seats, are available on the base Avalon, while a voice-activated touchscreen navigation system with traffic reporting is optional for both trims.",

    "full_description": "The lineup of Toyota Tundra pickups has been streamlined to include fewer configurations for 2011, while the base V6 gains variable valve timing and some 34 horsepower to go with it. Trailer sway control is now standard on all Tundras. Even though its rivals have all received makeovers recently, the 2011 Toyota Tundra's strong powertrains, spacious cabs and excellent towing ability make it a top choice for a workhorse pickup. The 2011 Toyota Tundra practically screams \"one tough  truck.\" After all, it's built in Texas, named after an Arctic biome where  only moss can grow, and sold by a company renowned for dependable vehicles.  This perception isn't merely lip service, as this full-size pickup has proven it  has the guts to stand up to the established American players in the pickup  segment in many of the tests Edmunds has conducted over the years.\nLast year the Tundra got even tougher when its midgrade V8  was replaced with a more robust 4.6-liter mill that offered not only substantially  more horsepower but also better fuel economy. With this addition, getting the  top-shelf 5.7-liter V8 is no longer a must for a prospective Tundra buyer --  though it's certainly a nice luxury to have, especially if heavy towing is frequently  in order. On the opposite end of the powertrain lineup, Toyota has upgraded the  base V6 engine for 2011 with variable valve timing and an additional 34 horses.  The resulting 270 hp still isn't enough to outdo the base engines in the Chevy  Silverado and Ford F-150, though fuel economy is pretty good.\nBeyond its powertrains, the Toyota Tundra stands out thanks  to its passenger-friendly cabins. The extended Double Cab features traditional  front-hinged doors, making day-to-day usability easier than Chevy and Ford  trucks with the more traditional reverse-opening access doors. The Tundra  CrewMax, meanwhile, is truly enormous, featuring class-leading legroom and a  rear seat that not only slides but reclines as well. Apart from the Tundra's  sometimes jiggly, over-sprung ride quality, the CrewMax could easily pull  double-duty as a ranch limo.\nThe Tundra is getting on in years now, and the newer  2011 Ram  1500 and 2011Ford  F-150 have surpassed it in a number of areas. In particular, the  Ram's coil-spring rear suspension gives it a relatively luxurious ride, while  the Ford's new engine lineup and many innovative features make it the cutting-edge  choice among pickup trucks. But the 2011 Toyota Tundra continues to be one  tough truck -- especially for towing -- and it has set the standard that Detroit's  offerings are hoping to meet. The 2011 Toyota Tundra is available with rear-wheel or four-wheel  drive. The rear-drive regular and double cabs come standard with a 4.0-liter V6  that produces 270 hp and 278 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed automatic  transmission is standard. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 16 mpg city/20 mpg  highway and 18 mpg in highway driving.\nOptional on rear-drive regular and double cabs, and standard  on long-bed, CrewMax or 4WD models is a 4.6-liter V8 that produces 310 hp and  327 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed automatic is standard. In Edmunds testing, a  base 4WD Tundra with this engine went from zero to 60 mph in 7.9 seconds. EPA-estimated  fuel economy is 14/19/16 with 4WD.\nStandard on the Limited and optional on all other Tundras is  a 5.7-liter V8 that produces 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed  automatic is standard. A 4WD Tundra CrewMax with this engine went from zero to  60 mph in 6.9 seconds in Edmunds testing. EPA-estimated fuel economy is  14/18/16 with 4x2 and 13/17/14 with 4x4. The Tundra's maximum tow rating with  the 5.7-liter V8 and the optional tow package is 10,400 pounds. Every Toyota Tundra comes standard with antilock brakes  (with brake assist), stability and traction control, trailer sway control,  front side airbags, side curtain airbags and front knee airbags. In Edmunds  brake testing, a Double Cab 4.6 came to a stop from 60 mph in 134 feet -- a  good distance for a full-size truck.\nThe Tundra has not been rated using the government's new,  more strenuous 2011 crash testing procedure. Its 2010 rating (which isn't  comparable to the new 2011 tests) of the regular cab was four out of five stars  for driver protection and five stars for the front passenger. The driver rating  went up to five stars with the Double Cab and CrewMax. The Insurance Institute  for Highway Safety gave the Tundra its highest rating of \"Good\" in  the frontal-offset and side impact tests. When the Tundra was first introduced, any model that carried  an engine other than the 5.7-liter V8 was a letdown. However, last year's  introduction of the 310-hp 4.6-liter V8 means playing second fiddle isn't  necessarily a bad thing. This engine provides all the muscle most truck buyers  need, with better fuel economy to boot. This year's horsepower bump for the  base V6 is certainly welcome, but V8 grunt seems like a must in this class. And  if getting the most V8 grunt is important, the 5.7 isn't the class leader it  once was in terms of horsepower, but it remains a champ for towing thanks to its  axle ratio and a well-sorted six-speed automatic.\nFor daily use, the 2011 Toyota Tundra's light steering makes  the truck very easy to drive, though at times it feels bigger than competing  trucks. We were satisfied with the Tundra's ride quality a few years ago, but  the new Dodge Ram's rear coil spring suspension and the Ford F-150's sturdier  frame make the Tundra's ride seem stiff-legged by comparison. The 2011 Toyota Tundra's interior has not seen a refresh  since this current generation debuted in 2007. In the face of redesigned Dodge  and Ford trucks, it just isn't as appealing as it once was. Specific complaints  include audio controls that are out of comfortable reach for the driver, gauges  that are hard to read and interior materials that now trail the competition in  terms of quality. The new Platinum package addresses some of these  deficiencies, but for most drivers, the regular interior treatment should  suffice.\nThe regular cab offers comfortable seats as well as a  generous amount of interior cargo space. In Double Cabs, the backseat is fully  usable for adults and its traditional front-hinged doors are much easier to  live with than the rear-hinged clamshell doors of its competitors. The CrewMax,  meanwhile, offers the roomiest rear seat of any pickup truck with a limolike  44.5 inches of rear legroom and a reclining seatback. \nStandard equipment on the base Tundra includes 18-inch steel  wheels, a damped tailgate, dual-zone air-conditioning, 40/20/40 split bench  seat, a tilt steering wheel and a four-speaker sound system with a CD player  and an auxiliary audio jack. The Double Cab adds keyless entry, full power  accessories, intermittent windshield wipers, cruise control, an eight-way  adjustable driver seat and six speakers. All but the speakers are optional on  the regular cab as part of the SR5 package. The CrewMax gains a vertical  sliding rear window and a sliding/reclining rear seat.\nOptions on the base Tundras include 18-inch alloy wheels, foglamps,  heated mirrors, a bed tie-down system and front bucket seats with a center  console and a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel. Also available is an  upgraded stereo with satellite radio, an iPod/USB audio interface and Bluetooth  phone and audio connectivity, while a JBL version of that stereo is also  available with 12 speakers in the CrewMax and 10 speakers in the Double Cab.\nThese items are all included on the Tundra Limited, which is  offered as a Double Cab or CrewMax only. The Limited also gets auto-dimming and  power-folding exterior mirrors, upgraded gauges, automatic dual-zone climate  control, leather upholstery and front seat adjustable lumbar.\nTow mirrors, a navigation system and a rearview camera are  optional on all trims. The CrewMax can be equipped with a rear seat  entertainment system, a sunroof and on the Limited, a Platinum package that  adds driver memory functions (optional separately), heated and ventilated front  seats, wood trim, auto up/down front windows and the navigation system. The TRD  Sport package available on base Double Cab models includes 20-inch wheels,  color-keyed bumpers, black cloth interior and special badging. The TRD Rock  Warrior package available on base Double Cab and CrewMax models includes  17-inch alloy wheels, off-road tires, Bilstein shocks and the Sport package's  styling flourishes. The TRD Off-Road package goes one step further with skid  plates and front tow hooks.\nFinally, a Work Truck package strips the base regular and double  cabs of much of their accoutrements and substitutes black bumpers, vinyl  upholstery and rubber flooring.",

    "full_description": "The 2014 Toyota Camry Hybrid is largely unchanged. Midway through the model year, Toyota introduced a \"2014.5\" Camry Hybrid. Highlights of this midyear update include a new SE Limited Edition trim level, a newly standard rearview camera and a revised naming of the car's infotainment systems. The 2014 Toyota Camry Hybrid doesn't have the top fuel economy numbers in its class, and in certain areas it lacks refinement, but it's still a good choice for a hybrid family sedan thanks to its smooth ride, accommodating interior and strong performance. Given the popularity of the Prius model line, it's easy to forget that Toyota makes other hybrid vehicles, too. That would be a shame, though, because the 2014 Toyota Camry Hybrid has the same refined powertrain characteristics and small appetite for fuel, along with the added space and comfort of the traditional Camry sedan.\nThe sedan body style is a plus for consumers who prefer the Camry Hybrid's more formal look over the Prius' hatchback body style. But Toyota's hybrid family sedan also has something you might not expect -- energetic acceleration. With a 0-60-mph time of 7.4 seconds, the Toyota Camry Hybrid is downright quick for a four-cylinder midsize sedan, let alone one that also puts up an impressive EPA combined rating of 41 mpg.\nLike other Camrys, the hybrid also boasts comfortable seating front and rear, good outward visibility and an ideal balance between a smooth, quiet ride and responsive handling. The Toyota's downsides include steering that offers little feedback, some odd design elements and subpar trim within the cabin and an occasionally finicky touchscreen with a complicated setup process for smartphone integration. The Camry Hybrid also comes up a little short in the mpg bragging rights department, as the LE's 41 mpg EPA-rated combined fuel economy trails the mpg ratings of some rivals. \nCompared to the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, the Toyota offers a smoother-operating hybrid system and better fuel economy. There's also the Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid, which offers a sportier drive but far less interior room. The 2014 Ford Fusion Hybrid and the new 2014 Honda Accord Hybrid beat the Camry Hybrid in both fuel economy and driving enjoyment, and our staff picked them over the Toyota in a comparison test. But overall, the 2014 Camry Hybrid still merits consideration from shoppers looking for a comfortable gas-sipping family car. The 2014 Toyota Camry Hybrid pairs a 156-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and battery pack. At low speeds, the car can be propelled solely by the electric motor, which is why the Camry Hybrid is so fuel-efficient in city driving. Working together, the two power sources crank out a combined output of 200 hp. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) delivers power to the front wheels.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, a Camry Hybrid XLE accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds, a quick time for a hybrid midsize sedan.\nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the Camry Hybrid LE is 41 mpg combined (43 mpg city/39 mpg highway). Interestingly, the XLE achieves 40 mpg combined (40 mpg city/38 mpg highway), likely due to the increased rolling resistance of its larger wheels and tires. The 2014 Toyota Camry Hybrid comes with antilock brakes, stability and traction control, a rearview camera, front- and rear-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags, and knee airbags for both driver and passenger. A blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alerts is available on the XLE, as is the optional Safety Connect telematics system that includes roadside assistance, stolen vehicle location and automatic collision notification.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Camry Hybrid came to a stop from 60 mph in 122 feet, an average result.\nIn government crash testing, the non-hybrid Toyota Camry received a top five-star score for overall crash protection, with four stars for overall frontal protection and five stars for overall side protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Camry the best possible rating of \"Good\" in its moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and roof strength tests. The car scored a \"Poor\" (the worst rating) in that agency's \"small overlap\" frontal-impact crash test but a \"Good\" for its head restraints/seatbelts for whiplash protection in rear impacts. The 2014 Toyota Camry Hybrid is, for the most part, dynamically well-rounded. Thanks to careful suspension tuning, it grips the road well and the ride is mostly undisturbed by bumps and ruts. Most drivers will find the steering precise, but if you're more demanding, you might be annoyed by its lack of feel. In that case we'd steer you toward the Fusion Hybrid, which has crisper, more direct steering. \nThat said, Toyota's hybrid drivetrain remains the most sophisticated and refined system on the market. The transition from all-electric mode to the gasoline engine is less noticeable in the Camry Hybrid than in the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, for example. All the while, acceleration is strong for a midsize, non-premium-brand hybrid sedan. The car's brake pedal feel is more natural than in most rivals, mainly because Toyota has managed to make the transitions between the hybrid regenerative braking system and the car's conventional brakes far less obvious to the driver in normal traffic situations.  The interior of the 2014 Toyota Camry Hybrid feels roomy, and its thin front roof pillars provide good outward visibility from the driver seat. Drivers over 6 feet tall, however, may find that the seat doesn't go low enough to ensure an optimal driving position. The cabin's design lacks cohesiveness, and although build quality is solid, some plastic trim looks a bit cheap compared to rivals' more luxurious materials. The spacious rear seat is enhanced by a nicely reclined seatback angle that makes it easy to sit back there on long trips. Along with the Honda Accord, the Camry is tops in the midsize sedan class for backseat comfort.\nThe Camry Hybrid's upgraded audio system includes Entune, a suite of smartphone-connected services that includes features like the Bing search engine, Pandora streaming radio, traffic updates and sports and stock information. Getting started with the smartphone integration system can be a hassle, though, since you have to install an app on your phone and register for an account, plus you always need an active data connection to use Entune's functions. The touchscreen interface has straightforward menus, but it's sometimes unresponsive to user touch.\nWith 13.1 cubic feet, the trunk offers respectable capacity for a hybrid sedan (hybrids typically sacrifice some space to their under-floor battery packs). \nThe 2014 LE features 16-inch steel wheels, automatic headlights, keyless ignition/entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, full power accessories, cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a trip computer, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a 6.1-inch display and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, an auxiliary input and a USB/iPod interface.\nThe 2014 XLE adds 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, heated exterior mirrors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar), an auto-dimming rearview mirror and rear seat air vents.\nAdditional options are available for the XLE but can vary depending on the region of the country in which you live. These include a sunroof, a rearview camera, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a four-way power passenger seat, Entune smartphone integration (includes Bing search engine, Internet radio, concierge services and traffic, sports and stock information), blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alerts, the Safety Connect telematics system, a premium 10-speaker JBL audio system and a navigation system (includes a larger 7-inch touchscreen display, the Entune system, satellite radio and HD radio).\nFor the 2014.5 Camry Hybrid, there's also a SE Limited Edition trim level. It's equipped similarly to the XLE but has sporty styling cues and the sport front seats of the non-hybrid Camry SE. A rearview camera is standard on all 2014.5 trims. Additionally, Toyota renamed the audio and infotainment systems for these 2014.5 Camrys. The Camry Hybrid LE's unchanged audio system is called Entune Audio while the XLE's system is dubbed Entune Audio Plus, and compared to the '14 model adds satellite radio, HD radio and traffic/weather reporting. Optional on the SE Limited Edition and XLE is Entune Premium Audio with Navigation and App Suite. The latter adds the navigation system and smartphone app integration (featuring Bing, OpenTable and Pandora). On top of that, one may also opt for the 10-speaker JBL sound system.",

    "full_description": "If you keep score of your green points  and absolutely love to talk about your car to total strangers, the 2020 Toyota  Mirai should be on your short list. A hydrogen-powered electric vehicle, the  Mirai is sort of a rolling science experiment that you can buy \u2014  provided you live in the states of California or Hawaii. Those are the only  states with enough of a hydrogen fueling infrastructure to keep you rolling. \nAll of the Mirai's futuristic technology  is wrapped in styling that's, well, unusual-looking. But the driving experience  is one that electric car owners will be familiar with. It's not fast, but it is  smooth and plenty comfortable even after hours of rush-hour traffic. \nNot a lot of other manufacturers are  tackling fuel cell vehicles on this scale. Honda's Clarity sedan is the Mirai's  closest competitor. Hyundai, for its part, has recently introduced its Nexo  SUV. Compared to the Mirai and Clarity, the Nexo offers a longer range and more  traditional styling both inside and out. It's also worth knowing that Toyota is  introducing an all-new Mirai for the 2021 model year that's sleeker-looking and  promises more than 400 miles of range.\nWhat's it like to live with?\nTo  learn more about the Toyota Mirai of this generation, read about our  experiences from six months of living with a 2016 Toyota Mirai. We cover  everything from seat comfort to real-world fuel economy, especially important  given the Mirai's hydrogen fuel cell powertrain. Is a fuel cell vehicle worth  the expense and inconvenience? Read through our Toyota Mirai long-term  test to see what we think. Your  paint color is the only thing you'll need to decide on when it comes to buying  the Mirai since no trims or options  are available. How does the Mirai drive? There's nothing wrong with the way the Mirai drives if you stay within the confines of its green-car mission. There's acceleration off the line, and its electric propulsion system is as smooth as blended yogurt. But it never quite feels speedy. In our testing, our Mirai test car accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 8.8 seconds, which is slower than most battery-powered EVs by at least a second. \n\n   Around turns, the Mirai can feel overweight and under-tired. It generally goes where it's pointed without delay, but it lacks the feedback that lets you know exactly how much to turn the wheel to carve the intended path. How comfortable is the Mirai? Reminiscent of an older Toyota Avalon, the Mirai has comfy seats and delivers a reasonably smooth ride. Most of the time it's a quiet place to pass the miles \u2014 the exception are a few odd and fairly unobtrusive background noises from the fuel cell. Tire and wind noise is present in small amounts that most people won't notice.\n\n   The ride quality is mostly smooth but can get a little bouncy when driving over bigger bumps. We'd expect a little more polish at this asking price. How\u2019s the interior? At first the Mirai seems as spacious as a Toyota Camry or Avalon, but it is narrower. The gauges and climate controls have been designed to reinforce the Mirai's futuristic image, but that comes at the expense of ease of use. Thankfully, it's easy to get in and out. The story is much the same for the backseat passengers, but the roof does slope down a little more back there. As for visibility, it's pretty easy to see out of the Mirai thanks to the slender roof pillars and large windows. How\u2019s the tech? The touchscreen system is easy to use. But the touch-sensitive climate temperature sliders and Prius-like central gauges are questionable. Toyota includes automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist with the Mirai. Blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert is nice to have. How\u2019s the storage? The trunk is moderately sized, but the rear seats do not fold down and there is no pass-through to the trunk. What you see is all you get since the fuel cell system limits trunk space and console storage. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA says you can expect to drive about 66 miles per kilogram of hydrogen used. The Mirai's range is about 300 miles, which is less than the Hyundai Nexo's. But as with all hydrogen-fueled vehicles, filling up can be comparatively expensive compared to regular gasoline or battery electric cars. Is the Mirai a good value? Do not buy a Mirai to save money. The car itself is expensive to buy as well as to drive on a per-mile basis. And it's going to be a hassle to find fuel. As such, Toyota will only sell one to select individuals in specific geographic areas. The Mirai drives pleasantly enough, and this car is a conversation starter. We hope you like to talk about your car with strangers. It's a must-have car for those who want to score the most green points.",

    "full_description": "Toyota's midsize SUV is fully redesigned for 2008. Significantly larger than the original, the 2008 Highlander features a standard V6 engine and a habitable third-row seat. With more room, more power and more conveniences than its predecessor, the redesigned 2008 Toyota Highlander is truly optimized for family use. If you're shopping for a midsize crossover SUV this year, make sure you try this Toyota. At the dawn of the 21st century, while other automotive manufacturers were reveling in the profitability of sport-utility vehicles, Toyota was looking ahead. The company foresaw a day when consumers would no longer have patience for the poor fuel economy and sloppy handling of traditional SUVs and would instead turn to more refined vehicles that offered SUV-like convenience combined with a carlike driving demeanor. That kind of thinking resulted in the original Toyota Highlander. Not only was it an immediate hit with families, it served as the template for many of the rival midsize crossover SUVs that followed it. After seven years, though, the Highlander had begun to show its age, particularly in the cabin, which was cramped by current class standards. Accordingly, the 2008 Toyota Highlander benefits from a top-to-bottom redesign.The first thing you'll notice about the second-generation Highlander is its increased size. Built on the same platform as the current-generation Camry, the new SUV is longer, wider and taller than its predecessor. Gains in shoulder room, hiproom and legroom are substantial in the first two rows, and you feel them as soon as you get inside this crossover SUV. You'll also see a difference when it comes time to load up groceries. Maximum cargo capacity has ballooned from 81.6 cubic feet to 95.4, and for the first time, a power liftgate is available as an option.Third-row seat dimensions haven't changed much on paper, but in the real world, the Highlander's rearmost seat is much more usable than it was before. Partly, it's due to improved access, as the second-row outboard seats are easier to scoot out of the way. Alternatively, you can just walk through the center aisle to get to the third row. The middle section of any '08 Highlander's 40/20/40 second-row bench can be folded away into its own cubby, leaving you with a pair of captain's chairs -- just like in a minivan. Toyota calls this handy innovation \"Center Stow.\"A couple extra hundred pounds of curb weight is a consequence of the new Highlander's added utility and size, so Toyota has discontinued the base four-cylinder engine. Instead, all 2008 Toyota Highlanders come with a 270-horsepower 3.5-liter V6, the same engine Toyota makes optional in the Camry and RAV4. This puts Toyota's midsize crossover right in line with key rivals like the Buick Enclave/GMC Acadia/Saturn Outlook triplets (275 hp), Mazda CX-9 (270 hp for '08) and Hyundai Veracruz (260 hp), while giving it an advantage over its traditional adversary, the aging Honda Pilot (244 hp).All of these vehicles are worth considering if you're shopping for a practical, easy-to-drive family vehicle with three rows of seating. Larger families will prefer the added space of GM's crossovers or the CX-9, but for medium-size families who already liked the Highlander's combination of convenience, economy and out-and-out refinement, the 2008 model should prove quite desirable. Every 2008 Toyota Highlander comes with a 3.5-liter V6 rated for 270 hp and 248 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed automatic transmission is standard, and 87 octane fuel is all that's required. Even under the more stringent 2008 fuel economy ratings system, the Highlander's mpg estimates are better than average: Front-wheel-drive models carry an 18 mpg city/24 mpg highway rating, while AWD models rate 17/23. Notably, these numbers are higher than the '08 ratings on GM's crossover SUVs, as well as the CX-9 and the Pilot. Towing capacity is a respectable 5,000 pounds when properly equipped. All major safety equipment is standard on the Toyota Highlander, including antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, and hill-start assist (which keeps the vehicle from rolling back when starting on uphill grades). All-wheel-drive models also come with a downhill assist feature to enable slow, controlled descents down snow-covered driveways. Airbag coverage includes front-seat side airbags, three-row curtain airbags and a driver's knee airbag. In frontal-offset crash testing conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the '08 Highlander earned the top rating of \"Good.\" Although the redesigned Highlander is considerably larger and heavier than before, it's still easier to drive than most midsize SUVs, even those of the crossover variety. Visibility is excellent and the steering is light enough to make it easy to maneuver in tight spaces. The now standard V6 delivers strong, smooth acceleration in any situation. The ride quality of all 2008 Toyota Highlanders still leans toward the soft side, but choosing the Sport trim level does get you more tightly controlled body motions without resorting to a harsh ride. Larger and taller adults will find the '08 Highlander's interior more accommodating than in past years, as the first- and second-row seats have grown noticeably in all directions. At the same time, the control layout remains simple and easy to understand, and interior materials quality is high. The Highlander's third-row legroom still falls short of the Acadia/Outlook and CX-9, but getting into the third row is much easier this year thanks to the second-row seats' improved fold/slide mechanisms. Just as useful is the new \"Center Stow\" feature, which allows owners to easily stow the center section of the 40/20/40 second-row bench seat, thus providing walk-through access to the third row. The \"20\" section simply slides into its own cubby under the front-seat center console, and the operation is so simple, the 6-year-old child of one of our editors had it mastered within minutes.Cargo space remains scant when all three rows are in use, as there are just over 10 cubic feet. Folding the third row yields 42 cubes, though, and with the second row down, there are a healthy 95.4 cubic feet -- still short of the Mazda and GM crossovers, but otherwise a good figure for this class. Our only complaint is that the third-row seat folds as a single piece rather than offering a 50/50 split, thus limiting your options when you have a mix of passengers and cargo to carry. Base Highlanders start you out with 17-inch alloy wheels, privacy glass, a fold-flat third-row seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, air-conditioning, a CD stereo with an auxiliary input jack and full power accessories. Stepping up to the Sport provides 19-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, a flip-up rear hatch window, a 3.5-inch information display screen, a back-up camera, an in-dash CD changer (with MP3/WMA capability), upgraded seat fabric, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and one-touch folding capability for the second-row seats. The Highlander Limited also wears 19-inch wheels, but its suspension tuning is softer than the Sport's. In addition, the Limited is fitted with power-folding/heated outside mirrors, an auto-dimming inside mirror, leather upholstery, a 10-way power driver seat, dual-zone automatic climate control (for the front seat), keyless start and wood-grain interior trim.A manual rear air-conditioner is available on base and Sport models, while Limited models offer optional automatic climate control for the rear seats. Base and Sport buyers can also choose to delete the third-row seat (dropping passenger capacity to five) for a price credit. Other options of note on the Toyota Highlander include a sunroof, a power liftgate, heated front seats, a rear DVD entertainment system and towing preparation. The premium-grade JBL sound system supplies Bluetooth connectivity and increases the speaker count from six to nine, but its in-dash changer maxes out at four CDs instead of the usual six. The available navigation system can only be ordered in conjunction with the JBL audio upgrade.",

    "full_description": "The TRD Pro model debuts with an assortment of off-road-specific upgrades.  The 2015 Toyota 4Runner is a rugged body-on-frame SUV that has more off-road capability than almost any rival, but as a daily driver it's lacking a bit of refinement. There are only a few SUVs left these days that utilize  body-on-frame construction for serious off-road capability. Not only is the  2015 Toyota 4Runner one of them, but it also offers three-row seating, a  spacious cargo hold and Toyota's prime  reputation for reliability. If you're hoping to find all of those attributes in  one vehicle, the 4Runner stands alone in this price range. It won't give you  the fuel efficiency or ride comfort of a car-based crossover, but the 2015 4Runner  stays true to its roots as an SUV that's ready for almost anything.\nEven in base SR5 trim, the 4Runner is primed for off-road  action. Standard equipment includes items like mud guards and skid plates,  while four-wheel-drive models add a dual-range transfer case, hill-start assist  and hill-descent control. The Trail trim adds advanced electronic aids for more  precise off-roading, but the big news this year is the range-topping TRD Pro trim level, which  boasts beefier tires, high-performance Bilstein shocks and distinctive styling  elements. Bottom line, any 4Runner can bust trails with the best of them, and  there's more capability than ever for 2015.\nIf you spend most of your time on the pavement, however,  there are better family vehicles available. Specifically, the 4Runner has a difficult  time smoothing out potholes in the city with its busy ride, and its fuel  economy is woeful compared to most V6-powered crossovers. Oh, and that optional  third row we mentioned is best reserved for kids, so if you want adult-sized  space back there, you'll need to look elsewhere.\nThere are several notable 4Runner alternatives to consider.  The 2015 Jeep Grand  Cherokee is one of our favorites if you don't need three seating rows, and  it offers competitive off-road performance, several engine options, more robust  towing capacity, better fuel economy and an upscale interior. The related 2015 Dodge Durango also  has more towing capacity and a premium cabin, and it comes standard with a  third-row seat. The two-row 2015  Nissan Xterra is relatively basic inside, but it's quite similar  mechanically to the 4Runner, and it's considerably cheaper. If you can do  without all the trail-busting hardware, the 2015 Toyota Highlander offers room for eight passengers, a carlike ride and superior efficiency and  acceleration.\nBut if nothing less than a traditional three-row SUV will  do, the 4Runner's the only game in town. It may be among the last of a dying  breed, but the Edmunds  \"B\" rated 2015 Toyota 4Runner still has a lot to offer and is one  of our top picks for a midsize two-row SUV in our 2015 Buying Guide. The 2015 Toyota 4Runner employs a 4.0-liter V6 engine that  produces 270 horsepower and 278 pound-feet of torque. The transmission is a five-speed  automatic. The SR5 and Limited models are available with either rear-wheel  drive or four-wheel drive, while the Trail and TRD Pro are 4WD-only.\nFour-wheel-drive SR5 models have a part-time 4WD system with  low-range gearing, while the Limited uses a full-time 4WD system with low-range  gearing and a locking center differential. The Trail and TRD Pro models come  standard with the part-time 4WD system and also include a locking rear  differential, crawl control (for use in low range) and selectable terrain modes.  Properly equipped, the 4Runner is rated to tow up to 4,700 pounds. \nIn Edmunds testing, a 4WD 4Runner Trail went from zero to 60  mph in 7.8 seconds, which is about average among competing SUVs. \nThe EPA  estimates fuel economy at 19 mpg combined (17 city/22 highway) for RWD models and 18 mpg combined (17 city/21 highway) for all 4WD 4Runners. Those numbers are typical for a  traditional SUV, but well behind those of most V6-powered crossovers.  Standard safety features on the 2015 Toyota 4Runner include  antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front seat side airbags,  full-length side curtain airbags, front knee airbags and active front head  restraints. All 4WD models feature an off-road traction control system known as  A-Trac that helps keep you moving on slippery terrain by redirecting engine  torque to the wheel(s) that have traction.\nA rearview camera is standard across the board, but front  and rear parking sensors are only available on the Limited trim level. The  Limited also comes with Safety Connect, which includes automatic collision  notification, a stolen-vehicle locator and emergency assistance.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, a four-wheel-drive 4Runner Trail  model took 132 feet to stop from 60 mph, which is a long distance by crossover  standards but not bad for an off-road-oriented SUV.\nIn government crash tests, the 4Runner earned four  out of a possible five stars overall, including four stars for total  frontal impact safety and five stars for total side-impact safety. The  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the 4Runner its top rating  of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and  roof-strength crash tests, but the small-overlap frontal-offset crash test  resulted in a \"Marginal\" rating (second-lowest). The 4Runner's seat/head  restraint design was rated \"Good\" for whiplash protection in  rear-impact crashes.  The Toyota 4Runner is designed to provide real utility when  the pavement ends. It's at its best when you're plugging along on off-road  trails, and the numerous upgrades on the Trail and TRD Pro trims only add to  the fun. At the same time, the 4Runner is refined enough for the daily grind,  though lots of bumps make it in to the cabin as the rugged suspension and big  tires jostle you around. The 4Runner's steering feels a little too light in  normal driving situations, but this turns out to be ideal for off-roading, as  it results in reduced kickback on gnarly trails.\nThe 4Runner's V6 engine is strong enough for most needs, but  there's no denying that you get more grunt from rivals like the V8-powered Grand  Cherokee and Durango. The 4Runner's five-speed automatic transmission provides  well-timed shifts, but we certainly wouldn't mind another gear to calm the  engine on the highway and eke out another mpg or two. The interior of the 2015 Toyota 4Runner features instruments  and controls that are well laid out and easy to understand, while the gauges  are equally attractive and legible. Most owners will be satisfied with the  quality of the 4Runner's cabin materials, which are oriented more toward  durability than aesthetics. If you want something a bit more plush, something  like the Jeep Grand Cherokee will likely be a better fit.\nIn addition, all 4Runners come with a touchscreen audio  interface placed high on the center stack. Depending on which trim level you've  selected, the touchscreen brings various degrees of functionality from Toyota's Entune suite of smartphone-enabled  services and apps. All trims except the base SR5 and Trail integrate a  navigation system into this interface. \nAs for passenger accommodations, the standard five-person  seating arrangement includes a reclining 40/20/40-split-folding second-row  seat.\u00a0The  optional third-row seat is bound to be a tempting option for carpoolers, but  you'll want to make sure your elementary schoolers will actually fit, as this  is one of the smallest, tightest third rows of any midsize SUV.\nIn reality, the real estate in the back of the 4Runner is  better suited for cargo. There are a healthy 47 cubic feet of cargo room behind  the second-row seats, a number that jumps to an even healthier 89.7 cubic feet  with all the rear seats folded down. This is far more space than the Grand  Cherokee offers, and more than many large crossovers (such as the Ford Explorer  and Honda Pilot) as well. \nThe SR5 comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, skid  plates, mud guards, a tow hitch, hill-start assist and hill-descent control  (4WD only), a rearview camera, foglights, heated exterior mirrors, rear privacy  glass, LED taillights, roof rails, a power liftgate window, a windshield wiper  de-icer, keyless entry, cruise control, air-conditioning with second-row vents,  cloth upholstery, a six-way power driver seat with power lumbar adjustment, a  leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and 40/20/40-split folding  and reclining rear seats. Standard electronics includes Bluetooth phone and  audio connectivity and an eight-speaker audio system with a 6.1-inch touchscreen  interface, voice controls, a CD player, HD and satellite radio, an auxiliary  audio jack and an iPod/USB audio interface. \nThe SR5 Premium adds a sunroof, upgraded exterior mirrors, leatherette  (premium vinyl) upholstery, heated front seats, a power front passenger seat, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror and an upgraded version of Entune with smartphone  app integration and a navigation system.\nGo with the 4WD-only Trail trim and you'll get all of the  base SR5's standard features plus unique 17-inch wheels, a hood scoop, silver  exterior trim accents, a locking rear differential, selectable terrain modes  and crawl control. The Trail Premium model adds the SR5 Premium's standard  features.\nThe 4Runner Trail models are exclusively eligible for the  optional Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS), which automatically disconnects  the SUV's stabilizer bars in low-speed off-road situations to improve  suspension articulation over deep ruts and boulders.\nThe TRD Pro comes with most of the Trail Premium's standard  equipment, adding or substituting matte-black 17-inch wheels with special  off-road tires, automatic headlights, a TRD-stamped aluminum front skid plate, Bilstein  shocks, upgraded front springs, a higher ride height, a unique black front  grille and various TRD-themed aesthetic upgrades. \nThe 4Runner Limited includes most of the Trail Premium's feature  content, but it lacks the mud guards, locking rear differential, terrain-mode  selector and crawl control. Its available full-time 4WD system instead employs  a locking center differential. Other Limited highlights include 20-inch alloy  wheels, adaptive roll-reducing dampers (X-REAS), automatic headlights, front  and rear parking sensors, keyless entry and ignition, dual-zone automatic  climate control, leather upholstery, ventilated front seats and a 15-speaker JBL  sound system and Toyota's Safety Connect telematics.\nMany of the higher-end standard amenities are available as  options on lower trim levels, but availability can vary depending on the region  of the United States in which you live. Stand-alone options include fixed running  boards, automatically deploying/retracting running boards, a sliding rear cargo  floor (two-row models only) and roof-rack crossbars.",

    "full_description": "The 2010 Toyota Camry Hybrid receives revised front-end styling, a new instrument cluster and unique upholstery made of silk protein and synthetic fiber. The 2010 Toyota Camry Hybrid is the rare hybrid that makes both environmental and financial sense. It's quicker than a regular four-cylinder Camry, it's far better on gas and it's only marginally more expensive than a comparable non-hybrid four-cylinder model. Hybrid-powered vehicles may warm the green-hued hearts of their owners, but they also tend to lighten owners' wallets. Sure, they'll save you money on gas, but typically, you have to pay so much more up front for hybrid technology that you'll never recoup that initial investment. The 2010 Toyota Camry Hybrid is the rare exception to that rule. Thanks to a dual-mode gas-electric hybrid powertrain, its green credentials are impeccable -- 34 combined mpg and Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (AT-PZEV) certification -- yet it's barely more expensive than Toyota's top-of-the-line four-cylinder Camry XLE. What's more, its 187 horsepower combined output makes it quicker to boot.In fairness, the XLE has some luxuries that the Hybrid lacks, such as premium JBL audio (an extra-cost option on the Hybrid) and reclining rear seats (XLE only). But for consumers with heightened green consciousness -- or those who just want a vehicular hedge against future gas price spikes -- trading such accoutrements for about 9 mpg extra might be worthwhile. And it's not like the Camry Hybrid comes sparsely equipped; on the contrary, it boasts dual-zone automatic climate control and an eight-way power driver seat, among other niceties. For 2010, you even get something for nothing: The Camry Hybrid receives refreshed exterior styling, a new instrument cluster and exclusive \"Fraichir\" silk protein and synthetic fiber seating surfaces (Toyota says it's softer to the skin than normal fabric upholstery), yet the price remains the same as it was in '09.The Camry Hybrid's sophisticated hybrid powertrain can run solely on electric power at low speeds and while coasting on the highway, and the electric motor provides a tangible kick during hard acceleration, particularly at higher speeds. Otherwise, though, the Camry Hybrid is virtually indistinguishable from a regular Camry. As such, expect a spacious cabin, comfortable seats and a driving experience that isolates you from the outside world. Notably, the Nissan Altima Hybrid shares the Camry Hybrid's powertrain while providing a more engaging driving experience, but the Nissan is only available in California and the seven states that currently follow that state's tailpipe regulations: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. Also, the Altima isn't as cosseting as the Camry.The 2010 Toyota Camry Hybrid has a couple of new competitors this year in the Ford Fusion Hybrid and its more upscale corporate sibling, the Mercury Milan Hybrid. Each boasts an EPA rating that's more impressive than the Toyota's. Hybrid-happy shoppers should also consider the practical and significantly more-fuel-efficient Toyota Prius, and those on a budget might want to take the new Honda Insight for a spin. Overall, though, the Camry Hybrid remains one of the best hybrid deals going, offering an enviable combination of excellent fuel economy and familiar midsize-sedan goodness. The Camry Hybrid is powered by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder gas engine working in concert with an electric motor. Power is sent to the front wheels via a specialized continuously variable transmission (CVT). The gas engine produces 147 hp and 138 pound-feet of torque, and the electric motor adds another 40 hp, yielding 187 maximum hp. The Camry Hybrid can also run on electric power alone, but only under light throttle applications at speeds below 30 mph.With a respectable 8.4-second sprint from zero to 60 mph, the Camry Hybrid's acceleration falls between that of the four-cylinder and V6 non-hybrid Camrys, though it's closer to the four's. Fuel economy is an impressive 33 mpg city/34 mpg highway and 34 mpg combined. The 2010 Toyota Camry Hybrid features standard front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag, antilock disc brakes and stability control. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash testing, the Camry Hybrid received five out of five stars in all front and side collision categories. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety also awarded the Camry its highest rating of \"Good\" for frontal offset and side collision protection. Driving the 2010 Toyota Camry Hybrid can be a bit odd due to the CVT, electric motor and eerily quiet cabin at traffic lights. Unlike many other hybrids, though, the Camry Hybrid offers relatively brisk acceleration, meaning you don't necessarily have to sacrifice performance for good fuel economy. While the Camry offers a smooth ride and quiet cabin, the flip side of that coin is lifeless steering and high-seas body roll; for most hybrid shoppers, though, these foibles are unlikely to be deal breakers. There's some visual interest in the Camry Hybrid's cabin, thanks largely to the ice-blue backlit trim on the center stack, but the general quality has slipped a bit relative to Camrys of old. Still, interior materials are adequate for a midsize sedan, and the car's inherent quietness combines with the hybrid powertrain's frequent electric-only silence to create a consistent impression of refinement. Comfy seats along with numerous cubbies and compartments make the Hybrid's interior a thoroughly family-friendly environment. The hybrid system's battery packs do eat into trunk space significantly (10.6 cubic feet versus 15 in the regular Camry), but a 60/40-split-folding rear seatback provides some added utility when needed. Bundled into various packages, Camry Hybrid options include a sunroof, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a four-way power passenger seat, a navigation system, satellite radio and a JBL sound system with a six-CD changer and Bluetooth.",

    "full_description": "The  2019 Toyota Tacoma is the quintessential pickup truck. It offers strong towing  capacity, excellent off-road ability, and all the utility you could ask for in  a midsize truck. Sure, it also has modern amenities and safety features that  keep it competitive in an ultra-modern class of pickups. But mostly, the Tacoma  is a truck that's dedicated to getting you anywhere you want to go.  \nUnder  the hood, the Tacoma offers a relatively efficient four-cylinder engine or a  more robust V6. It can be had with two- or four-wheel drive, and it's available  as a crew-cab or extended-cab truck. So, it has all the basics covered. Then,  when you move inside, there's a solid base of standard equipment such as a rearview camera,  forward collision warning and a stereo with USB and Bluetooth connectivity.\nAlong with extra creature-comfort features such as heated seats and an upgraded stereo, the  Tacoma also offers some of  the most impressive off-road packages in the class \u2014 with items such  as monotube or internal bypass shocks, skid plates, a hood-mounted snorkel  intake, and advanced traction control systems. \nAs  you might expect with such a utilitarian vehicle, especially one with so much  off-road capability, the Tacoma suffers a bit in the comfort department.  Competitors have it beat when it comes to ride comfort, seat comfort, interior  space and infotainment interfaces. Despite those drawbacks, however, the Tacoma  should be at the top of any truck shopper's short list.\nNotably, we picked the 2019 Toyota Tacoma TRD as one of Edmunds' Best Off-Road Trucks for this year.\nWhat's it like to live with?\nWe wanted to know what the newest Tacoma was like to live  with, so the Edmunds' editorial team purchased a 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off  Road to see for ourselves. We lived with it for nearly two years, putting  40,155 miles on the odometer. The Tacoma has received some updates since it's  redesign in 2016, so the 2019 model is slightly different. There are some  additional standard safety features such as lane departure alert and forward  collision warning, a few extra USB ports, and a few more options to choose  from, but it's the same generation truck, so most of our observations still  apply. To learn more about the Toyota Tacoma, check out all the details in our long-term test, where we cover everything from  seat comfort to real-world fuel economy. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are  fundamentally similar. The  ratings in this review are based on our full test of the Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road Double Cab\u00a0 (3.5L V6 | 6-speed automatic | 4WD | 5-foot bed). The Tacoma's 3.5-liter V6 puts up decent power and torque specs, but it's not at all responsive when driven casually. You'll need to rev it up to get it to respond. At our test track, our Tacoma did the 0-60 mph sprint in 8.1 seconds, which is notably slower than the Colorado, Ridgeline and Ranger. There's a lot of nosedive, and the brakes are difficult to modulate because of a too-jumpy initial bite and too-aggressive release characteristics. Hard stops are straight and true, but our 60-0 mph panic-stop test persisted for 140 feet. That's not as good as it could be, but it's about average for a 4WD pickup with off-road package tires. The steering is predictable but also slow and deliberate. The effort buildup is smooth and progressive as you guide the Tacoma through corners, and it's steady and connected when cruising straight. The chunky leather-wrapped steering wheel feels good in your hands. When off-roading, it's precise and reassuring. Handling comment: Body roll is gradual and restrained. The Tacoma imparts a good sense of overall competence and coordination on the sorts of winding roads you inevitably need to traverse on the way to the campground, ski lodge or trailhead. The grip from the off-road package tires is similar to others in the class. Only the Ridgeline handles more like a car . The Tacoma's six-speed automatic shifts smoothly, but its calibration favors higher gears and hunts annoyingly due to wide gear spacing and the engine's relative lack of torque. The ECT Power mode alters shift points to help but not enough. All versions do well, but the TRD Off-Road and the TRD Pro have the suspension, tires and abundant clearance to go places other pickups cannot. A locking differential and the Multi-Terrain Select and Crawl Control systems are real advantages, and the throttle and brake response feel excellent when crawling in low range. The seats feel comfortable and supportive even though their adjustments are quite simple. The bigger issue is the seating position, which is more legs-out than expected in a truck. The ride is decently smooth. The Bilstein shocks and the tall sidewalls of the 16-inch TRD Off-Road tires are adept at filtering out small road flaws \u2014 better, in fact, than the Limited's 18-inch tires. Still, the ride is truckier compared to some others. The Tacoma's cabin is decently quiet from wind and road noise. The engine and exhaust moan unpleasantly when under load. Even so, it's not a bad place to pass the miles. We like the chunky size and obvious operation of the Tacoma's climate controls, and the outlets are easy to aim and close. The system heats and cools the cabin effectively, too. All the switchgear is exceptionally easy to reach and understand. That includes the automatic climate control and touchscreen audio system, which are operated via knobs. A high floor results from the Tacoma's high-ground-clearance, off-road design philosophy. The Tacoma has a notably higher step-in than trucks such as the Colorado, and the odd legs-out seating position reduces step-out leverage. Compared to the Colorado ZR2, the TRD Pro has a lower, more accessible seat. It's an odd driving position due to the proximity of the seat bottom to the floor \u2014 your legs largely stick straight out. Your position is less natural than in other trucks. The steering wheel's telescoping range is minimal. There's plenty of personal space in the Tacoma. Front-seat headroom isn't expansive, but you've got to be at least 6 feet tall to notice. The crew cab's back seat is cozier than the Colorado's, but it has more toe space. The view is clear out in all directions, and the high seating position makes it easy to spot the front corners. The rear windows are large, and the mirrors are a good size. The interior features panels look less like hard plastic than the competition's, even though they don't really impress. The build quality is solid, and our test truck didn't squeak or rattle, even when off-roading. There are a good-size console bin and glovebox, plus a couple of small cubbies. The door pockets are average, which isn't saying much among midsize pickups. Overall, cabin storage meets expectations, but it's nothing to write home about. The crew cab's folding rear seat is more cargo-friendly than the Colorado's despite its smaller backseat volume. It's also fussier to fold, but the payoff is a far lower load height and a totally flat load surface with a tough plastic facing. Plus you'll find storage cubbies beneath the seat bottom and seatback. LATCH points are provided, and they are easy enough to find and use. But the top tethers are hard to access because you've got to tip the rear seatback forward. The Tacoma's crew cab isn't roomy, so bulkier seats will not fit without front passengers scooting forward to make allowances. A rear-wheel-drive V6 Tacoma can tow as much as 6,800 pounds. Our TRD Off-Road can tow 6,400 pounds. Both are solid numbers for a midsize truck. The tow package includes hitch, wiring, extra cooling, a bigger alternator and trailer sway control. The Tacoma's rated payload isn't stellar, but it's the top dog when it comes to the bed itself. The standard composite bed is its own bedliner, and it includes prominent notches to enable two-tier loading. The tailgate is damped, and the bedsides are low enough that it's easy to reach in and grab cargo. Inside, there are six tie-down eyes, four movable tie-down cleats and two molded-in storage compartments. An optional 120-volt, 400-watt power outlet is available. The touchscreen audio system uses a pleasing combination of fixed buttons, virtual touchscreen buttons, and fixed volume and tune knobs. The optional JBL audio system sounds great for a truck-based system. Built-in navigation is a necessary (and inexpensive) option because it's the main way to get a map on the screen. The Tacoma lacks Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support, favoring Toyota's proprietary, and needlessly complicated, Entune system instead. Best to soldier on without that. Bluetooth phone and audio pairing is easy enough. Every Tacoma comes standard with a safety suite that includes automated emergency braking, lane departure warning, a drowsy driver warning system, adaptive cruise control and automatic high beams. On competing models, aids such as these are optional, relegated to higher trim levels or simply not available. Toyota's voice command system requires a bit of a learning curve to allow the system to adjust to your style of speech through a setup process. It works OK after that, but it still isn't too responsive to compound commands and natural speech. iPhone users have it easy because, even though there's no CarPlay, it does support Siri \u2014 just press and hold the voice button longer. The  topped-out TRD Pro and Limited trim levels are the most appealing of the Tacoma  offerings, but they're also the most expensive. So, if you're looking for great  value alongside great capability, we recommend the TRD Off-Road trim level. It comes with the upgraded V6 powertrain and can be had in both  extended-cab or crew-cab configurations. It is also available with an  impressive suite of comfort features such as heated front seats, dual-zone climate control and an  upgraded JBL stereo. \nWhile  the SR is the least-expensive Tacoma, it isn't entirely bare-bones. It can be had with an  extended cab (Access Cab) with a  6.1-foot bed or a crew cab (Double Cab)  with a 5-foot bed, and you can choose between two-wheel drive or  part-time four-wheel drive with a low-range transfer case. Its 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine  (159 horsepower, 180 lb-ft of torque) is paired to a six-speed automatic  transmission. \nOther  standard equipment for the SR includes 16-inch steel wheels, a sliding rear window with privacy glass, heated  power-adjustable side mirrors, a tough composite bed that needs no bedliner, a  movable cleat tie-down system, and a backup camera fitted in the tailgate  release handle. Inside, there are four-way-adjustable cloth seats (with  driver-side lumbar adjustment), a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a  4.2-inch driver display screen, forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking, lane departure alert, automatic high beams, adaptive cruise  control, and a basic Entune stereo, which supports Bluetooth and Siri Eyes Free  voice control and has a USB interface. \nFor most buyers, the SR5 is the better deal. On top of the SR equipment, you can also  get a long-wheelbase version that pairs the crew cab with the 6.1-foot bed. On  the outside, you get some chrome exterior trim, foglights and 16-inch alloy  wheels. Also included on the SR5 are remote keyless entry and a leather-wrapped  steering wheel with control buttons for an enhanced Entune audio system, which  supports satellite radio and comes with smartphone-enabled navigation via the  Scout GPS app.\nNext up is the TRD Sport. It is offered in the same cab and bed configurations as  the SR5, but it replaces the four-cylinder engine with a 3.5-liter V6 (278 hp,  265 lb-ft). All rear-wheel-drive versions use  the six-speed automatic, but four-wheel-drive buyers can choose between the  automatic and a performance-oriented six-speed manual. \nThe  TRD Sport comes with 17-inch  alloy wheels, body-colored fender flares and rear bumper, turn signals in the  mirror housings, a hood scoop, a 120-volt/400-watt power outlet in the bed, a  power-sliding rear window (crew-cab only), push-button start (for  automatic-transmission trucks), a wireless smartphone charging pad, and a  7-inch center touchscreen with navigation.\nThe TRD Off-Road offers nearly the same configuration and engine  options as the TRD Sport, and its truck bed and interior and audio trimmings are  identical. Visual differences include a chrome rear bumper, textured black  fender flares and the absence of the Sport's hood scoop. Off-road performance  changes include the deletion of the front airdam, extra skid plates, a lockable  rear differential, Bilstein monotube shocks, and an advanced off-road traction  control system with multiple terrain settings and crawl control.\nBoth  the TRD Sport and the TRD Off-Road crew-cab models can be upgraded with a few  option packages. Feature highlights include a sunroof, parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring with  rear cross-traffic alert, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated seats,  leather upholstery, and a JBL speaker upgrade and a subwoofer. It's  worth noting that the stereo  upgrade is not available on models with the manual transmission.\nThe Limited is the most refined version  of the Tacoma. It is only offered as a V6-powered crew cab with the short bed in either two- or four-wheel  drive. It has a  body-colored rear bumper and flares, and it rolls on 18-inch wheels with  lower-profile tires. It lacks the TRD Off-Road's specialized off-road  upgrades and is instead  upgraded with just about all of the Off-Road's and Sport's optional features as  standard equipment. \nThe TRD Pro is sold only as a crew cab with a short bed, and  it comes only in  four-wheel drive. The  V6 engine is standard, but you can choose between the manual and the automatic  transmission. It's  equipped like a loaded-up TRD Off-Road, but it sets itself apart with special styling details,  including a black grille, and performance upgrades such as Fox internal bypass  shocks, all-terrain tires, a thicker front skid plate, and a ride height that's  an inch taller.",

    "full_description": "The Hybrid can now be had in a new LE base trim level, further lowering its point of entry. The SE also gains 0.4 inch of ground clearance. If you're having trouble picking a  compact crossover, we don't blame you. There's a ton of them. They're all  pretty good, and they often even look alike. Among this group, the regular  Toyota RAV4 doesn't stand out much. In general, we've found rivals such as the  Honda CR-V and Mazda CX-5 to be more refined, engaging and even luxurious. But  the 2018 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid has something even those models lack: exceptional  fuel economy. The higher fuel economy of the RAV4  Hybrid allows it to exit the shadows and draw attention to itself. That would  be, perhaps not surprisingly, its fuel economy of 32 mpg combined. None of its  conventionally powered competitors can match that and it doesn't come with an  overly prohibitive price premium. When you consider that along with its  standard safety tech, huge interior, surprising acceleration and, yes, Toyota's  reliability reputation, the RAV4 Hybrid becomes one of the must-drive vehicles  in the segment. Notably, we picked the 2018 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid as one of Edmunds' Best Hybrid SUVs for this year. You wouldn't necessarily expect it, but the 2018 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid is more appealing than its gas-only sibling. The Hybrid gets 32 mpg in combined driving and gives up hardly anything to the regular RAV4. It's the RAV4 to get. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2017 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid XLE (2.5L  inline-4 hybrid | CVT automatic | AWD). The instant torque provided by the battery and dual electric motors help the Hybrid jump off the line quicker than the standard RAV4. Makes you wish that every compact crossover had a hybrid variant. Zero to 60 takes 8 seconds flat, quicker than any non-turbocharged rival. The brake pedal is long and mushy with little resistance. The handoff from regenerative to mechanical brakes is noticeable, making it hard to brake smoothly. Braking to a stop from 60 mph took 123 feet, a few feet longer than average. Steering effort is a little heavier than normal for this class. The wheel isn't difficult to turn, however, and it's easy to turn into a parking spot. Out on the road, rivals from Ford, Honda and Mazda provide more engaging and confidence-inspiring steering. You wouldn't think a big, heavy crossover (it tips the scales at nearly 4,000 pounds) goes around corners well, but you'd be surprised. The RAV4 Hybrid is composed around sweeping corners at higher speeds. Tight corners and back-to-back transitions reveal ample body roll. The Hybrid pulls away from a stop under battery power, but there's a noticeable shudder and kick-in when the engine fires to life midacceleration. Avoid driving in Eco mode; it severely dulls throttle response. Sport mode keeps the engine revving higher, but responses are still sluggish at times. The RAV4 Hybrid is technically all-wheel-drive, but it relies on an electric motor for rear power and the system isn't a mechanical one like the regular RAV4's and lacks the locking center differential. It's not well-suited to adventures off the beaten path. Front seats are comfy enough, but there's no lumbar adjustment unless you upgrade to the SE (though its imitation leather isn't as comfy as the XLE's cloth). Only the driver seat is height-adjustable. Three-person seating in the back is challenging due to an oddly placed middle seat-belt anchor. The SE's sporty suspension tuning improves handling but not enough to warrant the busier and harsher ride. Perhaps the extra suspension travel for 2018 will change this, but we'd probably stick with any of the other, more comfortable-riding trim levels. There's not much engine noise at any speed unless you're really pushing the RAV4 Hybrid hard. There's a noticeable jolt when the gas engine kicks in after pulling away from a start under electric power. Wind and tire noise is overly intrusive while cruising on the highway. Others are much quieter. The dual-zone climate control adeptly cools the interior on a hot day. There are no rear air vents. Toggle switches for the heated seats are hidden depending on viewing angle, so you'll have to remember to switch them off. Even on the low setting, they get nice and toasty. The infotainment system features a nice mix between physical buttons and easy-to-press virtual ones. Eco and Sport buttons are out of the way, as are toggle switches for the heated front seats. The door's vertical-oriented grab handles mean the rear armrests are really just elbow rests. A low step-in height and tall doors make for easy entry and exit in the front, except for drivers who like a raised seat. The steering wheel tilt is limited, and drivers may hit their knees on the column. Entering/exiting the rear is also easy due to the seats' lack of thigh padding and bolstering. The driver's seat offers enough range of height adjustment, and the seat bottom angles up nicely. As in many other Toyotas, the steering wheel doesn't offer enough tilt or telescoping adjustment. There's an abundance of head- and legroom throughout the cabin. Four 6-footers will have no problem on a long road trip. Even the middle seat position has enough headroom for an adult. Side bolsters make the front seats a bit narrow. The tall and wide windows allow for an expansive view out. There's a sizable window in the three-quarter view that compensates for the wide rear roof pillar. The rear window is also large. Overall, the RAV4 is impressively easy to see out of. The RAV4 looks and feels cheap compared to its top competitors. There's a ton of hard plastic throughout, and the utilitarian design doesn't help. SofTex vinyl covers the seats in top four trims, but unlike other faux leathers, it's obviously vinyl and there's no option for real leather. Two different-size cupholders are separated by the shifter. There are a couple of small, oddly shaped storage areas on the center stack, including a shallow, low-grip smartphone holder that isn't very good at holding smartphones. Not great for this family-friendly segment. The cargo area is wide and flat, with a low liftover height. The maximum cargo volume of 35.6 cubic feet with the rear seats in place and 70.6 cubes with them folded is slightly less than what the regular RAV4 offers. But it's still larger than the cargo areas of almost every other nonhybrid. The lower LATCH anchors are well-concealed and far from the seatback; you really have to reach in and fish around to find them. The three seatback tethers can be accessed with the cargo cover in place, but these are also hidden under a thin cloth cover. Unlike the regular RAV4, which can be optioned to tow up to 3,500 pounds, the Hybrid is limited to 1,750 pounds. It's one of the few sacrifices for going battery-electric. The standard touchscreen is easy to use. It has a relatively simple layout and menu structure, but it's not particularly attractive, the screen is small and resolution is fairly low. Optional 7-inch screen offers nominal improvement. Either washes out in direct sunlight. There's a single USB port in front and none in the back. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are notably absent. Instead, Toyota uses a smartphone integration system of its own design called Entune. You'll have to download the app, create an account, and pair your phone before it's ready to be used. Unique for the segment, the RAV4 comes standard with forward collision warning, automatic braking, lane keeping assist and adaptive cruise control. Blind-spot warning is available on all but LE. Adaptive cruise doesn't maintain speed downhill and the clarity of the standard rearview camera is poor. Hitting the voice control button displays a list of phrases, and the recognition software also recognizes natural speech. It's not the best, with a lot of garbled translations before it hits the mark. Best to use Siri Eyes Free if you have an iPhone (accessed by holding the phone disconnect button). We would recommend a RAV4 Hybrid XLE.  For about $2,000 over the LE, it provides enough desirable equipment that will  actually make a difference to you on the daily drive. You really don't need the  SE's sportier suspension, and its simulated upholstery is not as appealing as  the XLE's fabric. We also like that you can opt separately for the heated front  seats with eight-way driver-seat adjustment. The new-for-2018 LE base trim comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic  headlights, heated mirrors, integrated blind-spot mirrors, rear privacy glass,  roof rails, keyless ignition and entry, a rearview camera, dual-zone automatic  climate control, a height-adjustable driver seat, and a 60/40-split folding and  reclining second-row seat.Also standard is Toyota Safety Sense P  (forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency  braking, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic high  beams), a 6.1-inch touchscreen interface, Bluetooth, one USB port, and a  six-speaker sound system with a CD player, a media player interface and an  auxiliary audio jack. The XLE adds foglights, a sunroof, an upgraded rearview camera, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, and the Entune Audio Plus with Connected Navigation package  that includes satellite radio, HD radio, Siri Eyes Free and a Scout GPS  smartphone-based navigation system. Heated front seats with eight-way power adjustment for the driver is optional.The SE adds sportier suspension  tuning, 18-inch wheels, special exterior styling, blind-spot monitoring and  rear cross-traffic alert systems (optional on XLE), automatic LED headlights,  LED running lights and taillights, a height-adjustable power liftgate, an  eight-way power driver seat with lumbar adjustment, heated front seats and  SofTex vinyl upholstery.The Limited reverts to the XLE's styling and suspension tuning, but includes the SE's  other upgrades. It further adds front and rear parking sensors, chrome exterior  trim, driver-seat memory functions, an auto-dimming mirror, and the Entune  Premium Audio with Integrated Navigation and App Suite (optional on the XLE and  SE) that includes a 7-inch higher-resolution touchscreen, a variety of  smartphone apps and an integrated hard-drive-based Toyota navigation system. A  hands-free liftgate is a stand-alone option.An 11-speaker JBL audio system can be  added to the SE and Limited trim levels as either a stand-alone item or within  an Advanced Technology package that also includes a bird's-eye view parking  camera, and on the SE, the parking sensors and auto-dimming mirror. The XLE's  Hybrid Convenience package adds blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic  alert, parking sensors, the power liftgate, and the Entune Premium Audio with  Integrated Navigation and App suite.",

    "full_description": "For 2009, the Toyota Sequoia gets an available sport package. Dubbed SX, it includes 20-inch wheels, a color-keyed grille, foglights and a rear spoiler. Also, flex-fuel (E85 ethanol) versions become available in certain regions of the country. The most refined, user-friendly and versatile choice in the full-size SUV segment, the 2009 Toyota Sequoia is an attractive option for large families who have heavy trailers to tow. After experiencing 2008's $4-a-gallon-gas  wake-up call, those who purchase an imposingly large SUV these days do so at  their own risk. Those who take the plunge, though, will hopefully do so because  they have a genuine need for the vehicle's massive passenger, cargo and hauling  capabilities, and not for something as foolish as \"image  enhancement.\" Either way, shoppers looking for one of these burly beasts  of burden would be hard-pressed to find a better one than the 2009 Toyota  Sequoia.\nLast year's complete redesign of the Sequoia  (which was based on the current Tundra platform) resulted in &mdash;  surprise, surprise &mdash; larger dimensions. But it also provided more  room, stronger performance, more composed road manners and greater seating  flexibility. A unique feature that should prove useful for growing families is  the Sequoia's versatile second-row seats, which are available as a  40/20/40-split bench or as captain's chairs. Either way, those seats offer a  broad range of fore-aft adjustment, allowing them to be positioned to optimize  legroom or cargo room as needs dictate. Unlike the Tundra (and GM's full-size  SUVs), the Sequoia has an independent rear suspension, which allows the SUV's  roomy 60/40-split third-row seat to fold flat. Fold down both the second and  third rows for an enormous 120 cubic feet of cargo space.\nUnder the hood, the Sequoia has one of two V8  engines. Though the older 4.7-liter V8 is still standard on the base SR5 trim,  most Sequoias have Toyota's latest 381-horsepower 5.7-liter V8. Fitted with the  bigger engine, the Sequoia is the quickest rig in the large SUV segment and  boasts a massive 9,100-pound towing capacity. Once underway, the Sequoia's  chassis tuning provides an ideal balance between highway comfort and back-road  agility, while a relatively tight 39-foot turning circle makes the big truck easy  to maneuver in parking lots.\nAs well-rounded as the 2009 Toyota Sequoia is,  it's prudent to mention that buyers who don't require its impressive towing  capacity might also consider any number of large crossovers, such as the Ford  Flex, the GMC Acadia (or its Buick Enclave/Chevy Traverse/Saturn Outlook  relatives) or the Mazda CX-9. These crossovers offer almost as much passenger  and cargo space, yet they cost considerably less, handle better and get better  fuel economy.\nThat said, if you need a heavy-duty, full-size  SUV, the 2009 Toyota Sequoia is the best choice there is. Yes, this segment  also offers the solidly qualified Chevrolet Tahoe-GMC Yukon twins, the Ford  Expedition and the Nissan Armada. But when it comes to versatile passenger  accommodations, strong overall performance and well-balanced ride and handling  dynamics, the Sequoia is most worth the risk. Standard on the Sequoia SR5 is a 4.7-liter V8  (276 hp and 314 pound-feet of torque) matched to a five-speed automatic  transmission. Optional on the SR5 and standard on all other Sequoias is a  5.7-liter V8 (381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque) paired with a six-speed  automatic. As expected, the Sequoia is available with either two-wheel drive or  four-wheel drive. An unusual feature is that the center differential can be  locked in both 4-Hi and 4-Lo, thereby providing greater flexibility when  driving in snowy conditions. In our testing, a 4WD Sequoia with the 5.7-liter  V8 hit 60 mph in an impressive 6.7 seconds.\nThe Sequoia's fuel economy is slightly better  than that of most rivals. The 5.7-liter V8 is less thirsty than the smaller V8  thanks to its dual variable valve timing and more efficient six-speed  automatic. A 2WD Sequoia 5.7 rates 15 mpg combined (14 city/19 highway), while  the 4.7-liter version rates 15 mpg combined (14 city/17 highway). Properly  equipped, this SUV can tow up to 9,100 pounds. Every 2009 Toyota Sequoia comes with antilock  disc brakes, stability control, front-seat side airbags and three-row side  curtain airbags. Front and rear parking sensors are standard on the Sequoia  Platinum and the Limited and optional on the SR5. A backup camera is available  on the Platinum and optional on the SR5 and the Limited. In the government's  frontal crash test, the Sequoia earned five stars (out of five) for the driver  and four for the passenger. Even if you don't ordinarily like large SUVs,  the 2009 Toyota Sequoia will do its best to warm your heart with its pleasant  driving experience. Thanks to the 5.7-liter V8 underhood, low-end torque is  abundant, and passing maneuvers come and go in an instant. Plus, the six-speed  automatic is always on point with gear selection, even when towing.\nRide comfort ranges from smooth and composed  in an SR5 model with optional air springs to downright plush in a Sequoia  Platinum with the adaptive suspension. Around corners, the suspension does an  excellent job of managing three tons' worth of SUV. The steering is also  well-weighted and precise as full-size SUVs go. There's only one significant shortcoming in  the Toyota Sequoia's cabin: It has the same hard-to-reach audio and navigation  controls as the Tundra pickup. Otherwise, this interior is a triumph of  ergonomics, storage bins and family-friendly conveniences. The second-row seats  adjust fore and aft whether your Sequoia has the bench or the captain's chairs.  The bench seat's center \"20\" section also slides farther forward to  provide easier access to a child seat. There's also a conversation mirror so  you can monitor potential hostilities in the third row. The 60/40-split folding  third-row seat in Limited and Platinum models has both a power recline and a  power fold feature. With both sets of rear seats folded down, the Sequoia's  cargo space tops out at 121 cubic feet. \nBase SR5 models have 18-inch alloy wheels, a  40/20/40-split second-row bench seat, triple-zone automatic climate control, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, full power accessories, and a CD stereo  with an auxiliary audio jack. The Limited adds running boards, heated side  mirrors, leather upholstery, power front seats, upgraded instrumentation, and  an upgraded JBL sound system with a six-CD changer.\nThe ritzy Sequoia Platinum sizes up to 20-inch  wheels while adding load-leveling rear air springs, an adaptive variable  suspension, adaptive shock absorbers, a power liftgate, a sunroof, heated and  cooled front seats, second-row captain's chairs (dropping capacity to seven), a  navigation system, a backup camera, and a power tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel.\nLeather upholstery and JBL sound are optional  on the SR5, while the rear air springs, sunroof and nav system are available on  both the SR5 and the Limited. A sport package dubbed SX is also optional on the  SR5, and it includes 20-inch wheels, a color-keyed grille, foglights, a rear  spoiler and a power driver seat. Only Platinum offers the adaptive cruise  control option. A rear-seat entertainment system is available across the  lineup.",

    "full_description": "For 2017, the Toyota Corolla gets some front-end work done (including new LED headlights), upgraded interior upholstery, a standard rearview camera on all trims, and a bundle of safety features not usually found on a compact sedan. The Toyota  Corolla marked its 50th anniversary last year, a continuous production  milestone that places it alongside nameplates such as the Ford Mustang,  Chevrolet Corvette and Porsche 911. Toyota has sold 43 million Corollas,  through 11 generations, and claims it as the best-selling nameplate of all  time.  \nAnd yet  Toyota's small sedan still gets little respect from car critics. You'll often  see it described as a soulless appliance, a vanilla steel cage for transport  from point A to B. The 2017 Toyota Corolla doesn't make great strides in  changing that narrative, but there's still a lot to like. The Corolla's  interior has a fresh and stylish edge, an easy-to-use infotainment system, and  loads of rear legroom compared with most compact sedans. \nFor 2017,  the Corolla also makes a great leap with new safety features and driver aids on  all models, including a rearview camera, forward collision warning, lane  departure intervention and adaptive cruise control \u2014 features that  aren't commonly standard even on luxury sedans. Add the Corolla's high fuel  economy and great reputation for resale value, and you have all the ingredients  for a car that pleases more than it disappoints. \nBut keep  in mind that if you like cars with quick reflexes and that boost your mood on  an open road, the critics aren't wrong. Between its softly tuned suspension,  dull steering and \"just-enough\" power and speed, the Corolla is a bit  of a snooze behind the wheel. Other sedans including the Honda Civic and Mazda 3  are more fun to drive and similarly fuel-efficient. You can also get plenty of  value from the Hyundai Elantra and Kia Forte, while the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford  Focus and Volkswagen Golf are also strong all-around contenders.\nStill, the  2017 Corolla does the most important things well. It's not a flashy pick, but  it's a smart one, and it should serve you well in the years to come. All 2017  Toyota Corollas come standard with stability and traction control, antilock  brakes, front side airbags, side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag and a  passenger seat cushion airbag. A rearview camera is standard on all trims. \nAlso  standard on all 2017 trims is the Toyota Safety Sense P system, a bundle of  technology that includes forward collision warning and automatic emergency  braking, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with steering assist (to  nudge you back into your lane) and automatic high beams. \nNote that  most 2017 Corollas get rear drum brakes, with only the SE and XSE trims  upgraded to rear discs. In Edmunds brake testing, a Corolla LE Eco with the  rear drums stopped from 60 mph in 130 feet, a longer than average result. \nIn  government crash testing, the Corolla earned a top overall rating of five  stars, including five stars for front impacts and five stars for side impacts.  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the Corolla its top rating  of Good in the moderate-overlap front-impact, side-impact, roof strength and  head restraint (whiplash protection) tests. In the small-overlap front-impact  test, however, the Corolla received a Marginal score, the institute's  second-lowest.  If you're looking for a small sedan that covers the basics well, the 2017 Toyota Corolla is a smart choice. Several competitors deliver more thrills from the driver seat, but a sensible blend of space, fuel economy and value give the Corolla broad appeal. The  Corolla's four-cylinder engine is tried and true but pretty underwhelming.  Acceleration is adequate and not much more. The LE Eco's engine adds a few  horsepower, but not enough to notice. The CVT has computer-simulated  \"shifts\" to mitigate the constant rpm drone common to these types of  transmissions. That drone can rear its head, however, when you switch into  Sport mode. \nThe  Corolla's handling, too, is familiar. Sporty SE trim touches notwithstanding,  there's no real playfulness present. Any attempt at spirited driving on a  twisty road is met with lifeless steering and noticeable body roll. On the  upside, the Corolla is all about no-hassle commuting comfort. The ride is  compliant and shakes off most of what the road can throw at you. A floaty  luxury sedan it isn't, but for a compact car it's impressive. If that describes  your daily driving needs, the 2017 Toyota Corolla can make the daily grind seem  less onerous.  The  current Corolla's interior is certainly its nicest one to date, with a stylish  dashboard and un-Corolla-like flourishes like a sport-contoured steering wheel  and an eye-catching asymmetrical shifter surround. But ease of use remains the  priority, and rather than bury the most oft-summoned audio and climate  functions in touchscreen menus, the Corolla smartly uses traditional buttons  and dials for audio and climate functions.\nThat said,  the touchscreen, regardless of size, is a pleasant surprise. With large virtual  buttons, clear graphics, and quick response time to touch inputs, it's one of  the easier infotainment systems to use in the economy car class. The available  Entune App Suite integrates smartphone-connected services such as Bing,  Facebook, Yelp and Pandora, as well as real-time traffic data, but Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone app integration isn't available.\nThe  Corolla's front seats provide generally adequate comfort, particularly with the  firmer bolstering found in the SE and XSE seats, though some drivers might like  more lumbar support. Longer-legged drivers might also wish for more extension  from the telescoping steering wheel. \nThe  Corolla offers more rear legroom than most small sedans, if not a commensurate  amount of headroom, and the nearly flat floor makes the middle rear position  more livable. Trunk capacity is average at 13 cubic feet, but the wide trunk  opening facilitates loading and unloading.  \nStandard  equipment on the base L model includes 15-inch steel wheels, bi-LED headlights,  LED running lights, power mirrors, doors and locks, air-conditioning, adaptive  cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a six-way adjustable driver  seat and four-way front passenger seat, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, a  rearview camera, Bluetooth connectivity, and a six-speaker Entune audio system with 6.1-inch touchscreen, voice controls, a CD player, a USB  port, an auxiliary audio jack and, for iPhone users, the Siri Eyes Free voice  control system. The Corolla's extra safety features are detailed in our Safety  section.\nThe LE  adds 16-inch steel wheels, heated mirrors, variable intermittent wipers,  keyless entry, metallic cabin accents and automatic climate control.\nThe LE Eco  starts with the LE's features and adds engine and suspension tuning designed  for maximum fuel efficiency, 15-inch steel wheels with low-rolling-resistance  tires, a rear spoiler and enhanced aerodynamics. \nUpgrading  to the XLE gets you keyless ignition and entry, upgraded headlights, 16-inch  alloy wheels, a sunroof, simulated leather upholstery (Toyota's SofTex), heated  front seats, an upgraded driver information display, and the Entune Audio Plus  audio system that builds on the basic Entune features by adding a 7-inch  touchscreen display, satellite and HD radio, and an app-based navigation system  (Scout GPS Link).\nThe SE is  the sporty Corolla, although we use that term loosely. The SE builds on the  LE's features and can be had with either a continuously variable transmission  (CVT) or a six-speed manual transmission. The SE features 17-inch alloy wheels,  unique front-end styling with a black mesh grille, heated color-keyed side  mirrors with turn signal indicators, a rear spoiler, a chrome-tipped exhaust, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel with paddle shifters (for CVT models), sport  front seats, a sport-style gauge cluster and, for manual transmission models, a  sunroof, keyless ignition and entry, and the upgraded Entune audio system. \nThe XSE  takes the SE CVT features and adds a sunroof, keyless ignition and entry,  heated front seats and an eight-way power-adjustable driver seat. There's also  an SE 50th Anniversary edition that adds anniversary badging, gray-painted  17-inch wheels, and upgraded upholstery and trim with Black Cherry contrast  stitching. \nA few  options packages are also available. LE and LE Eco models can select the  Premium package, which adds 16-inch alloy wheels, bumper-integrated LED running  lights and Entune Audio Plus. A sunroof can be added to this package for LE models  (it's included with the package for LE Eco). \nThe  Premium package for SE CVT models includes Entune Audio Plus and a sunroof,  while XLE and XSE models can opt for Entune Premium Audio with an integrated  navigation system and the Entune App Suite. The 2017  Toyota Corolla comes with two versions of a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. In  all trims except the LE Eco, the engine makes 132 horsepower and 128 pound-feet  of torque. The LE Eco's engine uses a more sophisticated valvetrain to maximize  fuel efficiency and makes a little more power, with 140 hp and 126 lb-ft of  torque. \nMost  Corollas come with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The SE can be  optioned with a six-speed manual transmission, though. \nIn Edmunds  performance testing, a Corolla LE Eco accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 9.2  seconds. This is a about a second slower than many other small sedans. \nEPA-estimated  fuel economy is 30 mpg combined (27 city/35 highway) for the Corolla SE with  the manual transmission. CVT models with 16-inch wheels achieve 32 mpg combined  (28 city/36 highway); the larger 17-inch wheels extract a 1 mpg penalty at 31  mpg combined (28 city/35 highway). Topping the range is the LE Eco with 34 mpg  combined (30 city/40 highway) with 15-inch wheels and 33 combined (29 city/38  highway) with the 16-inch wheels. ",

    "full_description": "The 2015 Toyota Highlander is essentially unchanged. After last year's thorough redesign, the 2015 Toyota Highlander stays true to its no-nonsense roots. It remains a top choice in the three-row family crossover class. With so many people haulers out there, how do you know which  one is right for you? Well, let's start with your list of needs. Do you need  room for up to eight people? A comfortable and quiet ride? Good performance and  fuel economy? How about the option of rear seat DVD entertainment or even  occasionally towing up to 5,000 pounds? If this reads just like your short  list, then Toyota would like you to take a  look at the versatile Highlander crossover SUV. It's back after a thorough  redesign last year and better than ever.\nThe 2015 Toyota Highlander, now in its third generation, is  a top contender in this family-friendly crossover SUV segment. Tossing out  minivans and V8-powered toy box-hauling behemoths, the Highlander is likely the  sweet spot for most. Offered in front- or all-wheel drive with a choice of  four-cylinder or V6 engines, there are five distinct trim levels from which to  choose, each offering increasing amounts of content with few factory options.  This strategy makes the process of finding the right Highlander pretty easy.\nNo matter which one you're considering, know that you'll get  a comfortable cabin with plenty of room for your family and their things. The  Highlander's second row can be either a three-across bench or a double  captain's chair affair with a side table. The Highlander is also pleasant and  easy to drive, and with its refined V6 and smooth six-speed automatic, it's also  one of the quickest SUVs out there (even among V8s). If tech is your thing, there's  enough available high-end gear on the upper trim levels to keep you and your  co-pilot \"infotained\" for days on end.\nIn light of all these qualities, we awarded a top \"A\"  rating to the 2015 Toyota  Highlander. Of course, that's not to say that Toyota's crossover is  the best at absolutely everything. If you want a truly adult-friendly third row  with easier access, for example, the Ford  Flex would be a better bet. Another perennial favorite of ours is the Mazda  CX-9, which is more fun to drive and offers more cargo space as well. There's  also the handsome-looking V8-powered Dodge  Durango or the three-row Hyundai  Santa Fe, which stacks up nicely against the Highlander across the board. But  the Highlander has history and the Toyota nameplate on its side, and it's one  of our top picks for 2015. The base Highlander LE starts with front-wheel drive and a  2.7-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 185 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of  torque. The transmission is a six-speed automatic. Fuel  economy is an EPA-estimated 22 mpg combined (20 city/25 highway), but that's barely better than the ratings for the  stronger V6 engine.\nThat 3.5-liter V6 is optional on the LE and standard on all  other trims. It's rated at 270 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. The transmission is  again a six-speed automatic that may be mated to either front- or all-wheel  drive (Limited Platinum comes with standard AWD). The front-wheel-drive V6  configuration achieves an EPA-estimated 21 mpg combined (19 city/25 highway), while the AWD V6 drops a tick to 20 mpg combined (18 city/24 highway). We easily met these estimates when we recorded a  real-world 23 mpg on Edmunds' 120-mile mixed-driving evaluation loop in an XLE  AWD.\nAt the Edmunds test facility, we recorded a 7.3-second 0-60-mph  time in that same XLE AWD, which is about a second quicker than the average for  this segment. A Limited with front-wheel drive still outpaced most competitors  with a run to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds.\nThe four-cylinder Highlander LE is rated to tow up to 1,500  pounds. An LE or LE Plus V6 is rated up to 2,000 pounds. A properly equipped  Highlander XLE or Limited (with standard heavy-duty radiator, alternator and  supplemental oil cooler) can tow up to 5,000 pounds. The 2015 Toyota Highlander comes standard with traction and stability  control, antilock disc brakes, front seat side airbags, a driver knee airbag, a  front passenger seat-cushion airbag and full-length side curtain airbags. A  rearview camera is also standard.\nThe Limited trim gets a blind-spot monitoring system with  rear cross-traffic alert, and its optional Driver Technology package (standard  on Limited Platinum) adds a frontal collision warning and mitigation system  (with automatic braking), lane-departure warning and Toyota's Safety Connect telematics  (emergency assistance, stolen-vehicle location and automatic collision notification).  Unfortunately, these items are unavailable on lesser Highlander trims.\nIn a simulated panic stop from 60 mph conducted at the  Edmunds test facility, a Highlander XLE AWD managed a braking distance of 116  feet, a very good distance for this class.\nIn government crash testing, the Highlander received a  five-star overall rating (out of a possible five), with four stars for  total frontal impact protection and five stars for total side impact  protection. During testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the  Highlander received the highest  possible rating of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset,  side-impact and roof-strength tests. In the small-overlap frontal-offset impact  test, the Highlander received the second-highest rating of \"Acceptable.\"  Its seat and head restraint design was rated \"Good\" for whiplash  protection in rear impacts. Most 2015 Toyota Highlander buyers end up with the  tried-and-true V6 engine, and it's easy to see why: You get almost the same  fuel economy as with the base four-cylinder, along with an extra 85 hp and some  of the smoothest acceleration in any crossover at this price. The six-speed  automatic transmission works well and provides quick downshifts.\nThe meaty three-spoke steering wheel is precise, and if you  drive quickly around a tight turn, the Highlander remains secure, with a decent  amount of grip. As long as you're not looking for handling as athletic as the  Mazda CX-9's, you'll likely find the Highlander sharp enough. Of course, the  Highlander's bread and butter is ferrying passengers around in comfort, and  here it excels. The cabin remains hushed at speed, and road impacts are  generally shrugged off by the compliant suspension, though the Limited's  19-inch wheels don't do the ride any favors. Hard plastics that were once the bane of the Highlander have  since been supplanted by supple surfaces with fancy stitching at the seams. The  gauge cluster has a contemporary look thanks in part to the multifunction  information display that sits in the middle (especially the XLE and Limited's  larger color version). Although the base 6.1-inch central touchscreen is, well,  a bit basic in both form and function, the available 8-inch unit is more  satisfying with its improved graphics and functionality.\nToyota has baked a number of handy storage features into the  2015 Highlander's interior. There's a unique built-in shelf on the dashboard,  for instance, that can serve as a resting place for phones and other small  personal effects. The shelf's short height, however, can make it hard to fit  your hand in there to place or retrieve those items. Vastly more spacious is  the storage box under the console armrest that's big enough for a large purse.\nIf you're expecting big-time space in the way back, we  should warn you that adults will still find it cramped relative to some rivals.  Kids will be fine, though, and the three-across seating bolsters the Highlander's  credentials as a minivan substitute. On the cargo-carrying front, the available  height-adjustable power liftgate with memory height settings is a boon in  garages with low ceilings. Maximum hauling capacity tops out at 83.7 cubic  feet, which is an average figure for this class of vehicle. \nThe base LE gets things started with 18-inch alloy wheels,  automatic headlights, heated exterior mirrors, privacy glass, a rear spoiler,  cruise control, a rearview camera, fabric seating, manually adjustable front  seats (six-way driver, four-way passenger), a sliding and reclining 60/40-split  second-row seat, a 60/40-split third-row seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a 6.1-inch central touchscreen  and a six-speaker audio system with voice control, a CD player, an auxiliary audio  jack and an iPod/USB interface.\nPicking the LE Plus adds foglights, a flip-up rear hatch  window, an adjustable-height power liftgate, tri-zone automatic climate  control, upgraded upholstery with synthetic leather (SofTex) accents, an  eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar), a leather-wrapped steering wheel,  satellite radio and HD radio.\nThe XLE further adds a sunroof, roof rails, keyless entry  and ignition, leather upholstery for the first and second rows (SofTex for the  third), an upgraded driver information display, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, a 110-volt power outlet in the second row, retractable second-row  sunshades, driver voice amplification for communicating with rear passengers (Driver  Easy Speak), an 8-inch central touchscreen, a navigation system and smartphone  app integration (Entune App  Suite).\nNearing the top, the Limited comes with 19-inch wheels, LED  running lights, LED ambient interior lighting, second-row captain's chairs, heated  and ventilated front seats, driver memory functions, a four-way power passenger  seat, a blind-spot monitoring system, rear cross-traffic alerts, rear parking  sensors and a 12-speaker JBL  audio system.\nThere are no factory options available for the LE or LE Plus  trim levels. The XLE can be outfitted with the second-row captain's chairs. An  optional rear seat entertainment package for the XLE and Limited includes a  Blu-ray player with 9-inch display, RCA jacks and wireless headphones.\nOn just the Limited you can also select the Driver Technology  package, which fits the Highlander with automatic high-beam control headlights,  adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, frontal collision warning, a frontal  impact crash mitigation system (with automatic braking) and Toyota's Safety  Connect telematics (emergency assistance, stolen vehicle location and automatic  collision notification).\nFinally, the top-shelf Highlander Limited Platinum reaps all  of the above as standard and further includes a panoramic sunroof, a heated  steering wheel and heated second-row seats.",

    "full_description": "After  more than two decades off the market, Toyota finally released the newest  version of its preeminent sports car \u2014 now dubbed the GR Supra  \u2014 for the 2020 model year. After taking the GR Supra to our track and  subjecting it to instrument testing, we praised its rapid acceleration, quick  steering and sublime handling.   Now  Toyota is widening the Supra's appeal. For 2021, Toyota is adding an  entry-level trim level \u2014 the Supra 2.0 \u2014 that comes with a  255-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine to join the existing  turbocharged inline-six. Buyers set on the six-cylinder Supra 3.0 will be  rewarded with an increase of nearly 50 hp. It now thumps out 382 hp and further  gains revised suspension tuning to help it be more buttoned-down and confident  both on and off the track. There's also a new limited-edition A91 appearance  package with racy carbon-fiber bits, special graphics and a unique paint color. Read our Expert Rating below for the full breakdown on all the Supra's hits and misses. While  the base 2.0-liter model and the more powerful 3.0-liter Supra are certainly  entertaining, we recommend the midlevel 3.0  Premium trim. On top of the standard 3.0 equipment, the Premium adds a  center touchscreen, smartphone compatibility, and a number of desirable  features such as heated seats and leather upholstery. How does the GR Supra drive? The Supras of the past were more about straight-line speed than nimble handling, but this latest incarnation succeeds at both. In Edmunds testing, our Supra in Premium trim rocketed to 60 mph in a quick 4.4 seconds. A power bump for 2021 makes traction off the line a bit more scarce but improves the Supra's top end by a noticeable margin.    Around turns, the steering wheel communicates a fair amount of information from the front tires to your hands, and the revised tuning makes it respond more naturally. The revised suspension is also better at retaining grip but feels no less lively, meaning better cornering and less of an immediate tendency to oversteer. The brakes and sticky tires can haul the Supra to a stop from 60 mph in just 105 feet, though for heavier use, like track driving, it would probably benefit from upgraded brake pads. The Supra isn't strictly a weekend car, however. It's something you can drive with little effort every day. How comfortable is the GR Supra? The seats provide excellent support, but you might find them a bit confining around your shoulders. It's not too noticeable when driving at speed, but it's apparent when cruising around. The leather upholstery isn't perforated, so its breathability isn't great. The ride quality is firm but not harsh. Because you sit so close to the rear axle, big vertical movements feel more pronounced.    We wouldn't call this a quiet cabin since there's a fair amount of road and wind noise, but it's not unpleasantly loud either. It lets in the right amount of induction noise and exhaust burbles when you're driving in Sport mode. As for the climate control system, there's no obvious way to sync its two zones, which is odd. It could stand to be a tick stronger at max fan speed too. How\u2019s the interior? Those familiar with BMW's older iDrive system will feel right at home with the Supra's infotainment. But if you're a first-time user, you'll need to get acquainted with the system's menu layout. All other controls are pretty straightforward.     The Supra's doors are a little shorter than average and fairly light. Even if you're of average height, you may need to watch your head, but at least the seat bolsters don't impede access. In general, spaciousness is not this car's greatest strength. The Porsche Cayman and BMW M2, for example, do a better job of making a cockpit feel roomy. How\u2019s the tech? The navigation system is pretty good at understanding natural language commands, and it locates specific points of interest without an address. It's easy to use the voice commands to set up your route. Our test Supra had the 12-speaker premium audio system. The audio quality is fine, but it lacks the fullness we'd expect for an upgrade system. As for integration, there's one USB port, an optional wireless charger and wireless Apple CarPlay. Android Auto is now offered.    The Supra's adaptive cruise control is optional, and it works effectively. It's more aggressive than most systems and can keep a small gap between you and the car ahead if you want it to. It also works all the way down to a stop. Lane keeping assist isn't quite as effective. It'll mitigate lane crossing but doesn't really keep you centered. How\u2019s the storage? Sports cars are usually compromised when it comes to cargo space, and the Supra is no exception. The Supra has less trunk space (10.2 cubic feet) than the Porsche Cayman and the BMW M2. There is a cargo pass-through to the cabin that you can use when hauling longer items. But you'll have to rest those items on the rear-suspension tower brace.     The small-item storage space is even more deficient in the cabin. The cupholders are located where an armrest bin would typically be. And if you store drinks in them, they will interfere with operating the infotainment system controls. A wireless device charging pad is standard on Premium models and up, but plus-size phones won't really fit in it. The door pockets and glovebox are also small. How\u2019s the fuel economy? Fuel efficiency is not an area we expected the Supra to shine in, but shine it does. It returns an EPA-estimated 26 mpg combined (24 city/31 highway). In our testing, we observed an impressive 29 mpg on our 115-mile evaluation loop. This matches what we observed in 2020 Supra even though this newer model gains 47 additional horsepower. This also trounces the BMW M2 Competition (20 mpg combined) and even outperforms the base-model Porsche Cayman (24 mpg combined). Is the GR Supra a good value? The Supra's cabin looks more BMW than Toyota, but it's still a pleasant space that delivers a luxury-level look and feel. The carbon-fiber trim that's included in all six-cylinder cars is a nice touch, and it helps make the Supra seem a bit more special than your average coupe. Even if you buy the base-level Supra with the four-cylinder, you're getting a heck of a bargain.    Toyota's warranty coverage is a trade-off compared to competitors. There's less bumper-to-bumper coverage but better powertrain coverage. Two years of scheduled maintenance is also included. The new Supra mostly delivers on its promises. Sure, there is a lot of obvious BMW DNA here, but that doesn't make it any less of a car if you value performance and swoopy styling. The Supra's appeal is undeniable for the price. It's properly quick and lively, yet it's also mostly comfortable enough to be your daily driver so long as you don't need to take much with you or spend a lot of time on bad roads.",

    "full_description": "The  Toyota Sienna is one of the most recognizable minivans on the market. This is  due in no small part to the \"Swagger Wagon\" ads that defined the  last-generation model early in its life cycle. Though the quirky marketing  \u2014 and Toyota's reputation for above-average reliability \u2014  helped carry the previous Sienna for nearly a decade, a new minivan would need  more than a rapping family to connect with modern buyers. Enter the redesigned  2021 Sienna. Clearly,  Toyota thinks fuel economy is one way to stand out. Gone is last year's  3.5-liter V6; in its place is a hybrid powertrain that uses a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine. It's essentially the same system that Toyota uses in its  RAV4 Hybrid and Highlander Hybrid, and it produces 245 horsepower. That's a far  cry from the outgoing model's 296 hp. But in return you get an EPA-estimated 36  mpg in combined driving. The  rest of the 2021's Sienna's changes are more evolutionary, with improved  technology features and a new center console design that's more like a SUV's.  The Sienna's biggest competitors \u2014 the Honda Odyssey and Chrysler  Pacifica \u2014 are both excellent thanks to their clever and usable  interiors, comfortable rides and wide array of features. The Sienna comes up  short in a few areas \u2014 check out our Expert Rating for the details  \u2014 but overall it's a solid pick. The  base LE trim comes relatively well equipped, but we suggest stepping up a tier  to the XLE trim. It adds more  features and opens up the options list to include things that aren't available  on the LE. How does the Sienna drive? The Sienna's hybrid-only powertrain means it's ultra smooth to accelerate but also a lot slower than its peers, taking an extra second to reach 60 mph compared to most other vans (including the outgoing Sienna with a V6). This slower acceleration isn't evident when you're just cruising around town. But you'll notice it when you're merging onto the highway or going up grades.     The Sienna isn't the most nimble minivan in the class, but it holds its own. It drives more like a car than an SUV. The steering is weighted well to cruise for hours down the highway. It's also light and easy to turn during low-speed maneuvers.    Emergency braking performance is OK, but the bigger deal is the pedal's sometimes awkward grabby feel. That can make it hard to consistently stop smoothly. How comfortable is the Sienna? We had no complaints after spending hours in the driver's seat. Its wide range of adjustability gets much of the credit, though this is a common feature in the class. Optional ottoman-style footrests in the second row plus a huge range of fore-aft sliding create a business-class-like feel and give the Sienna an edge in second-row comfort. Optional four-zone climate control is one more zone than competitors have (three-zone is standard) and is effective at keeping the cabin cozy, hot or cold.    Noise is an area of concern. So long as the engine isn't working hard, the cabin is quiet, even serene. When you ask for power, the whole cabin will know. The engine and CVT drone considerably. Optional in-car voice projection, which sends front passenger voices through the rear speakers and headsets, helps as a work-around. You can save the shouting for when you really need it. How\u2019s the interior? The Sienna pulls ahead of the pack in this area. It sits at a height that makes it easy to slide in and out of. The driving position is excellent and versatile. We're fans of the large central touchscreen with two exceptions: the glare that it throws off in midday sun and some far-side buttons that feel a bit out of reach. All other primary controls are placed logically and function as expected.    There's naturally good visibility out of the cabin. An optional surround-view camera system can provide a see-through view of the Sienna to make things even easier. There's also a digital rearview mirror that solves the issue of seeing past headrests or high-piled cargo in the back. The sliding doors and rear hatch have a no-touch open and closing feature. Just swipe your foot to operate them. How\u2019s the tech? The infotainment system uses a combination of a quick-responding touchscreen and physical buttons. The redundancy lets you choose your preference for menu access. The native navigation is accurate and easy to read, and the system's voice commands respond well to natural language. Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration is also standard.    Interior tech features worth mentioning include a handy cabin intercom system, Wi-Fi connectivity and a generous number of USB ports for all three rows. We found the advanced driving aids to be excellent too. Adaptive cruise control is tuned well to avoid the heavy and sudden brake application we see from some other brands. How\u2019s the storage? All minivans are masters of utility, and the Sienna is no exception. There's a deep well for cargo storage behind the third row that also has hooks on the seatback. The third row can be manually folded and stows almost flat into the floor, and the second-row seats slide far forward, offering a great cargo solution. One big drawback is the second-row seats aren't removable as they are in other minivans, which greatly reduces the maximum cargo capacity.    Storage for personal items is equally good. There are 16 cupholders, multi-level door pockets, and a large shelf between the front passengers that is perfect for a handbag. For car seats, the attachment points are extremely easy to access. There are four in the seven-passenger Sienna and five in the eight-passenger. Buckles are easy for booster-age kids to use. How\u2019s the fuel economy? Chrysler gave us the first plug-in minivan. If you ran out of EV charge, its hybrid mode still returned an EPA-estimated 30 mpg. That was mind-blowing minivan fuel economy at the time. But the new hybrid Sienna is rated by the EPA at 36 mpg combined (36 city/36 highway). And as we discovered, it's capable of much more.     After nearly 500 miles with a front-wheel-drive Sienna, we vastly outperformed the EPA estimates. We averaged 42.7 mpg overall, including 44.8 mpg on our mixed-driving evaluation route of just over 115 miles. We can't wait to see if the all-wheel-drive version performs as well. Wow. Is the Sienna a good value? Our Sienna test vehicle wasn't a final production unit, but it felt really well built and was free of squeaks and rattles. Surfaces that are frequently touched \u2014 steering wheel, armrests, etc. \u2014 are soft-touch and well padded. All these aspects add to the general upscale sense you get from this interior.    Though a base Sienna starts a bit higher than other base models, it's comparably priced when its peers are equipped with features to match. The top trim is a tad more expensive but offers value-added features such as all-wheel drive that some competitors don't. It has a strong warranty for hybrid components and roadside assistance and is the only one to offer two years of free scheduled maintenance. For those who prioritize how a car drives, the Sienna's brakes may be a deal-breaker. Sometimes they grab too much, sometimes too little, and sometimes they work fine. This factor carries a lot of weight for us and is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise great minivan.    That aside, the Sienna gets a lot of the fundamentals right and offers some bonus elements too. Its exterior styling certainly shows more personality than any other minivan. And some of its more novel interior features include a built-in vacuum, a refrigerator that gets legitimately cold for drinks and snacks, and second-row seats that recline with footrests like you're in an airline business class. Oh, and we've seen this hybrid get well over 40 mpg. That's a wild card if we've ever seen one.",

    "full_description": "Shopping  for a full-size truck can be a challenge. Though there are only a few models to  choose from, deciding which is best can be daunting. Toyota's offering for  consumers is the 2018 Tundra. Some shoppers will undoubtedly appreciate the  Tundra's V8-only powertrains, and others will enjoy the relatively  straightforward ordering process compared to domestic rivals. And though the  Tundra doesn't have a wealth of bells and whistles to choose from, it does have  appealing core competencies. It can tow more than 10,000 pounds and is quite  capable on the occasional off-road trip. But  rival full-size trucks have all benefited from recent overhauls, and the Tundra  hasn't seen an all-new revision since 2007, which means the 2018 Tundra lags in  advancements compared to the current segment leaders. Most manufacturers offer  a diesel engine option for efficiency and torque over long hauls or  turbocharged gasoline engines for superior performance and fuel efficiency.  Even suspension technology has increased such that most rival trucks ride more  comfortably.Ultimately,  the made-in-America 2018 Toyota Tundra has its share of good qualities, but  it's not enough to push it to the top of the full-size truck category this  year. The 2018 Toyota Tundra is certainly a competent truck. It'll tow and haul just about anything you throw at it, and it's plenty capable off-road. But the Tundra is also getting dated, and it shows up in its lack of refinement and middling fuel economy. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the Toyota Tundra CrewMax 1794 Edition (5.7L  V8 | 6-speed automatic | 4WD). NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Tundra has received some revisions,  including an upgraded infotainment system and new driver safety aids. Our  findings remain applicable to this year's Tundra, however. The Tundra's 5.7-liter V8 hauled our 5,872-pound test truck to 60 mph in 6.8 seconds, which is about as quick as most competitors. The six-speed automatic never hunts for gears in Drive and offers full manual control. Consistent, powerful braking is a Tundra strength. Brake feel is good, and our testing shows the truck's brakes are more than sufficient. The Tundra has steering that is accurate enough to place the truck precisely. The turning circle, at 44 feet, is respectable for a truck this long. As truck handling goes, the Tundra isn't bad, but it is big, which can make it uncomfortable on small roads. It will manage, but you'll need to take your time, place it carefully and pay attention to lane discipline. Ample torque and low gearing mean the Tundra is jumpy off the line if you're not careful. But we quickly adjusted to the truck's power delivery. A manual shift option is useful for engine braking and gear holding. The Tundra's automatic limited-slip differential and availability of the TRD Off-Road package give the truck genuine off-road capability. Seat adjustability in the 1794 edition includes a 12-way adjustable power driver seat with power thigh and lumbar adjustability. Both front seats are heated and ventilated. But overall comfort is only average. Because Toyota pairs stiff springs for towing with the 5.7-liter engine, there's no getting away from the Tundra's stiff ride, which is a shame. Driving around town, you'll constantly be reminded that your truck is capable of towing a small RV. Typical of Toyota trucks, the Tundra is loud when it's first started (fan noise, mostly), but it's also rather noisy even during cruising. Engine racket during acceleration isn't overly obtrusive, though. Climate and audio controls are within easy reach. Four-wheel-drive Tundras are, like most 4x4 trucks, tall, which makes entry and exit awkward. The large, wide-opening doors help. The optional running boards are definitely worth the money. The upshot of being huge is having lots of space. That's the case in the Tundra. The CrewMax cab is absolutely massive in the back. Three adults easily fit. Front visibility and rear-quarter visibility are adequate from the driver seat. A standard rearview camera works wonders in tight parking situations. Parking sensors, included on upper trims, helps in close-quarters situations. High-quality leather and simulated suede covers the seats and interior pieces, giving the Tundra an upscale look. Small details, including a poor-fitting trim piece on the steering wheel, keep the Tundra from scoring higher. The Tundra utilizes its space well. There's a massive center console big enough for multiple average-size laptops. The door pockets are large and fitted for large drink containers. The Tundra's tow ratings are generally lower than key competitors'. The Tundra is equipped with Toyota's Entune system, which when combined with an app on your phone, allows you to integrate various systems. It's OK, but rival infotainment systems are easier to use. Picking  a Tundra is all about what kind of truck you need and the features you want.  But if you're having a hard time choosing, maybe go with the SR5 model with the TRD Off-Road package with options (the one that includes the SR5 upgrade package) for off-road parts  that won't interfere with its towing and hauling capabilities.  Highlights for the base SR (Double  Cab body only) include 18-inch steel wheels, heated mirrors, a windshield wiper  de-icer, a damped tailgate, a rearview camera, an integrated trailer brake  controller, a tilt-only steering wheel, Bluetooth, a 6.1-inch touchscreen  interface, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player and a USB port. Also  included is forward collision warning and mitigation (with automatic braking),  lane departure warning, automatic high beams and adaptive cruise control. Going with the SR5 gets you  foglights, variable intermittent windshield wipers and an upgraded tech  interface that includes a 7-inch touchscreen, HD and satellite radio, traffic  information and a navigation app. The crew cab adds a power-opening rear window  and an overhead console. The  SR5's Upgrade package adds front bucket seats with a power-adjustable driver  seat, a center console (with storage and console shifter), a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a  larger 38-gallon gas tank when equipped with the 5.7-liter V8. There's also a  TRD Sport package that adds 20-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, a hood  scoop, body-colored mirrors and bumpers, LED headlights and foglights, TRD  shift knob, floor mats and graphics. The Limited builds on the Upgrade  options package equipment with 20-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights,  movable tie-down cleats, automatic dual-zone climate control, leather  upholstery, an upgraded power driver seat and a power-adjustable passenger  seat, a power horizontal-sliding rear window (extended cab), a navigation  system and additional stereo speakers. At the top of the heap, the Platinum trim  level comes with distinctive styling elements, LED daytime running lights,  power-folding and auto-dimming mirrors, a sunroof, heated and ventilated front  seats, driver-seat memory functions and a 12-speaker JBL sound system. The 1794 Edition really only differs  from the Platinum in terms of its exclusive exterior and interior styling  elements. A TRD Off-Road package can be added to the SR5, Limited and 1794 Edition. It  includes 18-inch TRD wheels, off-road tires, LED headlights, trail-tuned shock  absorbers, skid plates and tow hooks.",

    "full_description": "The 2014 Highlander is fully redesigned. Highlights include improved interior quality, available eight-passenger seating, a height-adjustable power liftgate and a six-speed automatic transmission for V6 models. The reinvented three-row 2014 Toyota Highlander progresses in key areas while staying true to its no-nonsense roots. It's a top choice in the family crossover class. With all the family-friendly crossovers on the market these  days, it's a full-time job just keeping them straight. So allow us to make your  job a little easier. The 2014 Toyota Highlander is the granddaddy of this  segment, and it's back this year with a whole new bag of tricks. A decade and a  half ago, the original Camry-based Highlander became the first vehicle to blend  the versatility of a midsize SUV with the ride and handling of a sedan. Now, facing  a legion of tough rivals, the all-new, third-generation 2014 Highlander is out to  regain its edge.\nTruth be told, the second-generation Highlander was still a stud  when Toyota put  it out to pasture last year. We even called it an \"ideal choice\" in  some respects, which is high praise indeed for a family hauler on its farewell  tour. But that doesn't mean there wasn't room for improvement. In particular,  the hard plastic dashboard failed to impress at this price point, as did the unremarkable  technology features it housed. Also, the Highlander's rear accommodations had  begun to feel a bit cramped by midsize crossover standards, especially in the  third row. A reinvention wasn't strictly necessary, but signs of aging were  increasingly apparent.\nTake a look at the 2014 Highlander and it's apparent that the  rest of the segment may now be playing catch-up. The new dashboard is a welcome  addition, as Toyota has ditched the generic hard panels in favor of supple  surfaces with artful curves. A larger 8-inch touchscreen is available, while  desirable add-ons like adaptive cruise control help bring the options list up  to date. Thanks to an extra 3.7 inches of width in the third row, there are now  three seats back there instead of two, making the Highlander one of the few  crossovers in this class with room for eight. The driving experience has been  refined, too, with reduced cabin noise and a responsive new six-speed automatic  transmission for the faultless V6 engine.\nIn light of all these improvements, we awarded a top \"A\"  grade in our 2014 Toyota Highlander rating.  Of course, that's not to say that Toyota's redesigned crossover is the best at absolutely  everything. If you want a truly adult-friendly third row, for example, the 2014 Ford Flex would  be a better bet. Another perennial favorite of ours is the 2014 Mazda CX-9,  which is more fun to drive and offers more cargo space as well. There's also  the handsome-looking and sportier 2014 Dodge Durango or the three-row 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe,  which stacks up nicely against the Highlander across the board.\nBut the Highlander has history and the Toyota nameplate on  its side, and it's better than ever for 2014. Here's how you remember the  all-new Highlander: It's the one that got this whole party started, and now it's  the latest three-row crossover to raise the bar. The base Highlander LE starts with front-wheel drive and a  2.7-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 185 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of  torque. The transmission is a six-speed automatic. Fuel economy is rated at an  unimpressive 22 mpg  combined (20 mpg city/25 mpg highway): barely better than the much stronger  V6.\nOptional on the LE and standard on all other trims is a 3.5-liter  V6 engine, rated at 270 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque in this application. The  transmission is again a six-speed automatic, but you can specify either front-  or all-wheel drive. The front-wheel-drive V6 configuration is rated at 21 mpg  combined (19 mpg city/25 mpg highway), while the AWD V6 drops a tick to 20 mpg  combined (18 mpg city/24 mpg highway). At the Edmunds test facility, we  recorded a 7.3-second 0-60-mph time for an XLE AWD, which is about a second  quicker than the average for this large crossover SUV segment.\nA properly equipped Highlander V6 can tow up to 5,000 pounds. The 2014 Toyota Highlander comes standard with traction and stability  control, antilock disc brakes, front-seat side airbags, a driver knee airbag, a  front passenger seat-cushion airbag and full-length side curtain airbags. A  rearview camera is also standard. In a simulated panic stop from 60 mph at the  Edmunds test facility, a Highlander XLE AWD managed a braking distance of 116  feet, a very good distance for this class. The brake pedal has a squishier feel  than we'd like, but this won't be a deal breaker for most buyers.\nThe Limited trim gets a blind-spot monitoring system with  rear cross-traffic alert, and its optional Driver Technology package adds a  frontal collision warning and mitigation system (with automatic braking), lane-departure  warning and Toyota's Safety Connect telematics (emergency assistance, stolen  vehicle location and automatic collision notification). Unfortunately, these  items are unavailable on lesser Highlander trims.\nIn government crash tests, the 2014 Toyota Highlander earned  a rating  of five stars overall, with four stars in frontal crash tests and rollover  tests and five stars in side crash testing. In crash testing by the Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety, the Highlander received the highest possible rating  of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and  roof-strength tests. In the small-overlap frontal-offset test, the Highlander  received the second-highest rating of \"Acceptable.\" Its seat/head  restraint design was rated \"Good\" for whiplash protection in rear  impacts. On the road, the first thing we noticed is that the 2014  Highlander feels longer and wider -- which, to be fair, it is (by about 3  inches and half an inch, respectively). Whereas the previous Highlander drove  much like a tall Camry, the new one feels more broad-of-beam. Nonetheless, the  meaty three-spoke steering wheel inspires confidence, and if you drive quickly  around a tight turn, the Highlander remains secure, with plenty of grip. As  long as you're not looking for handling as confident as the Mazda CX-9's, you'll  likely find the Highlander sharp enough.\nOf course, the Highlander's bread and butter is ferrying  passengers around in comfort, and here it excels. The cabin remains hushed at  speed, and road impacts are generally shrugged off by the compliant suspension,  though the Limited's 19-inch wheels don't do the ride any favors. Most Toyota  Highlander buyers end up with the tried-and-true V6 engine, and it's easy to  see why: You get almost the same fuel economy as with the base four-cylinder,  along with an extra 85 hp and some of the smoothest acceleration in any crossover  at this price. The new six-speed automatic transmission is a notable upgrade  over the old five-speed automatic, providing quick, precise downshifts that  make the 2014 Toyota Highlander feel quicker than it is. Perceived cabin quality wasn't a strength of the  previous-generation Highlander, but Toyota has made amends. Gone are the bland  hard plastics that used to cover the dashboard, supplanted by supple surfaces with  fancy stitching at the seams. The gauge cluster has a more contemporary look  than before, thanks in part to the multifunction information display that sits  in the middle (especially the XLE and Limited's larger color version). Although  the base 6.1-inch central touchscreen is, well, a bit basic in both form and  function, the newly available 8-inch unit is more satisfying with its improved  graphics and functionality.\nToyota has baked a number of handy storage features into the  2014 Highlander's interior. There's a unique shelf on the dashboard, for  instance, that's a perfect resting place for phones, with a hole in the bottom that  lets you feed in cords from the power point below. Also, the storage box under  the console armrest is much more spacious than before, providing what Toyota  describes as enough room for a large purse (hopefully \"murses\" fit as  well, since the Highlander's styling is said to be manlier this time around).\nRegrettably, the previous Highlander's slick 40/20/40-split  second-row seat with its removable center seat has been discontinued, so there's  only the standard 60/40-split bench seat and the available captain's chairs. On  the bright side, those second-row seats slide farther forward now, permitting  easier access to the third row. If you're expecting big-time space in the way  back, we should warn you that adults will still find it cramped relative to  some rivals. Kids will be fine, though, and the three-across seating bolsters  the Highlander's credentials as a minivan substitute. The XLE and Limited also  have a neat feature that allows you to use the Bluetooth microphone to  broadcast your voice to people seated in the rear through the Highlander's  speakers. Now you can say, \"I'm turning around right now if you guys don't  cut it out!\" all you want without craning your neck.\nOn the cargo-carrying front, the new height-adjustable power  liftgate with memory height settings (standard on LE Plus trims and higher) is  a boon in garages with low ceilings. Maximum hauling capacity has dropped to 83.7  cubic feet, however, from the previous generation's robust 95.4 cubes. The new  Highlander does offer 13.8 cubes behind the third-row seat, which beats last  year's 10.3. \nThe base LE gets things started with 18-inch alloy wheels,  automatic headlights, heated exterior mirrors, a rear spoiler, cruise control,  a rearview camera, a height-adjustable driver seat, a sliding and reclining 60/40-split  second-row seat, a 60/40-split third-row seat, Bluetooth phone  and audio connectivity, a 6.1-inch central touchscreen and a six-speaker CD sound  system with an auxiliary audio jack and an iPod/USB interface.\nPicking the LE Plus gets you foglights, a flip-up rear hatch  window, an adjustable-height power liftgate, tri-zone automatic climate  control, upgraded upholstery with synthetic leather (\"SofTex\")  accents, an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar), a leather-wrapped steering  wheel, satellite radio and HD radio.\nThe XLE boasts 18-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof, roof rails,  keyless entry/ignition, leather upholstery for the first and second rows  (SofTex for the third), an upgraded driver information display, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, a 110-volt power outlet in the second row, retractable  second-row sunshades, driver voice amplification for communicating with rear  passengers (\"Driver Easy Speak\"), an 8-inch central touchscreen and  the Entune App Suite with  mobile-app integration (compatible smartphone required).\nFinally, the top-shelf Limited comes packed with 19-inch  wheels, LED running lights, ambient interior lighting, heated and ventilated  front seats, driver memory functions, a four-way power passenger seat, dual  second-row captain's chairs with a table in between, a blind-spot monitoring  system with rear cross-traffic alerts, rear parking sensors and a 12-speaker JBL audio system.\nThe Limited offers two exclusive options packages. The  Driver Technology package includes automatic high-beam control, adaptive cruise  control, a collision mitigation system with automatic braking, a lane-departure  warning system and Toyota's Safety  Connect telematics. The Platinum package starts with the Driver Technology package  and adds a panoramic sunroof, a heated steering wheel and heated second-row  captain's chairs.\nOptional on both the XLE and Limited is a rear-seat  entertainment system with a 9-inch display and a Blu-ray player. As noted, the  XLE is also eligible for the second-row captain's chairs, though if you want  them to be heated, the Limited's the only way to go. There are no factory  options on the LE and LE Plus.",

    "full_description": "Not  everybody needs the size and capabilities of a full-size pickup. That's where  midsize trucks come in, and the 2021 Toyota Tacoma is one of the better choices  in the class. It trails behind the more city-friendly Honda Ridgeline and  all-terrain Jeep Gladiator in our rankings, but we think the Tacoma is a  sensible middle ground between the two. It also feels a little more refined  than rivals from Chevrolet, Ford and GMC.  \nAfter  last year's significant refresh, there are no changes to the core Tacoma offerings.  There are, however, a pair of new limited-edition trims for buyers looking for  something a little different. The Trail Special Edition is based on the near  entry-level SR5 trim with the double-cab body style. Limited to 7,000 units, it  comes with all-terrain tires and lockable bed storage bins. The driver's side  bin is even insulated so it can function as a built-in cooler. There's also a  Nightshade Special Edition based on the more expensive Limited trim, but  changes are only aesthetic, with blacked-out badging and trim throughout. Just  5,000 are planned for production.\nIs  the Tacoma the right midsize truck for you? Check out our Expert Rating to get  our in-depth take on the 2021Tacoma.\nWhat's it like to live with?\nWhen the Tacoma was redesigned in 2016, we wanted to know  what it was like to live with, so we bought one. Specifically, we purchased the  2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road and lived with it in our long-term fleet for  nearly two years, putting over 40,000 miles on the odometer. The Tacoma has  received some updates since its redesign in 2016, but it's the same generation  truck so most of our observations apply. To learn about everything from seat  comfort to reliability, check out all the details in our long-term Tacoma test. The  midtier TRD Sport and Off-Road are quite appealing. They both add plenty of  features and offer a diverse options list. Of the two, the TRD Off-Road is our pick. It enhances the truck's off-road ability  while keeping the cost reasonable. While the deletion of the airdam comes with  a slight fuel economy penalty, we think it's offset by the more comfortable  ride provided by the smaller wheels and Bilstein shocks. How does the Tacoma drive? The Tacoma steers and handles smoothly and is generally easy to drive. The main exception is the brakes, which feel grabby and can induce nosedive in hard stops. We do wish the 3.5-liter V6 felt a bit more willing, but there is enough power for daily use. The transmission shifts predictably and is able to get the most out of the engine.\n\n   Off-road is where the Tacoma truly shines and stands above all others except the Gladiator. The Tacoma has the clearance, gearing and traction to tackle serious terrain, and the brakes and throttle prove brilliantly precise and controllable in low-range crawling situations. How comfortable is the Tacoma? The Tacoma was never a disagreeable truck to ride in, but changes introduced in 2020 made it a little bit more pleasant. A fully adjustable 10-way driver's seat comes standard in V6 trucks, and this seat promotes long-range comfort for drivers of almost all shapes and sizes. \n\n   The thicker side-window glass cuts down the wind noise compared to prior years, though the Colorado and the Ridgeline still have an edge here. The same is true for ride quality since the Tacoma is still truckier than its smoothest-riding competitors. As for the climate system, it has effective heating and cooling and is easy to adjust. How\u2019s the interior? The Tacoma's main drawback is its tallish step-in height. Get past that and everything else is solid once you're inside. The controls are logical and straightforward, including the large infotainment screen and the recently redesigned knobs and physical shortcut buttons. \n\n   The 10-way power seat provides a greater range of adjustability than in pre-2020 models, but we wish the telescoping steering wheel pulled out more. The front-seat roominess benefits from the seat's added downward adjustability, but other dimensions remain the same as before. Visibility is very good thanks to the profile of the hood, ample side windows, and a forward- and side-looking camera system. How\u2019s the tech? The latest Tacoma is pretty well stocked with tech features. Toyota introduced a new screen in 2020 that featured a larger size, crisper map graphics and quicker responses than in previous models. You also get Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and even Amazon Alexa. Built-in navigation is an inexpensive upgrade option, and it's probably worth getting if you're planning on venturing out of cellphone range a lot. \n\n   Toyota's approach to standard active safety tech is admirable. Adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, automatic high-beam control, and even a driver drowsiness warning system are all standard on all grades. How are the towing and storage? The Tacoma's truck bed is ideal. It's made of a composite material that needs no bedliner, and it has an enviable combination of fixed and movable tie-downs. Loading is easy because the tailgate opens low and its bedsides aren't comically tall. With a 6,800-pound maximum tow rating, the Tacoma does lag behind some others, but the deficit isn't large. \n\n   Interior storage for small items is adequate. Folding the rear seats down into their cargo-carrying position is a little fussy, but as a result it offers better storage space than all but the Ridgeline and the Gladiator. Installing child safety seats is easy, but larger rear-facing and infant seats might eat into front passenger room. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The 3.5-liter V6 engine and six-speed automatic combo earns 20 mpg combined (18 city/22 highway) in 4WD trim and 21 mpg combined in rear-wheel-drive models. Our testing leads us to believe that these ratings are achievable and accurate. \n\n   We tested a 2016 TRD 4WD Off-Road for more than a year and averaged 18.6 mpg over 40,000 miles of use. We were able to exceed the highway rating on several road trips, and there are good reasons why our truck may have come up just over 1 mpg short. Our home-base location skews the mix toward city driving, and the TRD Off-Road has knobbier tires and lacks the front airdam that comes on most Tacomas. Is the Tacoma a good value? You get a lot of well-built truck and a bed with many standard cargo-handling and safety features for your money. The value equation is particularly good on the TRD models. Build quality is solid, and Toyota trucks are known for their mechanical durability. Although warranty coverage isn't generous, you do get two years of free scheduled maintenance. Toyota's Tacoma manages to deliver fun in a right-size pickup package. Its TRD off-road packages are the real deal, not sticker packages inflated by marketing hype. The buying public has responded with fierce loyalty, and this truck has also attracted the attention of the aftermarket, which supports it with many products that enable all sorts of customization. The Tacoma is great for those who want the look and feel of an off-roader even if they'll never get it dirty because it's also an easy-driving and dependable pickup truck.",

    "full_description": "For  the past few years, the Toyota RAV4 has been one of the best-selling vehicles  in the U.S. Here at Edmunds, however, we've been less enthusiastic. While the  RAV4 is undoubtedly practical, it has enough minor drawbacks to make us  recommend some other top small SUVs instead. But things are different with the  2021 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid. \nThe  big difference is that we like the hybrid powertrain more than the regular  RAV4's. Not only is it more powerful, but it also gets you better fuel economy  \u2014 about 40 mpg in combined city/highway driving, according to the  EPA. Toyota does charge a little more for the hybrid compared to the regular  RAV4, but it'll be pretty easy to make up for it in reduced fuel costs. \nThough  small SUVs are quite popular, there are surprisingly few direct competitors.  Only recently have the Ford Escape Hybrid and Honda CR-V Hybrid made their  debuts. These three are pretty evenly matched, so it's worth doing some  comparison shopping. And if you want something even more efficient \u2014 though  more expensive \u2014 check out the Toyota RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid.  We  suggest going with the new XLE Premium trim level. It's less expensive than the XSE (last year's recommendation) and  still packs a good mix of features. You don't get the sporty looks or retuned  suspension, but we think it's worth the trade-offs given the savings. How does the RAV4 Hybrid drive? Surprisingly swift acceleration, aided by the hybrid's electric power unit, makes the RAV4 Hybrid kind of fun to drive. There's always enough power ready for lively slingshots around traffic, and straight-line sprints are equally entertaining. Our test vehicle did 0-60 mph in 7.8 seconds. That's more than a second quicker than the non-hybrid RAV4 and respectably quick for a small SUV.\n\n   Things are less amusing when stopping \u2014 the brakes feel mushy and devoid of much feedback \u2014 and the same can be said of the steering. Still, the XSE's sport-tuned suspension helps the hybrid stay planted and stable around turns. All RAV4 Hybrids have all-wheel drive. It's not meant for off-roading, but it will definitely help provide more traction on snowy and icy roads. How comfortable is the RAV4 Hybrid? The RAV4 Hybrid can cover long and short distances in pleasant comfort. The XSE trim we tested handled rough patches and bumps with ease without feeling overly firm or harsh. As for the front seats, they are nicely sculpted and padded appropriately, but the seat bottoms begin to feel flat on longer drives. The passenger side's lack of adjustment can also make it difficult to find a comfortable position.\n\n   At highway speeds, the RAV4 is generally quiet. The exception is when you hit the gas for a burst of speed, at which point the engine sound gets rather coarse. The climate control system regulates temps quickly and distributes air well throughout the cabin. How\u2019s the interior? It's easy to get in and out of the RAV4 Hybrid's front and back seats, and the roomy cabin gives four adults plenty of space to stretch out. The RAV4 doesn't feel claustrophobic, and there's good visibility in all directions. And while the rear seats are set low, the front seats are oddly high and can't be adjusted down. It can be an issue for taller drivers and front passengers.\n\n   Most controls are logically placed and easy to figure out at a glance. Unfortunately, there's still a long reach to the touchscreen. The tuning knob and buttons on the passenger side of the screen require a reach to use. How\u2019s the tech? Audio and navigation controls are easy to use thanks to a large tablet-style display, but the graphics look pretty dated. The tablet is nothing fancy, but it does the job. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now standard. It's a good thing too since Toyota's native Entune software remains clunky.\n\n   Voice commands can handle basic phone, audio and navigation functions but require deliberate verbal input. It pays to spend time training the system to learn your voice \u2014 or use Siri or Google Voice instead. The inclusion of advanced driver aids as standard equipment is a huge plus. How\u2019s the storage? The RAV4's cargo hold is nearly the largest in its class, hybrid or otherwise, and the load floor is low and makes loading items easy. The battery pack doesn't consume valuable cargo space, and the RAV4 Hybrid offers the same luggage space (37.5 cubic feet) as its gas counterpart. Tie-down hooks and a 12-volt power outlet enhance the hybrid's utility.\n\n   A small center console and a handful of storage nooks offer space for most small items, although a nifty tray lined with rubber grip spanning the length of the dash makes a good spot to park phones and wallets. Parents with young kids will appreciate the RAV4. It's easy to locate and connect safety seats to the lower car seat anchors. Forward-facing seats and boosters fit readily, but installing a rear-facing infant seat on the passenger side will likely require scooting the front seat up. How\u2019s the fuel economy? You'll have a hard time doing better than the RAV4 Hybrid's EPA rating of 40 mpg combined (41 city/38 highway). That's not only impressive in its own right, but it's also a full 10 mpg better than non-hybrid RAV4 models. We averaged 35.2 mpg during our test, and that was when driving with an often heavy foot. Drive a bit more deliberately and 40 mpg is within realistic reach. Is the RAV4 Hybrid a good value? The RAV4 Hybrid looks and feels well built. Nice tactile touches abound, such as rubberized grips on dials and soft landings for elbows. The optional simulated leather upholstery is soft and pliable.\n\n   The hybrid doesn't cost much more than a non-hybrid, and in return you get better power and fuel economy. It'll actually pay for itself in gas savings during your loan or lease. Toyota's traditional warranty coverage is average, but the hybrid components are covered for eight years/100,000 miles. Free scheduled maintenance for two years/25,000 miles is generous. The RAV4's most recent styling change gives it a tougher look, but there's only so much design aggression you can bake into a crossover. Much of the fun of stabbing the hybrid's throttle for a juicy burst of low-end punch is negated by its rubbery steering, numb braking and droning engine under high load. \n\n   Still, its zippy electrically assisted acceleration, taut suspension and modest off-road capability make the RAV4 Hybrid a solid all-around driver. Toyota has mostly succeeded in taking the bland out of the RAV4.",

    "full_description": "The 2010 Toyota Highlander is unchanged other than a new sunroof option on base four-cylinder models and an available rearview camera that's now offered on base V6-powered versions. The 2010 Toyota Highlander's gutsy powertrain, versatile interior and carlike maneuverability make it an ideal choice as a do-all family vehicle. What do you get when you cross a sport-utility vehicle with a sedan? Something that looks an awful lot like the 2010 Toyota Highlander. One of the first of a new breed of crossovers when it debuted almost a decade ago, the midsize Highlander quickly carved out a niche for itself by combining the shape and practicality of a traditional SUV with the more refined ride and handling qualities of a passenger car.Representing the model's second generation, the 2010 Highlander remains a standout in an increasingly crowded segment. One of the Highlander's better attributes is what you'll find under its hood. Though a passable 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine was introduced in the base model last year, it's the 3.5-liter V6 that's the real attraction because of the nice balance it offers between zippy performance and relatively good fuel economy.The conservatively styled Highlander also scores on the inside. There you'll find comfortable seating for up to seven passengers, though accommodations in the standard third row are on the tight side compared to other three-row crossovers. However, the unique 40/20/40-split second-row seat with a center section that can be removed to provide easy walk-through access to the third-row seats is an especially bright idea.While the 2010 Toyota Highlander has a lot to recommend it, it faces some stiff competition. The midsize crossovers from General Motors -- including the Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia -- are appealing alternatives by virtue of their cavernous interiors with seating for up to eight passengers. The capable Ford Flex, the luxurious Hyundai Veracruz and sporty Mazda CX-9 also have their own distinct advantages. That said, we still think the Highlander hits an ideal sweet spot between SUV utility and passenger car comfort. The Toyota Highlander is available with a choice of two engines. Base models can be had with a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine that puts out a respectable 187 horsepower and 186 pound-feet of torque. Power is sent to the front wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy estimates are 20 mpg city/27 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined.By far the more popular (and better) powertrain is the 3.5-liter V6 that's rated at 270 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. A five-speed automatic and front-wheel drive are standard; all-wheel drive is available as an option. This latter combination propelled a Highlander Limited V6 AWD we tested from zero to 60 mph in just 7.8 seconds, a result that makes it one of the quickest crossovers out there. Properly equipped, V6-powered versions can also tow up to 5,000 pounds, another healthy number for this category. With front-wheel drive, the Highlander V6 returns EPA estimates of 18 city/24 highway/20 combined; adding all-wheel drive drops those numbers by 1 mpg. The Highlander comes with a long list of standard safety features including antilock disc brakes, stability control and hill-start assist that helps keep the vehicle from rolling backward when motoring away from a stop on an incline. All-wheel-drive models also come with Downhill Assist, which helps the driver make a slow, controlled descent on steep, slick surfaces like snow-covered driveways.The Highlander's cabin is fitted with a total of seven airbags, including side-impact airbags for front seat passengers, side curtain airbags that cover all three rows of seats and a driver-side knee airbag. Whiplash-reducing active front head restraints are also standard.In government crash tests, the Highlander earned five stars (the highest possible) for the driver and four stars for the front passenger in frontal impacts, and five stars for side impacts. In tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Highlander received \"Good\" ratings in both frontal-offset and side impact tests. If you're used to the lumbering trucklike feel of traditional SUVs, the 2010 Toyota Highlander will feel like a pleasure to drive. The fully independent suspension delivers decent handling, at least by family-hauler standards, and the ride quality is surprisingly smooth even with the slightly firmer suspension on Sport models. The steering feels light enough for easy parking lot maneuverability while retaining enough precision to inspire confidence in everyday driving.The 3.5-liter V6 adds to the appeal by providing strong acceleration that makes this 4,000-pound crossover seem smaller than it is. The fact that this powertrain is also among the most fuel-efficient in the category is an added bonus. The 2010 Toyota Highlander features an attractive cabin, especially on top-of-the-line Limited models. Visibility is excellent and the straightforward layout of gauges and controls makes for refreshingly intuitive operation.Compared to the previous generation, the 2010 Toyota Highlander's passenger compartment offers noticeably better head-, leg- and elbow room. That said, competitors like the Chevrolet Traverse and Ford Flex offer more spacious interiors that may make them a better choice for buyers with large families.Front and second-row seats are plenty comfortable, but the third-row's lack of legroom makes it best suited to pre-teen passengers. The second-row bench slides fore and aft and reclines for greater comfort. This seat's unique 40/20/40-split design, with a removable center section that stows neatly in a special compartment beneath the center console, also makes it easy to access the way-back bench even with a pair of child car seats strapped into the second row.When you've got cargo to haul, the Highlander offers a healthy 95.4 cubic feet of space with the second- and third-row seatbacks folded down. The fact that the third-row seat folds down as a single unit instead of being split 50/50 as in many competitive models is a disadvantage, especially when trying to schlep both passengers and cargo. \nStep up to the Sport model and you get 19-inch alloy wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, automatic headlights, foglights, roof rack side rails and a flip-up rear window in the liftgate. Inside upgrades include a power driver seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and cargo area-mounted releases for folding down the second-row seats, along with a 3.5-inch screen that displays trip computer info and the image from the standard back-up camera.\nThe Highlander SE reverts to 17-inch wheels and the regular suspension but has a standard sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated seats, leather seating and a power passenger seat. The cabin also gets an upgraded driver seat, a power front passenger seat, keyless ignition/entry, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a compass and a satellite-radio-ready audio system with a six-disc CD changer.\nThe Highlander's options list varies by trim level and region, but those available include a sunroof, a power liftgate, heated front seats, automatic rear climate control systems and a towing prep package. Entertainment goodies include a rear DVD entertainment system and a premium nine-speaker JBL sound system that includes Bluetooth cell phone connectivity. A navigation system is also available, but it's only offered on models equipped with the JBL audio system.",

    "full_description": "The 2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid is all-new. The main difference between it and all other Camry models is that it has a gasoline/electric hybrid powertrain that is able to provide exceptional fuel economy. The Camry Hybrid also benefits from the 2007 Camry full redesign, as well. If you want proof that hybrid-powered cars are now officially mainstream, look no further than the 2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid. It delivers the typical Camry traits with the bonus of above-average fuel economy. In our experience, buyers of family sedans are typically looking for cars that provide a roomy and comfortable interior, a refined driving experience and a reputation for reliability. While most modern sedans meet these qualifications, the Toyota Camry, in particular, excels. For 2007, Toyota has fully redesigned this very popular sedan, and we have no doubt it will continue to appeal to a large number of buyers.Of some significance is the all-new 2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid. Like other Camry models, it benefits from the redesign's increase in size, new features and updated interior. The main difference is that under this Camry's hood is a gasoline/electric powertrain. Building off its experience with the Prius and Highlander Hybrid, Toyota has fitted its latest \"Hybrid Synergy Drive\" system into the Camry.The 2.4-liter four-cylinder Atkinson-cycle engine generates 147 horsepower and is coupled to a CVT (continuously variable transmission). The second half of the Hybrid Synergy Drive equation consists of a small, high-torque electric motor that produces 40 horsepower and 199 pound-feet of torque at low rpm. This combination, along with other power-saving features, allows the Camry Hybrid to deliver EPA estimates of 40 mpg city/38 mpg highway.These are the best fuel economy figures of the Camry lineup. But they do not come free; the Camry Hybrid stickers for about $1,500 more than a four-cylinder Camry XLE and thousands more than the more frugal Prius. The associated hybrid hardware also adds some weight and takes up some valuable space inside the trunk.Overall, however, the new Toyota Camry Hybrid is a very impressive and complete sedan. It's transformed the previous image of owning a hybrid vehicle (owner = eccentric granola-fueled beatnik) to one of the acceptable mainstream. Its closest competition comes from, naturally, the Honda Accord Hybrid, though the Accord is considerably more powerful and more expensive. Each has its own particular advantages, but the more fuel-efficient Camry Hybrid is apt to be the better choice for most shoppers. In the Camry Hybrid, the gas-fueled engine is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder modified for greater fuel efficiency, and it's capable of 147 hp and 138 lb-ft of torque. The electric motor adds another 40 hp that provides a cumulative total of 187 hp when driving conditions call for maximum power. The electric motor can also power the Camry Hybrid on its own, but only under light throttle applications at speeds below 30 mph. EPA fuel economy estimates are 40 mpg city, 38 mpg highway. Every Camry comes with seven airbags (dual-stage front airbags, front-seat side, full-length side curtain airbags and a driver knee airbag), a tire-pressure monitor and antilock brakes with brake assist (BA) and EBD (electronic brakeforce distribution. Stability control (which includes traction control) is also standard. Like the Prius, the Toyota Camry Hybrid experience is a bit odd at times due to the CVT transmission and eerily quiet cabin at traffic lights. Not like the Prius, however, is the Camry Hybrid's brisk acceleration. Although not nearly as quick as a V6-powered Camry, the Hybrid is able to hit 60 mph in 8.6 seconds. As for fuel economy, the Camry Hybrid is typical in that driving style has a large impact on the results. Proper technique can keep average fuel economy well above 30 mpg. In addition to more space for passengers, the new Camry Hybrid offers other features that increase cabin comfort. One example is the standard \"Plasmacluster\" air filtration system, which Toyota says ionizes incoming air and neutralizes germs and odors. And like other Camry models, the Hybrid has plenty of cubbies and compartments to hold CDs, cell phones and garage cards. The trunk holds only 10.6 cubic feet of cargo (as compared to a regular Camry's figure of 15 cubic feet) because of the additional space taken up by the battery pack. The 2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid is a midsize sedan. Standard features include 16-inch wheels, keyless entry, power windows and mirrors, Smart Key, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel with audio and cruise controls, a power driver seat, dual-zone automatic climate control with a high-tech air filter, a special multifunction display and a JBL audio system with an in-dash six-CD changer. Popular options include leather seating, a navigation system and a sunroof.",

    "full_description": "For 2016, the Toyota Camry Hybrid is essentially unchanged. With its recently improved cabin quality and handling, the 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid is a compelling and competitive midsize hybrid sedan. Extensively updated last year, the 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid is  a midsize hybrid sedan in midseason form. Good thing, too, because there's more  competition than ever. The Camry Hybrid used to be the obvious choice in this  segment, but these days you've got a number of reasonably priced hybrid sedans  to choose from. Faced with this sudden onslaught, Toyota had no choice but to step up its game.\nThat doesn't mean everyone else is once again playing for  second, but the Camry Hybrid certainly has a lot going for it. The Camry has long  been known for its smooth ride and quiet, roomy interior, but last year's  overhaul added nicer materials and improved controls to the mix. Toyota's  engineers also tightened up the handling as part of the overhaul, making the  sport-tuned SE the most athletic Camry Hybrid yet. As ever, though, fuel  economy is the car's strong point, checking in at an EPA-estimated 40-41 mpg in  mixed driving. Moreover, the Camry Hybrid is actually quicker than the regular  four-cylinder Camry, so when you need a little extra power, you've got it in  reserve.\nThe Camry Hybrid's high fuel economy and invigorated  personality is an appealing combination, but there are multiple rivals that  match or best the Toyota in certain ways. The 2016 Ford Fusion Hybrid gets incrementally better fuel economy and also feels a little more responsive  from behind the wheel, while the Honda Accord Hybrid boasts segment-leading  fuel economy and spirited driving dynamics of its own. Then there's the  reinvented 2016 Hyundai  Sonata Hybrid, which matches the Ford's efficiency and entices with its  sharp styling and modern-looking, high-tech interior. You might also consider  the Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid, a smaller alternative that's nimbler and more  frugal. But the Edmunds \"A\"-rated 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid still has what it takes to lead the charge. The 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid teams a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and a battery pack. Combined output  is a healthy 200 horsepower. A continuously variable transmission (CVT)  delivers that power to the front wheels.\nIn Edmunds testing, a Camry Hybrid SE accelerated from  zero to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds, a quick time for a hybrid midsize sedan.\nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the Camry Hybrid LE is 41 mpg combined (43 city/39 highway). The XLE achieves 40 mpg combined (40 city/38 highway), likely due to the increased rolling resistance of its  larger wheels and tires. The 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid comes with antilock brakes,  stability and traction control, a rearview camera, front and rear side airbags,  front knee airbags and full-length side curtain airbags. On the XLE you can  also get a blind spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert, a lane-departure  warning system and a frontal collision warning system.\nAdditionally, the XLE's optional Safety Connect  telematics system includes an emergency assistance button, stolen-vehicle  notification and automatic collision notification.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, a Camry Hybrid SE stopped from  60 mph in 126 feet, an average showing for a midsize hybrid sedan.\nIn government crash tests, the 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid received  the top five-star  rating overall, with four stars for total frontal impact protection and  five stars for total side impact protection. The Insurance Institute for  Highway Safety gave the standard (non-hybrid) Camry the best possible  rating of \"Good\" in its moderate-overlap and small-overlap frontal-offset  impact tests. The Camry also earned a \"Good\" score in the  side-impact, roof strength and head restraint (whiplash protection) tests. The 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid has a confident driving  character. It holds the road well, especially in sport-tuned SE trim, yet the cabin  remains quiet and mostly undisturbed by bumps and ruts. Most drivers should find  the steering to be reasonably precise. The Hybrid SE isn't the sportiest  entrant in the segment, but Toyota's engineers have done an impressive job of  turning this erstwhile snooze-fest into a rather engaging car.\nIn the engine room, Toyota's hybrid drivetrain is one of the  most sophisticated and refined systems of its kind. The transition from  all-electric mode to the gasoline engine is smooth and unobtrusive. Acceleration  is strong for a midsize hybrid sedan as well, slotting in between the regular  Camry four-cylinder and the Camry V6 in terms of quickness. The Hybrid's CVT  behaves differently than the regular Camry's traditional automatic, of course,  holding revs at a constant high level during full-acceleration bursts, but it's  easy to get used to. The 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid provides one of the most  comfortable and spacious cabins in its class. There's plenty of headroom and  legroom up front and not much less in back, where even taller adults will be  content to ride for extended periods. Moreover, a rear-facing child seat will  fit in back with ease. The fixed rear headrests make it difficult to properly  secure a front-facing child seat, though.\nTrunk space is respectable at 13.1 cubic feet, giving up 2.3  cubes to the non-hybrid Camry. The rear seatback also folds down for added  cargo capacity.\nFrom the driver's vantage point, most of the physical  buttons are large, easy to understand at a glance and glove-friendly. The  sensibly designed climate controls deserve special praise for their simple,  intuitive operation. On the electronics front, the LE and SE get a standard  6.1-inch version of Toyota's Entune touchscreen infotainment system, with an upgraded 7-inch touchscreen standard  on the XLE. The graphics aren't as crisp as the segment's best, but like the  Camry Hybrid's other control interfaces, these screens are relatively  straightforward and easy to use. \nThe LE Hybrid features 16-inch steel wheels, automatic  headlights, heated exterior mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, a rearview  camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, full power accessories, an  eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar), cruise control, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a color driver information display, Bluetooth  phone and audio connectivity, a 6.1-inch touchscreen with Toyota's Entune  technology interface, voice controls, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity,  Siri Eyes Free and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, an auxiliary  audio jack and a USB interface.\nThe SE Hybrid adds 17-inch alloy wheels, sport-themed  styling details, a sport-tuned suspension, a rear spoiler, sport fabric seats  and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\nThe XLE Hybrid includes the LE Hybrid's features along  with its own 17-inch alloy wheels, LED running lights, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a four-way power passenger seat  and Entune Audio Plus, which adds a 7-inch touchscreen, satellite radio and HD  radio.\nEntune Audio Plus is optional on the LE and SE. The SE can  also be had with a sunroof, a Qi wireless  cell phone charger, a navigation system and smartphone app integration.\nThe XLE offers those SE options as well. Also optional on  the XLE is a 10-speaker JBL audio system, a Technology package (automatic high  beam headlights, adaptive cruise control, a forward collision warning system  and lane departure warning), a Safety  Connect package (see Safety, below) and a blind spot monitor with rear  cross-traffic alert.",

    "full_description": "There's  not much else on the road quite like the 2020 Toyota 4Runner. This SUV can seat  seven people and serve as a daily family hauler. Yet it also has strong  off-road capability and a healthy towing capacity. It's not the most refined  SUV around, especially compared to more modern car-based crossovers. But given  the vehicle's popularity with consumers, this doesn't seem to be much of a  drawback. As  a truck-based SUV, the 4Runner is a good option for those who want something  with a little more attitude and presence than the standard crop of car-like  crossovers, including Toyota's own RAV4 and Highlander. Toyota has also made  the 2020 4Runner a little more up-to-date. The big news is that the Toyota  Safety Sense P package, which adds a variety of advanced driver aids, is now  standard on all models. Until this year, it wasn't even available on the  4Runner. There's also a new infotainment system that supports Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto smartphone integration. The  4Runner isn't the most polished SUV around, and its V6 is thirsty compared to  the engines in a lot of similarly priced crossovers. Still, it's hard to find a  vehicle that offers this much capability with this much utility and seating for  up to seven people. The 4Runner isn't the SUV for everyone, but it might be  perfect for some.  While  all variants are relatively capable, we think the TRD Off-Road Premium provides the best combination of performance  and features. It's not as capable as the TRD Pro, but it still includes  features such as a locking rear differential and a specialized suspension to  help you out on the trail. We'd also get the optional Premium package for its  set of features that make it a better vehicle to live with day-to-day. How does the 4Runner drive? The 4Runner's performance is adequate. It's not terribly fast, but the engine and transmission are smooth. It can hold its own in traffic. The brakes are a bit jumpy, and there's some nosedive when you really mash the brake pedal, but you'll get used to it. Around corners, the 4Runner turns in quickly and provides a pleasing amount of stability for a truck-based SUV. Even so, other car-like crossover SUVs are more nimble.    The 4Runner becomes a superstar if you're the sort who would take it off-road for exploring or adventure camping. Its multimode 4WD system, high ground clearance and special TRD features make it capable of taking on rocky trails. If that's important to you, then the 4Runner's otherwise mediocre performance will be more or less insignificant. How comfortable is the 4Runner? You wouldn't be far off the mark if you sized up the 4Runner's comfort potential just by looking at it. You actually can judge this book by its cover. Its truck-based construction results in a somewhat bouncy and stiff ride. It's not terrible, but just about any other crossover SUV rides more smoothly.    The same goes for wind noise as the 4Runner's boxy shape stirs up more than the generally sleeker and more low-slung competition. Interestingly, road noise from the tires is relatively tame because body-on-frame construction provides an extra layer of sound suppression between road and cabin. How\u2019s the interior? Living with a 4Runner is a pretty pleasant experience, but it has one fairly obvious drawback: its tall ride height. That makes getting in and out somewhat difficult, though side steps are available to help out. It's really no worse than any full-size pickup in this regard, but other crossover SUVs are easier to access.    Once you're inside, you'll find easy-to-understand controls and a highly adjustable driving position that affords a commanding view ahead. There's plenty of space in both the front and back rows. Visibility to the sides and back is surprisingly good because of the 4Runner's squared-off shape and windows. How\u2019s the tech? 2020 represents a big change for the 4Runner in this area. Those looking at last year's model should know we didn't like the technology equipment on 2019 and earlier ones nearly as much. The new touchscreen audio system has a larger screen, clearer graphics, and numerous fixed shortcut buttons that make it easier to drill down into the menus without staring at the screen as much. It also now supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity.     Another improvement has to do with active driver safety aids. Previous 4Runners lacked such systems, but this one has a full suite as standard equipment. How\u2019s the storage? The 4Runner's squared-off cargo area is big. Fold the rear seats down and you can even roll out sleeping bags back there. Cargo can be accessed by opening the hatch, of course, or by lowering the 4Runner's power rear window.     The roomy second row can accommodate car seats in any of the three positions, even bulkier rear-facing models. The square door openings make for easy access, but little kids will have a hard time climbing up into the cabin. Towing capacity is 5,000 pounds, a useful figure that covers most boats and many small camping trailers. And the vehicle is prewired for not only four-pin but also seven-pin trailer plugs that come on trailers with electric trailer brakes. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The aging 4.0-liter V6 engine and five-speed automatic make for a rather thirsty pairing that does no better than 17 mpg combined (16 city/19 highway). This is, on average, 4 mpg worse than other rival crossover SUVs with all-wheel drive. Is the 4Runner a good value? The 4Runner costs more than some of the crossovers it competes with, but in return you get more in terms of off-highway and towing performance. It also has an incredibly strong resale value, so much of the extra you'll pay up front will come back when you move on to something else later on.    While you own it, you'll have two years of free scheduled maintenance for things such as oil changes and tire rotations. The warranty, should you ever need it, is fairly standard. The 4Runner's big downside occurs at the pump, which you will be visiting often because its rated fuel economy is in the teens in both the city and on the highway. On the road, it's fine. It gets you there. The fun comes in when you take it off-road. And you can because this is the next best thing to a four-door Jeep Wrangler. As every other SUV has descended into crossover pavement-and-snow mediocrity, the 4Runner still waves the flag for the body-on-frame SUV fans who want real off-road performance. It's more legendary than ever.",

    "full_description": "The 2005 Toyota Tacoma has been completely redesigned. The new 2005 Toyota Tacoma is far and away one of the best compact trucks ever offered to the American public. Having made pickups for the U.S. market since 1964 (remember the Stout, anyone?), Toyota introduced its sixth-generation truck, and the Tacoma nameplate, in 1995. An all-new Tacoma debuts this year with across-the-board improvements. Whether it's engine power, interior room or safety features, the newest Tacoma has more of everything than it had before and even a few things it didn't. Like most trucks in its class, the new truck comes in regular, extended cab (Toyota calls it an Access Cab) and crew cab (or Double Cab) body styles in both two- and four-wheel drive. The Tacoma also continues with the popular PreRunner models that offer the look and suspension of the four-wheel-drive trucks sans the actual four-wheel-drive running gear. New styles for 2005 include a long-bed version of the crew cab and the high-performance access cab X-Runner street truck. All regular and access cab models are available with either four- or six-cylinder engines, while the crew cab models use the V6 exclusively. On the low end, an all-new 2.7-liter, four-cylinder engine replaces both the 2.4-liter and 2.7-liter engines used previously. Producing 164 horsepower and 183 pound-feet of torque, the new 2.7 offers a significant boost in horsepower. All V6 models now use a larger 4.0-liter engine in place of the previous 3.4-liter power plant. With 245 hp and 283 lb-ft of torque, the 2005 Toyota Tacoma measures up to every six-cylinder truck in its class and nearly matches the power of the Dodge Dakota's High-Output 4.7-liter V8. Off-road junkies will also be happy to know that the Tacoma now offers both Hill-start Assist Control (HAC) and Downhill Assist Control (DAC) on all models (X-Runner excepted) equipped with an automatic transmission. The X-Runner essentially picks up where the old S-Runner left off, offering a sport-tuned pickup for those who want some utility without giving up the fun. It comes as a six-speed V6 access cab only with a lowered suspension and additional structural bracing underneath that gives the truck its name. Toyota also upgraded the base Tacoma to give it a better value proposition -- never the strongest aspect of the previous model. The least expensive 4x2 regular cab in now outfitted with the kind of standard features you would expect, such as antilock brakes, a CD stereo and multiple power points. Even more impressive than the newly standard features is the overall design and comfort of the interior. With more room in every direction, the 2005 Toyota Tacoma has lost much of the claustrophobic feeling so typical of most compact trucks. There's also a new composite cargo bed that comes standard on all models and incorporates built-in storage units, adjustable tie-down anchors and even an optional 400-watt electrical outlet. Toyota seems well apprised of the fact that while the compact truck category has seen little movement in the last five to 10 years, 2005 marks a rekindling of interest in this segment, with major redesigns for most of the major players. With Toyota's excellent revamp, the Tacoma is now firmly planted in the upper echelon of its class. All regular and access cab models are available with either four- or six-cylinder engines, while the crew cab models use the V6 exclusively. Standard is a 2.7-liter, four-cylinder engine producing 164 horsepower and 183 pound-feet of torque. The 4.0-liter V6 engine serves up a generous 245 hp and 283 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices include either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic for the four-cylinder, while V6 buyers can choose between a six-speed manual and a five-speed automatic. Equipped with the V6 engine, the Tacoma's maximum tow rating is now 6,500 pounds. Antilock brakes with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution and BrakeAssist are standard on all Tacomas. A stability control system is available on all models, except the X-Runner. Crew cab models also offer optional front-seat side airbags and full-length head curtain airbags. Hill-start Assist Control (HAC) and Downhill Assist Control (DAC) are optional on all models (X-Runner excluded) equipped with an automatic transmission. The 2005 Toyota Tacoma has not yet been crash tested. While the standard four-cylinder is certainly adequate, the 4.0-liter V6 is a terrific all-around performer, with plenty of guts down low and a willingness to spin into the upper rev ranges without getting thrashy. In terms of handling, the feeling behind the wheel is of a truck that is well planted at every corner, predictable when pushed and surprisingly agile considering its size. The design of the dashboard controls and instrument cluster mimics Toyota's 4Runner SUV, which isn't a bad thing. The quality of the materials sets a new standard for the class, and the seats have the kind of firm, supportive bolstering not typically found on trucks of this type. Getting into Access Cabs is easier now, thanks to dual rear doors that open wider than before, while the backseat of the Double Cab is now comfortable for full-size adults. The 2005 Toyota Tacoma comes in three body styles: Regular Cab, Access Cab (extended cab) and Double Cab (crew cab). Each is available with two-wheel or four-wheel drive. Toyota also offers Tacomas with a \"PreRunner\" designation. PreRunners are 2WD trucks that have the looks and heavy-duty suspension of 4WD models. Toyota also offers a special 2WD X-Runner access cab sport truck equipped with the V6, a six-speed manual transmission, a sport-tuned suspension and additional structural bracing underneath that gives the truck its name. Standard features on the regular cab include a CD player, a full-size spare tire and a tachometer. Access Cabs add bucket seats, air conditioning and a pair of rear access doors. On top of that, the Double Cab receives keyless entry and power windows, locks and mirrors. An optional SR5 package features color-keyed and chrome trim, intermittent wipers and upgraded interior trim. A JBL audio system with seven speakers is optional on Double Cabs. An available TRD Sport package includes performance suspension and upgraded tires, and a TRD Off-Road package features meaty white-lettered tires and heavy-duty off-road suspension.",

    "full_description": "For 2013 the Toyota Corolla receives a few minor changes including a revised grille and an upgraded audio system (with a touchscreen display) for the upper trim levels. This year also brings Special Edition versions of the LE and S trims that boast unique color schemes and added luxury features. Among fresher rivals, the 2013 Toyota Corolla is no longer a class leader. Competitors offer advantages in key areas, and we suggest cross-shopping popular alternatives before making your decision. The Toyota Corolla has long been a top choice for those  seeking inexpensive, fuel-efficient and reliable transportation. With more than  33 million sold since the nameplate was introduced 40 years ago, this compact  has earned plenty of adoring fans. That's all dandy, but it doesn't make the  2013 Toyota Corolla an automatic choice for today's buyer.\nThe Corolla's competition is tougher today than it was even just  five years ago. Carmakers including Chevrolet, Ford and Hyundai have  dramatically stepped up their game in that brief span, and the Corolla feels dated  and outclassed compared to the fresher competition. The Corolla's exterior  styling also lacks excitement, while the interior similarly disappoints with drab  design and unimpressive materials. \nThe Corolla has even been surpassed in affordability, fuel  economy and dependability. While many newer rivals boast 40 mpg highway fuel  economy estimates, the Corolla rates 34 mpg. The Toyota's dependability is still rock solid,  but some competitors have improved on that score and offer longer warranties to  reinforce the point.\nA 2013 Toyota Corolla will provide steadfast transportation  and low running costs for years to come. But all things considered, we think there  are better choices including the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford  Focus, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra  and Mazda 3.  All offer some combination of more engaging driving dynamics, better overall  cabin quality and higher fuel economy. Every 2013 Toyota Corolla is powered by a 1.8-liter inline-4  that produces 132 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed manual  transmission is standard and a four-speed automatic is optional.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, an automatic-equipped  Corolla accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 10.1 seconds -- one of the slowest  times in the small car class. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 26 mpg city/34 mpg  highway and 29 mpg combined with the automatic and 27/34/30 with the manual --  respectable numbers, but they pale next to newer competitors that achieve 40  mpg on the highway. Standard safety features include stability and traction  control, antilock brakes (front disc, rear drum), front side airbags and side  curtain airbags. In Edmunds brake testing, the Corolla came to a stop from 60  mph in 127 feet, which is a bit longer than average.\nIn government crash tests, the Corolla received an overall  score of four stars (out of a possible five), with four stars for overall  frontal-impact safety and five stars for overall side-impact safety. In  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash testing, the Corolla earned a top \"Good\"  rating in the frontal-offset, side and roof strength tests. The 2013 Toyota Corolla's softly sprung ride is perfect for  commuting, and wind and road noise are nicely quelled even at highway speeds.  Handling is unimpressive, though. Even if you don't profess to be a driving  enthusiast, a back-to-back drive between a Corolla and its competitors reveals  that the Toyota feels less responsive to driver input and makes you feel less  involved with the driving experience.\nThe Corolla's lone engine choice delivers the sort of languid  acceleration typical of this price point, but Toyota makes a smooth engine, so  at least your ears won't be paying for it. Given that the car's fuel economy  isn't as competitive as it once was, however, you may be less willing to put up  with such lackluster performance. The 2013 Corolla's cabin is a bit dull and the materials quality  is uninspiring at best. By comparison, the cabins of the Ford Focus and Hyundai  Elantra feel as if they belong to a more sophisticated market segment. On the  upside, the Corolla's controls are quite simple to use.\nAs with most Toyotas, the Corolla's seats are soft and  comfy, and will likely bring to mind words like \"plush\" and \"La-Z-Boy.\"  The seats lack support, however, so some may find long-distance comfort  troublesome. The front seats offer decent space even for taller drivers (a  revelation for a small Toyota), while the backseat also boasts decent room and  a cushy bottom.\nWith 12.3 cubic feet of space, trunk space is average, but  the wide opening is particularly useful. \nStandard features on the base L model include 15-inch steel  wheels, full power accessories, keyless entry, air-conditioning, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable driver seat, a  60/40-split-folding rear seat, trip computer and a four-speaker sound system  with a CD player and an auxiliary audio jack.\nThe LE adds 16-inch steel wheels, heated mirrors, variable  intermittent wipers, cruise control, Bluetooth, steering wheel audio controls  and a six-speaker sound system with a 6-inch touchscreen display, an auxiliary  audio jack, iPod/USB connectivity and Bluetooth audio streaming. The S adds  foglights, a sport-look body kit, a rear spoiler, upgraded cloth upholstery and  metallic interior trim.\nOptional on the LE and S is a Premium package that adds a  sunroof and upgraded wheels. The Premium interior package for the Corolla LE  adds automatic headlights, an eight-way power driver seat, automatic climate  control and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Also available is a touchscreen  navigation system with voice control, satellite radio and smartphone app integration  through Toyota's Entune system.\nThe LE Special Edition features a unique exterior paint  color, 16-inch alloy wheels, a navigation system with Entune, a power driver  seat, heated front seats and leather upholstery. The S Special Edition also comes  with a unique exterior paint color, 17-inch alloy wheels and the navigation  system.",

    "full_description": "The base engine is now a 245-hp, 4.0-liter V6 that uses either a six-speed manual or optional five-speed automatic. The optional 4.7-liter V8 now makes 282 hp and is coupled with a standard five-speed automatic transmission. Two-wheel-drive regular cabs are now available with a V8 engine, while four-wheel-drive Access Cabs can no longer be equipped with a V6. Regular cabs equipped with the V8 get a color-keyed grille and chrome front bumper, as well as vinyl flooring and a cloth bench seat. Two new alloy wheel designs are available on Access Cab and Double Cab models, and all Tundras get new headlamps and rear combination lamps. Inside, new gauges and an available navigation system with JBL audio spruce things up a bit. In addition, Double Cabs can now get a 60/40-split bench front seat for true six-passenger seating. Front side-impact airbags and full-length head curtain airbags are now available on Double Cabs.  If you have to drive a truck everyday and heavy-duty towing isn't a concern, the 2005 Toyota Tundra should be in your driveway.  The Tundra, Toyota's full-size truck, has been on sale since 2000. The Tundra competes against the Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra twins, the Dodge Ram, the Ford F-150 and the Nissan Titan. The Tundra has been a successful vehicle for Toyota. But it hasn't always been this way. Toyota's first attempt at a full-size truck -- the T100 -- wasn't well received by the American public when it debuted in 1993. Upon introduction, the T100 was offered only as a regular cab without different bed lengths. It also lacked a V8, a serious shortcoming in the eyes of power-hungry, load-towing truck buyers. While the T100 continued to tank, Toyota engineers and designers began working on a better, more powerful truck that they thought would be more appealing to U.S. buyers. Early on, Toyota figured out that a V8 engine was vital to any full-size truck's sales success in this country. They also discovered that many pickup trucks are actually used for serious work and play, meaning that payload and towing capacities had to be increased. Lastly, Toyota realized that consumers expect certain things when they buy a Toyota: excellent build quality, class-leading reliability and well-designed interiors. The 2005 Toyota Tundra meets those requirements, especially with last year's introduction of a roomy Double Cab version. Larger dimensions all around allow this four-door Tundra to compete favorably with the domestic competition. Its length of over 230 inches makes it six inches longer than Ford's SuperCrew. The Double Cab is also three inches wider and three inches taller than its regular cab and extended cab stablemates. The cargo bed remains the same size in length and width but Toyota made it 3.5 inches deeper for added capacity. Inside, the rear bench is split 60/40 and there's 24 degrees of seat back angle for a more carlike feel. A unique feature on the Double Cab is a roll-down rear window at the back of the cab that further enhances the truck's spacious feel. At the end of the day, the 2005 Toyota Tundra still isn't as big as the domestic trucks or the Titan, nor does it have the usual mind-numbing array of features and options. But for many people, those extras could be superfluous. Toyota's first full-size truck is a very good one, especially for the general consumer rather than the contractor or construction worker. Two dual-overhead-cam engines are available: a 4.0-liter V6 and a 4.7-liter V8. The V6 makes 245 horsepower and 282 pound-feet of torque, while the V8 musters 282 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. The V6 comes with either a six-speed manual or an optional five-speed automatic. The V8 is offered with the five-speed automatic only. Either engine can be had with four-wheel drive. Maximum towing capacity is 7,100 pounds. The brakes -- discs up front and drums in the rear -- are equipped with standard ABS. Side-impact airbags for front occupants and full-length side curtain airbags with a rollover sensor are optional on Double Cabs. In government crash tests, the 2005 Toyota Tundra received a four-star rating (out of five) for driver and front-passenger protection in frontal impacts. The Toyota earned a perfect five stars for front-occupant protection in side impacts. The IIHS gave the truck a \"Good\" rating (its best) for frontal offset crashes. The V6 is powerful enough for light-duty use, and the V8 certainly has enough oats for everyday driving and typical towing and hauling. Slightly smaller than other full-size trucks, the Tundra is more maneuverable in crowded areas. The standard suspension is softly tuned -- it's comfortable for commuting, but less suitable for hauling heavy loads. The Access Cab's rear-seat area is useful, but it's smaller than the quarters in other full-size extended cabs. The Double Cab's 60/40-split rear seat boasts legroom on par with its domestic competitors and a reclined seat back for better comfort. Up front, the Tundra offers a typical blend of solid-feeling switchgear, though the materials used are often of mediocre quality, and overall style is bland. The 2005 Toyota Tundra is available in regular, extended (Access Cab) and crew cab (Double Cab) versions. Regular cabs come only in long bed form, while Access and Double Cabs come only as short beds. Access Cabs have two \"suicide\" rear doors for easier rear-seat access, while Double Cabs feature four full-size doors and, thanks to their longer wheelbase, equal bed length. There are also three trim levels: base, SR5 and Limited. Available only on regular cabs, the base trim's amenities are limited to antilock brakes, 16-inch steel wheels, a cloth bench seat and a CD player. The SR5 adds body-color bumpers, a chrome grille and air conditioning; V8-equipped models also get cruise control. Available with a V8 only, the Limited offers alloy wheels, an in-dash CD changer and power windows, mirrors and locks. Compared to domestic full-size trucks, the Tundra's options list is short. The convenience package for SR5 models includes full power accessories, cruise, a sliding rear window and keyless entry. You can also get a towing package, a cold-weather package, an off-road package and a sport suspension package. On Limited trucks, there are optional leather-upholstered captain's chairs with a power driver seat. A DVD entertainment system is available for Double Cab models. For added style, Toyota also offers a stepside bed on V8-powered Access Cabs.",

    "full_description": "Twenty-one years after the last Supra  vacated American dealerships, Toyota has unveiled an all-new model. The 2020  Toyota GR Supra is a two-seater sports car designed to take on such luminaries  as the Audi TT and Porsche Cayman, and it's engineered with more than a little  help from BMW. Peel back the bespoke bodywork, and you'll discover the guts of  the new 2019 BMW Z4, including its engine and gearbox. The new Supra is thus a  curious mix of German and Japanese parentage.  The GR stands for Gazoo Racing, a  motorsports-influenced signature for specialty vehicles that Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda  has had personal involvement in developing. Its addition to the Supra moniker  means this car is important not just to fans but to the company as well.Get out on a racetrack or a deserted road  and you'll find the Supra is a riot to drive. It is deftly balanced and easily  controllable, and its lively yet forgiving demeanor welcomes various driving  styles and skills. On paper, the Supra's 335 horsepower seems low when compared  against a V8-powered Chevrolet Camaro (455 hp) or a Ford Mustang (460 hp). Yet  the turbocharged engine is surprisingly muscular and provides similar  acceleration as those muscle cars. The view from the driver's seat serves as  a reminder that the Supra shares the majority of its underpinnings with the BMW  Z4 convertible. The parts and layout aren't identical, but you'll recognize the  shifter, climate controls, infotainment screen and ignition chime. The Supra's  interior even smells like a new BMW. The only obvious Toyota bits include the  digital gauge cluster and the large steering wheel badge. Toyota might have taken an unconventional  route to revive its iconic sports car, but the result is nonetheless  impressive. Offering an invigorating mix of performance, style and fun, the  2020 GR Supra brings just the right amount of heritage and 21st-century  technology.  The  midrange 3.0 Premium trim gets our  recommendation. The upgraded rear brakes along with additional tech and  convenience items easily justify the cost increase over the base model. How does the GR Supra drive? The Supras of the past were more about straight-line speed than nimble handling, but this latest incarnation succeeds at both. In Edmunds testing, our Supra Launch Edition rocketed to 60 mph in a quick 4.2 seconds. Around turns, the steering wheel communicates a fair amount of information from the front tires to your hands. It's also quick and responsive and a good match for the lively suspension. If you don't know what oversteer is, you'll soon be acquainted with it after driving this car.    The powerful brakes and sticky tires can haul the Supra to a stop from 60 mph in just 105 feet. Yet the Supra isn't strictly a weekend car. Rather, it's something you could drive with little effort every day. How comfortable is the GR Supra? The seats provide excellent support, but you might find them a bit confining around your shoulders. It's not too noticeable when driving at speed, but it's apparent when cruising around. The leather upholstery isn't perforated, so its breathability isn't great. The ride quality is firm but not harsh. Because you sit so close to the rear axle, big vertical movements feel more pronounced.    We wouldn't call this a quiet cabin since there's a fair amount of road and wind noise, but it's not unpleasantly loud either. It lets in the right amount of induction noise and exhaust burbles when driving in Sport mode. As for the climate control system, there's no obvious way to sync its two zones, which is odd. It could stand to be a tick stronger at max fan speed too. How\u2019s the interior? Those familiar with BMW's older iDrive system will feel right at home with the Supra infotainment. But if you're a first-time user, you'll need to get acquainted with the system's menu layout. All other controls are pretty straightforward.     The Supra's doors are a little shorter than average and fairly light. If you're taller, you may need to watch your head, but at least the seat bolsters don't impede access. In general, spaciousness is not this car's greatest strength. The Porsche Cayman and BMW M2 do a better job of making a cockpit feel roomy, for instance. How\u2019s the tech? The navigation system is pretty good at understanding natural language commands, and it locates specific points of interest without an address. It's easy to use the voice commands to set up your route. Our test Supra had the 12-speaker premium audio system. The audio quality is fine, but it lacks the fullness we'd expect for an upgrade system. As for integration, there's one USB port, an optional wireless charger and wireless Apple CarPlay (without the BMW subscription cost). Android Auto isn't offered.    The Supra's adaptive cruise control is optional, and it works effectively. It's more aggressive than most and can keep a small gap between you and the car ahead if you want it to. It also works all the way down to a stop. Lane keeping assist isn't quite as effective. It'll mitigate lane crossing but doesn't really keep you centered. How\u2019s the storage? Sports cars are usually compromised when it comes to cargo space, and the Supra is no exception. The Supra has less trunk space (10.2 cubic feet) than the Porsche Cayman and the BMW M2. There is a cargo pass-through to the cabin that you can use when hauling longer items. But you'll have to rest those items on the rear-suspension tower brace.    The small-item storage space is even more deficient in the cabin. The cupholders are located where an armrest bin would typically be. And if you store drinks in them, they will interfere with operating the infotainment system controls. A wireless device charging pad is optional, but plus-size phones won't really fit in it. The door pockets and glovebox are also small. How\u2019s the fuel economy? Fuel efficiency is not an area we expected the Supra to shine in, but shine it does. It returns an EPA-estimated 26 mpg combined (24 city/31 highway). In our testing, we observed an impressive 29 mpg on our 115-mile evaluation loop. This result trounces the BMW M2 Competition (20 mpg combined) and even outperforms the base-model Porsche Cayman (24 mpg combined). Is the GR Supra a good value? The Supra's cabin looks more BMW than Toyota, but it's still a pleasant space that delivers a luxury-level look and feel. The Launch Edition's carbon-fiber trim is a nice touch and helps make the Supra seem a bit more special than your average coupe. Even if you buy the base-level Supra, you're getting a heck of a bargain.    Toyota's warranty coverage is a trade-off compared to competitors. There's less bumper-to-bumper coverage but better powertrain coverage. Two years of scheduled maintenance is also included. The new Supra mostly delivers on its promises. Sure, there is a lot of obvious BMW DNA here, but that doesn't make it any less of a car if what you value are performance and swoopy styling. The Supra's appeal is undeniable for the price. It's properly quick and lively, yet it's also comfortable enough to be your daily driver so long as you don't need to take much with you.",

    "full_description": "For 2017, the Toyota Camry Hybrid adds Entune Audio Plus entertainment system and wireless smartphone charging as standard features on some trim levels. Automatic emergency braking is now also available. Shopping for a midsize hybrid sedan once meant deciding  between the Honda Accord or the Toyota Camry. Strong alternatives from Ford and  Hyundai have made this segment more competitive than ever, but the 2017 Toyota  Camry has kept pace with the competition.  \nToyota gave the Camry a thorough update two years ago, and  the 2017 model carries over those new features and adds a few extras. Top-trim  level XLE models now come standard with a wireless smartphone charging pad;  it's also available as an option on SE trims. XLE models also now come standard  with a premium JBL audio system and a navigation app that operates through your  smartphone rather than as a system integrated into the infotainment system. (A  factory navigation system remains an option, however.) \nThe Camry has long been known for its smooth ride and quiet,  roomy interior, but the earlier overhaul added nicer materials and improved  controls to the mix. Toyota's engineers also tightened up the handling, making  the sport-tuned SE the most athletic Camry Hybrid yet. Fuel economy remains the  car's strong point, checking in at an EPA-estimated 40 mpg in mixed driving.  Moreover, the Camry Hybrid is actually quicker than the regular four-cylinder  Camry, so when you need a little extra power, you've got it in reserve.\nThe Camry Hybrid's high fuel economy and comfortable cabin  make an appealing combination, but there are multiple rivals that match or  better the Toyota in certain ways. The 2017 Ford Fusion Hybrid gets incrementally  better fuel economy and also feels a little more responsive from behind the  wheel, while the Honda Accord Hybrid boasts segment-leading fuel economy and  spirited driving dynamics of its own. Then there's the reinvented 2017 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, which matches the  Ford's efficiency and entices with its sharp styling and modern-looking,  high-tech interior. The 2017 Toyota Camry Hybrid comes with antilock brakes,  stability and traction control, a rearview camera, front and rear side airbags,  front knee airbags and full-length side curtain airbags. On the XLE you can  also get a blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert, a lane  departure warning system and a frontal collision warning system. \nAdditionally, the XLE's optional Safety Connect telematics  system includes an emergency assistance button, stolen vehicle notification and  automatic collision notification. \nIn Edmunds brake testing, a Camry Hybrid SE stopped from 60  mph in 126 feet, an average showing for a midsize hybrid sedan. \nIn government crash tests, the Camry Hybrid earned the top five-star rating overall, with four stars for  total frontal impact-protection and five stars for total side-impact  protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the standard  (non-hybrid) Camry the best possible rating of \"Good\" in  its moderate-overlap and small-overlap frontal-offset impact tests. The Camry  also earned a \"Good\" score in the side-impact, roof strength and head  restraint (whiplash protection) tests. With a roomy interior, loads of tech features, and more performance than the regular four-cylinder model, the 2017 Toyota Camry Hybrid is one of the best midsize hybrid sedans you can buy. The 2017 Toyota Camry Hybrid has a confident driving  character. It holds the road well, especially in sport-tuned SE trim, yet the  cabin remains quiet and mostly undisturbed by bumps and ruts. The Hybrid SE  isn't the sportiest hybrid out there, but Toyota's engineers have done an  impressive job of turning this Camry into a rather engaging car to drive. \nToyota's hybrid drivetrain is one of the most sophisticated  and refined systems of its kind. The transition from all-electric mode to the  gasoline power is smooth and unobtrusive. Acceleration is strong for a midsize  hybrid sedan as well, slotting in between the regular Camry four-cylinder and  the Camry V6 in terms of quickness. The Hybrid's CVT behaves differently than  the regular Camry's traditional automatic, of course, holding revs at a  constant high level during full-acceleration bursts, but it's easy to get used  to. The 2017 Toyota Camry Hybrid offers one of the most  comfortable and roomy cabins in its class. There's plenty of headroom and  legroom up front and nearly as much in back. A rear-facing child seat will fit  in back with ease, but fixed rear headrests make it difficult to properly  secure a front-facing child seat. \nTrunk space is respectable at 13.1 cubic feet, although  that's 2.3 fewer cubic feet than the non-hybrid Camry. The rear seatback folds  down for added cargo capacity. \nFrom the driver's vantage point, most of the physical  buttons are large, easy to understand at a glance, and glove-friendly in cold  weather. The sensibly designed climate controls deserve special praise for  simple, intuitive operation. On the electronics front, the LE and SE get a  standard 6.1-inch version of Toyota's  Entune touchscreen infotainment system, with an upgraded 7-inch  touchscreen standard on the XLE. The graphics aren't as crisp as the segment's  best, but like the Camry Hybrid's other control interfaces, these screens are  straightforward and easy to use. \nThe LE Hybrid features 16-inch steel wheels, automatic  headlights, heated exterior mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, a rearview  camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, full power accessories, an  eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar), cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, a color driver information display, and Toyota's Entune Audio  interface. The latter includes a 6.1-inch touchscreen display, voice controls,  Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, Siri Eyes Free, and a six-speaker sound  system with a CD player, an auxiliary audio jack and a USB interface.\nThe SE Hybrid adds 17-inch alloy wheels, sport-themed  styling details, a sport-tuned suspension, a rear spoiler, sport fabric seats  and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\nThe XLE Hybrid includes the LE Hybrid's features along with  its own 17-inch alloy wheels, LED running lights, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a four-way power passenger  seat, wireless smartphone charging, and Entune Audio Plus, which adds a 7-inch  touchscreen, a smartphone-based navigation app, and a 10-speaker JBL audio  system with satellite radio and HD radio.\nEntune Audio Plus is optional on the LE and SE. The SE can  also be had with a sunroof, wireless smartphone charging, a navigation system  and smartphone app integration. The XLE offers those SE options as well, plus  an integrated navigation system, a Technology package (automatic high-beam  headlights, adaptive cruise control, a forward collision warning system and  lane departure warning), a Safety  Connect package (see Safety, below) and a blind-spot monitor with  rear cross-traffic alert. The 2017 Toyota Camry Hybrid teams a 2.5-liter four-cylinder  engine with an electric motor that together deliver up to 200 horsepower. A  continuously variable transmission (CVT) delivers that power to the front  wheels. \nIn Edmunds testing, a Camry Hybrid SE accelerated from zero  to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds, a quick time for a hybrid midsize sedan. \nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the Camry Hybrid LE is40  mpg combined (42 city/38 highway). The XLE is rated at 38 mpg combined (40  city/37 highway), likely due to the increased rolling resistance of its larger  wheels and tires. \nDrivers can select an available Eco mode that optimizes  accelerator response and air-conditioning to improve fuel economy, as well as  an EV mode, which enables the Camry to travel up to 1.6 miles (below 25 mph) on  the electric motor alone.

    "full_description": "For 2013, the Toyota Camry receives rear cross-traffic alert functionality as part of the optional blind spot monitoring system. Inside, all Camry models have the 6-inch central display screen as standard and slightly upgraded door panel trim. With its well-rounded nature and long-standing history of dependability, the 2013 Camry stands as one of the top choices in the highly competitive midsize sedan segment. After saddling the last generation of its best-selling sedan  with a disappointing interior and dull personality, Toyota  got with it and redesigned the Camry  last year. The newest Camry continues the model's long-standing record of  reliability and low running costs and adds an improved interior, more  expressive styling and, especially in SE trim, livelier driving. The 2013  Toyota Camry gets further polish with a few more standard features and upgraded  interior materials.\nAs before, the Camry powertrain lineup deserves kudos for its  combination of peppy performance and admirable fuel economy. Even the four-cylinder  engine provides pleasing acceleration, while the potent V6 manages an  impressive 25 mpg in combined driving. Those seeking a fuel sipper can choose the  Camry Hybrid, covered in a separate review. Although the Camry offers  respectable handling and a comfortable ride, the driving experience still feels  rather disconnected and numb. The SE trim provides sharper, more involved handling  that doesn't exactly transform the Camry into a sport sedan, but offers more  appeal to those who enjoy driving. \nNaturally, there are other appealing midsize sedans out this  year. The 2013 Honda Accord and 2013 Nissan Altima  continue to offer slightly sportier personalities to enhance their practicality.  The 2013 Hyundai Sonata offers comparable refinement and stellar value. The new Ford Fusion is another  favorite of ours thanks to well-rounded performance and sharp styling. We think  most people will be very pleased with a 2013 Toyota Camry purchase, but with so  many great choices, we suggest planning a weekend's worth of test-drives. Every 2013 Toyota Camry features front-wheel drive, a  six-speed automatic transmission and two engine choices.\nBase Camrys are powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that  produces 178 horsepower and 170 pound-feet of torque. In Edmunds performance  testing, a Camry LE with this engine accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 8.4  seconds, about average for a four-cylinder midsize sedan. With EPA-estimated  fuel economy of 25 mpg city/35 highway and 28 combined, the four-cylinder Camry  is among the class leaders.\nOptional is a 3.5-liter V6 that generates 268 hp and 248  lb-ft of torque, which helps the Camry V6 reach 60 mph in 6.6 seconds, average  for upgrade engines in this class. Fuel economy is an impressive 21/31/25. The 2013 Toyota Camry comes with a battery of standard safety  features, including antilock brakes, stability control, front- and rear-seat  side airbags, side curtain airbags and knee airbags for both driver and  passenger. A blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert is also  available.\nIn Edmunds braking tests, a Camry LE stopped from 60 mph in  129 feet, a bit longer than average for the segment. An SE V6, with stickier  tires, performed the same test in 119 feet, which is better than average. \nIn government crash testing, the Camry received a top  five-star score for overall crash protection, with four stars for overall  frontal protection and five stars for overall side protection. The Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety gave the Camry the best possible rating of \"Good\"  in the frontal-offset, side and roof strength tests. It scored a \"Poor\"  (the worst rating) in that agency's new, \"small overlap\" frontal  impact crash test, but only a handful of cars have been subjected to it, and  most have earned a similar score. Both four-cylinder and V6 engines generate ample power for  their sizes, and that power is delivered in a smooth, quiet fashion. Gearchanges  are likewise unobtrusive, and for a car that earns such high fuel economy  numbers, the transmission surprises with quick downshifts when additional power  is needed. On the highway, the 2013 Toyota Camry is comfortable and an  excellent long-distance companion.\nThe electric-assisted steering feels pretty good in the V6  and SE versions. But non-SE four-cylinder versions are vague and somewhat  lifeless in comparison. Most drivers will probably be fine with the way the  Camry drives, but we still recommend the SE. It's not exactly sporty, but does  feel more in line with the handling and responsiveness of its best rivals. The interior of the 2013 Camry feels roomy and its thin front  pillars provide good outward visibility. What the cabin design lacks in cohesiveness,  it makes up for with generally good materials quality, especially the handsome  stitching on the dash and door panels of upper trims. The spacious rear seat is  complemented by a nicely reclined seatback angle that helps the Camry match the  Honda Accord for the most comfortable backseat in the class.\nThe Camry's upgraded audio system also includes Entune, a  suite of smartphone-connected services that includes features like the Bing  search engine, Pandora streaming radio, real-time traffic, sports and stock  information, and the ability to reserve movie tickets or a table at a  restaurant on the go. The touchscreen interface and accompanying steering wheel  controls are usually pretty easy to use, but sometimes the virtual buttons'  unwillingness to respond is frustrating.\nAt 15.4 cubic feet, the Camry's trunk capacity is about  average, although the 60/40-split rear seat folds down to yield more cargo space  when necessary. \nThe Camry LE adds automatic headlamps, power door locks with  remote keyless entry, audio controls on the steering wheel and an outside  temperature display.\nThe SE includes a sport-tuned suspension, 17-inch alloy  wheels, foglamps, heated exterior mirrors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, sport  seats and unique interior and exterior styling treatments. SE V6 models get  18-inch wheels, keyless ignition/entry, a navigation system, voice recognition  and the Entune smartphone and Web integration system.\nThe luxurious XLE reverts to the LE's softer suspension  settings and adds heated exterior mirrors, foglamps, a sunroof, dual-zone  automatic climate control, an eight-way power driver seat and the Entune system.  XLE V6 models add a rearview camera, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather  upholstery, a power front passenger seat and heated front seats.\nSome of the extra features found on the higher trims can be  added as options to the lower trim levels, though availability can vary  depending on which region of the country you live in. A premium 10-speaker JBL  audio system is optional for the SE and XLE. On the XLE V6, Toyota also offers  a hard-drive-based navigation system with a larger central display.",

    "full_description": "A new Technology package for the Limited model bundles last year's blind-spot monitoring system with a lane departure warning system and automatic high-beam control. Otherwise, the 2014 Toyota RAV4 is unchanged. Although the 2014 Toyota RAV4 isn't a standout in any one area, its combination of features, passenger space and everyday utility warrant a closer look if you're shopping for a small crossover.  Small crossover SUVs like the 2014 Toyota RAV4 have become popular with a broad population of shoppers. And it's little wonder: In spite of their relatively compact dimensions, these vehicles provide useful space for small families and singles alike. They're easy to drive in crowded cities, and they typically return at least respectable fuel economy (and oftentimes better). In short, small crossovers are very nearly the perfect vehicle for modern Americans on the go. Although the Toyota RAV4 isn't a hands-down favorite in this class, you'll probably find that it checks off most of the boxes on your list.\nSpace is the five-passenger RAV4's biggest asset. Driver and passenger room are excellent up front, and a pair of adults will be content in the backseat on short trips. Further, buyers traveling with dogs or bulky gear will appreciate the Toyota's large cargo bay, low load floor and, on the Limited model, power liftgate (still a relatively rare convenience on SUVs in this class). With the rear seats folded down, the RAV4 has one of the largest cargo capacities in its class with 73.3 cubic feet.\nOn the move, the Toyota RAV4 is easy to see out of, and it feels steady around turns and comfortable cruising the highway. Its acceleration is merely average for a compact crossover SUV, though, and unlike with many competitors, there's no optional engine upgrade if you want more oomph than the standard 2.5-liter four-cylinder has to offer. Likewise, the RAV4's fuel economy ratings are good, but not class-leading.\nGiven the quality of the competition in the small crossover class, it's worthwhile to check out a few alternatives. When it comes to all-around versatility, the 2014 Honda CR-V dominates the class. There's nothing truly remarkable about driving this Honda, but it's comfortable, quiet and fuel-efficient, and its roomy cabin is loaded with clever storage areas and handy conveniences. If you really enjoy driving, the 2014 Mazda CX-5 is one of the more entertaining compact crossovers, though its interior, while spacious, isn't quite as functional.\nAnother very good option is the 2014 Ford Escape, which gives you a choice of three engines and has a higher-end interior than you usually see in this class. Finally, if you have any desire to drive off-road and have at least a fair amount of capability to back it up, the new Jeep Cherokee can accommodate, and it's also one of the few models available with a V6 engine.\nAlthough the 2014 Toyota RAV4 doesn't have significant advantages over its rivals, it's a capable small crossover SUV that will meet the needs of most shoppers.  The 2014 Toyota RAV4 is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 176 horsepower and 172 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard, and the RAV4 is available with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.\nIn Edmunds testing, an all-wheel-drive Toyota RAV4 needed 9.2 seconds to hit 60 mph, an average time for a small crossover with a base four-cylinder engine.\nThe front-drive RAV4 is EPA-rated at 26 mpg combined (24 mpg city/31 mpg highway), which are good, but not class-leading numbers for a small crossover. The AWD model is rated at 25 mpg combined (22 mpg city/29 mpg highway). Standard safety equipment on every 2014 Toyota RAV4 includes antilock disc brakes, a rearview camera, stability control, traction control, whiplash-reducing front head restraints, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags. A driver knee airbag is also standard. A rearview camera is standard across the board, while the optional Technology package on the Limited provides blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alerts and lane departure warnings.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the RAV4 stopped from 60 mph in 128 feet, which is longer than average.\nIn government crash tests, the Toyota RAV4 received a rating of four stars out of five for overall protection, with four stars awarded for frontal protection and five stars for side-impact protection. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the new RAV4 earned a top score of \"Good\" for its protection of occupants in moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and roof strength tests. Its seat/head restraint was also rated Good for whiplash protection in rear impacts. However, the RAV earned a Poor rating (the lowest) in the Institute's small-overlap frontal-offset crash test.  Most small crossover shoppers will find the 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine adequately powered for most tasks and sufficiently fuel-efficient.  The six-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly, but if you tend to drive  assertively, you'll find it slow to downshift in passing situations.  Additionally, when climbing steady mountain grades, we've observed that the  transmission has a tendency to hunt between gears (rather than picking one gear  and sticking with it). Both of these issues are a consequence of Toyota's  efforts to tune the drivetrain for maximum gas mileage.\nThe 2014 Toyota RAV4 handles well and feels refined and  comfortable when cruising down the highway. A potential exception is the  Limited model, which can get a little jittery on rough or broken pavement due  to its big 18-inch wheels. In spite of that, the cabin remains very quiet,  making Toyota's crossover a good option for families with young children who  sleep in the car.\nOverall, the RAV4 is similar in personality to Honda's CR-V,  and more demanding drivers might find it less enjoyable to drive than sportier  crossovers like the Escape and CX-5, which have more responsive steering. If  comfort is your overriding priority, though, the Toyota should do right by you.  Additionally, if you need to venture off the beaten path, the RAV4's available  AWD system quickly applies power where it's needed for optimum traction and actually  gives it a decent amount of off-road ability. The 2014 Toyota RAV4 features an interior design that shares motifs with the current Camry and Avalon. Pronounced angles and lines form a streamlined and modern-looking dash. Overall, though, the RAV's design and materials are average for the compact crossover class, and a few of the audio and climate controls feel slightly flimsy. The cupholder count is adequate in the Toyota RAV4, but there aren't as many useful storage slots as in the CR-V.\nAlthough all of the RAV4's audio systems have Toyota's Entune branding this year, only XLE and Limited models with the navigation system include the Entune suite of smartphone-connected services, among these the Bing search engine, Pandora streaming radio and traffic, sports and stock information. There's quite a bit of functionality here, but getting started with Entune can be a hassle: You have to install an app on your phone and register for an account, plus you always need an active data connection to use its features. The touchscreen interface has straightforward menus, but it's sometimes unresponsive to user touch (curiously, we've found the more basic touchscreen in the LE better in this regard). On the upside, all the conventional controls in the 2014 RAV4 are easy to use.\nRear-seat passenger comfort is hampered slightly by a low-mounted backseat, but space is nevertheless abundant enough even for taller adults. We also like how the seat reclines to an impressive degree.\nThe cargo bay measures 38.4 cubic feet and opens up to a generous 73.3 cubes when the second row is folded: one of the largest capacities in the class. There's also a payoff for that low-mounted rear seat: a very flat floor and low load-in height, both of which help minimize the strain of loading large items or even a couple of large dogs. The Limited model is especially convenient, as its liftgate is power-operated and height-adjustable. \nThe XLE adds 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, heated side mirrors with integrated turn signals, roof rails, a sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, sportier front seats, a cargo cover and extendable sun visors. The audio system is upgraded on the XLE to include satellite radio, HD radio, traffic and weather. An option package allows you to add a navigation system and Toyota's Entune smartphone app integration to the XLE.\nThe top-level Limited comes with all of the above plus 18-inch alloy wheels, a height-adjustable power liftgate, keyless entry and ignition, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, an eight-way power-adjustable driver seat with memory settings, heated front seats and premium synthetic leather upholstery. Options on the Limited include a navigation system bundled with a premium 11-speaker JBL audio system. The Technology package adds a blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alerts, a lane-departure warning system and automatic high-beam control for the headlights.",

    "full_description": "The 2018 Prius Prime is unchanged from the previous model year. The  2018 Toyota Prius Prime is a plug-in hybrid version of the regular Prius. It  has a bigger battery that you can recharge with an external power source. Doing  so gives you the ability to drive about 25 miles on all-electric power before  the car switches over to regular hybrid operation. After that, the Prime  returns an impressive 54 mpg in combined city/highway driving.  Like  a standard Prius, the Prius Prime can operate without ever being plugged in.  Simply refuel as you go and enjoy the long legs of your journey between  fill-ups. Or, if you're able to recharge frequently, you can use the Prius  Prime much as you would an all-electric vehicle.The  Prime's styling is a bit different from the regular Prius' (we'd argue it's  less goofy-looking, actually), and the seating capacity is down from five  passengers in the standard Prius to four. But the driving experience is  similar. Still, the bigger battery adds  weight, and that has a detrimental effect on handling and acceleration. The  battery also reduces maximum cargo capacity compared to the regular Prius.You'll  want to look at a couple of rivals if you're shopping for a plug-in hybrid. The  Chevrolet Volt is sportier to drive and has a longer electric range than the  Prime, but overall fuel economy with the Volt is lower and the price is higher.  Honda's new Clarity Plug-In Hybrid is another top contender. Overall, the 2018  Toyota Prius Prime is a solid pick if you're shopping for an efficient and  affordable plug-in hybrid. The 2018 Toyota Prius Prime is a plug-in hybrid with high efficiency and an attainable price. But there are some drawbacks. Passenger and cargo space are limited, and it's not enjoyable to drive. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2017 Toyota Prius Prime (1.8L inline-4  hybrid | CVT automatic | FWD). The electric powertrain has sufficient punch for city driving, but don't think you can rely on it with confidence when merging onto the freeway or pulling out to pass. You'll be using a lot of the engine's power for any real acceleration. Our 0-60 mph test run took 10 seconds, which is pretty slow. There's a decent amount of braking power for routine use. But stops can be hard to judge because there's not much feel and the brakes can get grabby, especially in harder applications. Our emergency-panic stop from 60 mph used up 119 feet, and the car tended to wiggle a bit as it came to a halt. While the vehicle goes where you point it, the steering feels light and numb when cruising straight on the highway, and effort doesn't change much as you round corners. It improves somewhat if you decide to push it on a winding road, but in routine use the Prime doesn't feel all that connected. A Prime's enlarged plug-in battery represents extra weight that sits somewhat high behind the rear wheels, which throws off the balance markedly compared to a regular Prius. It feels heavy, and the soft springs and sluggish damping feel inadequate, most notably when corners come one after another. The theme is efficiency, so unless you're using big gas pedal inputs, the Prime responds sluggishly. Driving up big hills highlights the lack of power and the vocal gas engine, but downhills are an opportunity to recharge the battery. The Prime loves the city, and it responds well to stop-and-go. The seats are ergonomically well-designed. They're not couch-soft but have that initial give that lets them conform to your body. The seat bottom is short, but we had no issues on a long drive. The rear seats are similar to the fronts, but with broader seatbacks. They're also properly comfortable. The Prime's ride is generally flat, and it does not float or wallow. Its suspension handles small, rolling-type bumps quite well, but the suspension and tires tend to transmit harsh square-edge bumps directly into the cabin, especially if they come one after another. Obviously, it's very quiet in EV mode. But the gas engine is annoyingly noisy when you've got the pedal pinned. There's some wind and road noise, both of which become noticeable mainly when the engine is off at near-highway speeds in EV mode. The Prius has an effective automatic climate control system, but on the Premium and Advanced only the temperature and defroster have physical buttons. Everything else is on the touchscreen. The Plus uses an easier system. The unique Eco mode has the ability to focus cooling solely on the driver. We've never liked the Prius' central dash, and the Prime Advanced (and Premium) also has a huge touchscreen with layered menus for many functions. Volume is on the passenger side, and a passenger must reach to the driver's side to adjust temperature. All of this is far easier on the base Plus model. Easy for people to slip in and out thanks to large door openings and narrow sills. Rear-seat denizens benefit from seatbacks that are nearly flush with the body structure \u2014 no need to scoot forward to exit. But taller rear occupants may have to duck on the way in because the roof slopes down. The seats are nicely adjustable for routine use, but they lack the bolstering necessary to hold the driver in place for sporty driving. But we're more concerned about the insufficient steering-wheel telescoping range; the wheel doesn't pull back far enough for taller drivers. There's ample room for 6-footers to occupy the front and rear rows at the same time, although wider passengers may feel as if they're sitting close to the doors. Rear seats have generous toe space. But the overall feeling of roominess is lessened a bit by the bulbous dash and bulky center console. The low cowl and sloping hood provide a generous view, but it is hard to locate the corners when parking nose-in. The split rear window can be distracting, and cargo can easily obstruct the view. Thick roof pillars create big rear blind spots. You will rely on the camera system and parking sensors. The Prime uses a mix of metal and composites to minimize weight, but the results don't feel cheap or poorly made. It features tight panel gaps, and all the interior pieces feel connected and solid. But certain glossy plastic accent pieces may not agree with everyone. There's ample space for your odds and ends. The standard smartphone charging tray is large and functional, and it's handy even if you don't use it for charging. It has a deep center console that can swallow an SLR camera with a lens and door pockets that can hold medium-size water bottles. The large battery pack takes a big bite out of cargo capacity because it raises the floor considerably. Something as routine as a grocery bag will be too tall to fit under the security cover and will obstruct visibility through the rear window. The lower LATCH points are easily accessed underneath a flap of seat fabric, while the top tethers are a little harder to get. The large rear door openings are convenient, but the low roofline toward the rear of the door may make accessing rear-facing seats harder. The audio interface is fairly easy to use, and the JBL sound system is adequate. The touch panel volume adjuster is atrocious; use the steering controls instead. The navigation system is excessively restrictive about what you can do while in motion, and its fonts and graphic design are old. It has Bluetooth streaming audio, a cover art display, and a USB jack for iPhones and Android devices. But Toyota does not support the newer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto interfaces, preferring instead to use its own proprietary Entune system, which isn't nearly as intuitive. The Prime has effective blind-spot monitoring, lane departure warning and rear cross-traffic alert systems. It's also equipped with adaptive cruise control, but it turns off automatically as the car slows down past 23 mph with just two subtle beeps. Use it only for highway cruising. The Prime's voice control system is slow, but ultimately it's easy to use if you take the time to let it learn your voice. Once you know what words and phrases to use for each function, it can be very accurate for navigation, entertainment and even climate settings. For all-around value, we recommend  the Premium trim level. Like every  Prius Prime, it has an impressive electric-only range and top-tier fuel  economy. But it comes with features that you'll appreciate having, such as the  large 11.6-inch touchscreen, upgraded cabin materials, a power-adjustable  driver's seat, keyless access and start for all four doors, and wireless  smartphone charging. All  Prius Primes have a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine paired to a plug-in hybrid  system. Total system output is 121 horsepower, which drives the front wheels  through a specialized continuously variable automatic transmission. The EPA  estimates the Prime can drive up to 25 miles using pure electric power. Fully  charging the battery takes 5 hours and 30 minutes using a 120-volt power source  or a little more than 2 hours with 240 volts.The Plus trim level starts you out with  15-inch wheels, LED headlights, automatic climate control, keyless access  (driver's door only) and start, heated front seats, a 7-inch touchscreen,  Bluetooth, a USB port, and a six-speaker sound system with satellite radio. A  suite of driver safety aids, called Toyota Safety Sense P, is also standard and  includes adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking, lane departure warning and lane keeping assist, and  automatic high beams.Stepping  up one rung to the Premium trim  level puts you into the Prius Prime's sweet spot. It includes a power driver's  seat, an 11.6-inch central touchscreen and upgraded infotainment system,  simulated leather (SofTex) upholstery, keyless entry on the other three doors,  satellite radio and wireless smartphone charging.The Advanced trim level adds on a  premium audio system, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, a  heated steering wheel, an auto-dimming mirror, a head-up display, a smartphone  app with a charge management system and remote-control climate operation, automatic  wipers and a semiautomated parking function.",

    "full_description": "For 2011 the Toyota Highlander Hybrid gets new styling updates, a few more standard features, better fuel economy and 10 more horsepower. Combining seven-passenger seating with excellent fuel economy and performance, the 2011 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a very appealing alternative to conventional crossovers. If you're like most folks, you probably think that  midsize SUVs aren't exactly fuel sippers. And you'd be mostly right. But did  you know that there is a seven-passenger, midsize crossover SUV that earns an  EPA combined estimate of 28 mpg while also packing 280 horses worth of  performance? Well, there is now, and it's the 2011 Toyota Highlander Hybrid.  Its impressive mileage rating represents a 2-mpg improvement compared to last  year's Highlander Hybrid and is about 50 percent better than the 17-19 combined  mpg that you'd get in a typical, gas-only midsizer.\nOther improvements for the 2011 Toyota Highlander  Hybrid include more power via a larger V6 engine (3.5 liters versus 3.3  liters), more standard features and updated styling. The latter includes a  number of features that distinguish it from the non-hybrid Highlander, such as a  unique grille and front bumper, color-keyed rocker panels with chrome accents  and a light blue tint for the headlights and taillights. This year also brings  more standard features for the base trim, including a power driver seat, an  upgraded audio system, rear climate control and a standard third-row seat (that  thankfully now features a 50/50 split/folding design that allows for  greater cargo/passenger flexibility). The Limited trim also gets a few new  standard perks in the form of perforated leather seating and tri-zone automatic  climate control.\nCompared to other hybrid SUVs, the Highlander Hybrid  rates just 1 mpg less in combined driving than the much smaller, five-passenger  Ford Escape Hybrid, and 7 mpg better than the full-size, truck-based 2011 Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid (and its GMC  Yukon Hybrid twin) that doesn't offer much more in the way of cargo or  passenger space. The Highlander Hybrid is also very quick for a large crossover  -- expect a 0-60 mph time in the mid 7-second range.\nAs  far as downsides, there are a few. The third-row seat is really only suited for  kids, so if you need to carry more than five adult-sized people on a regular  basis, the Tahoe/Yukon hybrids or something like the 2011 Ford Flex will be  preferable. Then there's the price. Though about $12,000 less than the big GM  hybrids, the Hybrid is about $7,000 more than a base Highlander with the V6 and  AWD -- it'll take quite a few years to make that all back on fuel savings alone.  Lastly, the Highlander Hybrid's AWD system is powered by a separate electric  motor, so it's theoretically less capable in snowy conditions than the  full-fledged gasoline AWD Highlander.\nBut  all things considered, the 2011 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is easy to recommend  to anyone looking to significantly reduce their fuel consumption and carbon  footprint without sacrificing true SUV-grade functionality.  Powering  the 2011 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a hybrid system consisting of a 3.5-liter  V6 gasoline engine and a trio of electric motors. It all adds up to a healthy 280  hp, which is transferred to the pavement via a continuously variable automatic  transmission (CVT) and an all-wheel-drive system that uses a separate electric  motor to power the rear wheels when there's a need for extra traction or  acceleration.\nIn  Edmunds performance testing, the updated Highlander Hybrid went from zero to 60  mph in 7.4 seconds, which is pretty quick even by conventional crossover  standards. Properly equipped, the Highlander Hybrid can also tow trailers up to  3,500 pounds.\nThis  muscle is even more impressive considering its EPA fuel economy estimates of 28  mpg city/28 mpg highway and 28 mpg in combined driving. The  2011 Toyota Highlander Hybrid comes standard with antilock disc brakes,  stability control, front side airbags, active front-seat head restraints, a  driver knee airbag and full-length side curtain airbags. Also standard is a hill-start  assist feature that keeps the vehicle from rolling backward when starting off  on a steep incline. In Edmunds brake testing, the Highlander Hybrid came to a  stop from 60 mph in a tidy 120 feet.\nIn  government crash testing, the Highlander Hybrid received a perfect five stars  for driver protection and four stars for front passenger protection in frontal  impacts. Side-impact testing yielded five-star ratings front and back. The  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the conventional Highlander its top  \"Good\" ratings in both frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. The  2011 Toyota Highlander Hybrid features a smooth ride and secure if uninspiring handling.  Road noise is nicely suppressed, and engine noise is reduced to a barely  perceptible electric hum when the gas engine shuts off. The hybrid powertrain's  lively performance and seamless transition between gas and electric modes adds  spice and character as well as efficiency. A driver-selectable \"EV\"  mode can propel the Highlander for short distances at low speeds on battery  power alone, and hitting the \"Econ\" button softens throttle response  to improve fuel economy. While  the 2011 Toyota Highlander Hybrid's powertrain gets most of the attention, the  cabin deserves its fair share of praise. In addition to seating up to seven  passengers, the interior features quality materials and a user-friendly control  layout. The 40/20/40-split second-row seat slides fore and aft and features  reclining seatbacks. It also incorporates a removable center section that can  be replaced with a handy center table or stowed away to permit minivan-like  walk-through access to the third row.\nThe  optional third-row seat is cramped compared to those of some larger crossovers,  but it's useful for kids, and adults of shorter stature can squeeze back there  for short trips. For 2011, it's split 50/50 to offer additional flexibility  when carrying a mix of people and cargo.\nFor  hauling purposes, the Highlander Hybrid offers a maximum of 94 cubic feet of  cargo room with the second- and third-row seats folded. There's a healthy 42  cubic feet of stowage behind the second-row seatbacks. \nThe  base model comes fitted with 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights,  foglamps, keyless ignition/entry, cloth upholstery, an eight-way power driver seat,  a 40/20/40 split-folding/sliding/reclining second-row seat with removable  center seat, a 50/50 split-folding third-row seat, cargo area-mounted releases  for folding down the second-row seats, a tilt-and-telescoping steering column, air-conditioning  (with rear climate control), a rearview camera and a six-speaker audio system  with CD/MP3 player, satellite radio, an iPod/USB interface and Bluetooth  connectivity/streaming audio.\nSpring  for the Highlander Hybrid Limited and you get 19-inch alloy wheels, a roof rack,  additional chrome exterior trim, power-folding/heated outside mirrors (with  puddle lamps), a power liftgate (with a flip-up rear window), a sunroof,  keyless ignition/entry, perforated leather upholstery, power-adjustable heated  front seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel (with audio and climate controls),  tri-zone automatic climate control, a rear cargo area cover, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror and wood-grain cabin accents.\nOptions  for the base Highlander Hybrid include 19-inch alloy wheels, a power liftgate,  an upgraded JBL sound system (with six-CD changer and subwoofer), a navigation system  (includes the JBL sound system but with a four-CD changer), a rear seat DVD  entertainment system, a Cold Weather package (heated sideview mirrors and windshield  wiper de-icer) and a Leather package (includes the leather upholstery, steering-wheel-mounted  audio controls, heated front seats, the sunroof and the auto-dimming rearview  mirror).\nThe  Limited can be had with the JBL sound system, the navigation system and the rear  seat DVD entertainment system.",

    "full_description": "The 2013 Toyota Avalon is fully redesigned and now offers a hybrid variant.  With new features and a fresh look, the 2013 Toyota Avalon Hybrid should earn new respect as a top choice for a full-size hybrid sedan. Somewhere along Toyota's laser-focused path to increased  sales, the company forgot about building cars that connected to drivers on both  practical and emotional levels. But the recently redesigned Camry sent the  first signal that Toyota was serious about making engaging cars  again, and now the 2013 Avalon Hybrid further reinforces the automaker's new  priorities.\nThe 2013 Toyota Avalon Hybrid is, as the name suggests, the  gas-electric version of the fully redesigned Avalon. Like its conventional  gasoline-only counterpart, the hybrid shares a striking new look for Toyota's  big sedan. Combined with roof pillars that sweep gracefully to the trunk -- not  unlike the Cadillac XTS or Jaguar XJ -- and a rear end pulled together with LED  taillamps extending into the trunk lid, the new Avalon looks sleeker in profile  and makes an impression -- something we can't say about its sleepy predecessor.\nThe front-wheel-drive Avalon is wider, lower and more than 2  inches shorter than before. A stiffer body and revised suspension settings give  the Avalon more assured handling. Smaller dimensions mean slightly less  interior room, but the Avalon compensates with a larger trunk, a greater range  of seat adjustments and more efficient sunroof packaging.\nUnder the hood of the Avalon Hybrid is a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder gasoline engine paired with an electric motor -- the same  combination found in the new Camry -- that generates 200 horsepower. More  importantly, it helps the Avalon Hybrid return an EPA-estimated 40 combined mpg.  Fitted with a 17-gallon fuel tank, the Avalon Hybrid can theoretically cover  more than 600 miles between fill-ups. That's the kind of range we normally  associate with diesel engines.\nOverall, the new 2013 Toyota Avalon Hybrid's excellent fuel  economy, distinctive new look and business-class interior result in a pretty impressive  package. It also happens to be pretty much in a class by itself, as few  automakers currently offer full hybrid systems in their large non-luxury sedans.  As alternatives, though, you could look at the new Ford Fusion Hybrid and Lincoln MKZ Hybrid.  Both are a little smaller inside the Avalon, but are impressive nonetheless. Volkswagen's Passat  with the diesel engine would be another, less costly option.\nAdditional competition will come within the next two years as  models like the Chevrolet Impala and Passat will feature hybrids among their  lineups. For now, the 2013 Toyota Avalon Hybrid merits strong consideration as  a roomy, long-distance fuel-sipper. The 2013 Toyota Avalon Hybrid is powered by a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder that generates 156 hp and 156 pound-feet of torque. An electric  motor brings the gas engine to life when it shuts down at stoplights in order  to save fuel and also provides some low-end propulsion. Combined, the two power  units are good for 200 hp. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) delivers  power to the front wheels.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, an Avalon Hybrid Limited  accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds, a quick time for a full-size  sedan. According to EPA estimates, the Avalon Hybrid returns 40 mpg city/39 mpg  highway and 40 mpg combined. Standard safety features for the 2013 Toyota Avalon Hybrid  include traction and stability control, antilock disc brakes, front and rear  seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and front knee airbags. Limited models  also come with blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. An adaptive  cruise control system with pre-collision warning is optional on the Limited. \nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Avalon Hybrid stopped from 60  mph in 132 feet, which is about average for the segment. The first thought when driving the 2013 Toyota Avalon Hybrid  might be: \"Is this really the Avalon?\" The redesign has also yielded a  personality change. The stiffer body and retuned suspension deliver an assured  but comfortable ride, and the Avalon has shed its tendency to wallow around  faster bends in the road. Some traditional Avalon buyers might still wish for  the old, softer Avalon, but overall we like the change.\nThe Avalon's 200 hp moves the sedan's nearly 3,600-pound  mass with some authority. In Edmunds acceleration tests, the Avalon Hybrid trailed  a V6-powered Hyundai Azera by just two-tenths of a second. The Hybrid is also  exceptionally quiet, equaling the hushed state of a large luxury sedan while on  the highway. The Avalon Hybrid's interior is spacious, elegant and uses high-quality  materials throughout. The unusual layered dash layout divides the instrument  panel, center console and front passenger area into different zones, appearing  almost floating or disconnected when viewed from certain angles. It's a  slightly modern and futuristic effect, but takes some getting used to. Controls  are intuitively arranged and nicely weighted for a quality feel, however.\nThe front seats are very comfortable, offering a wide range  of adjustment, and even feature lumbar support for both the driver and front  passenger. The Avalon's rear seats are so roomy that Toyota actually offers a  livery model of this car. The trunk offers 14 cubic feet of space, which is  less than the regular Avalon but still more than what's available from the  typical midsize hybrid sedan.\nGauges are sharp and stylish and the center screen is large  and easy to read for navigation directions or vehicle operation information.  Storage compartments are especially well placed and executed and provide ample  room for drinks and personal effects. The lower section of the center console  provides a convenient \"eBin\" with power cords passing through a  sliding panel for two cell phones and auxiliary and USB connections. A large  center armrest provides more storage space and additional connectivity and  charging for cell phones. \nThe XLE Premium comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels,  automatic headlights, heated mirrors, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, dual-zone  automatic climate control, full power accessories, cruise control, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, leather upholstery, an eight-way power  driver seat with power lumbar support, a four-way power front passenger seat  and heated front seats. Electronic features include keyless ignition/entry,  Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a rearview camera, a 6-inch touchscreen  display and an eight-speaker audio system with a CD player, an auxiliary audio  jack and a USB/iPod interface.\nThe XLE Touring adds foglights, driver seat and side mirror  memory functions, a navigation system and Toyota's Entune smartphone app  integration system.\nThe Limited bundles Premium and Touring features with xenon  headlights, LED daytime running lights, auto-dimming side mirrors, rain-sensing  wipers, upgraded leather upholstery, a 10-way power driver seat, an eight-way  power passenger seat, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, tri-zone automatic climate control,  a rear power sunshade, a 7-inch touchscreen display and an 11-speaker JBL  premium sound system. Adaptive cruise control and adaptive high beam headlights  are optional for the Limited.",

    "full_description": "SUVs have been dominating the market  recently to that point that Ford recently announced it was going to largely  give up on making sedans. But there is one area where the traditional four-door  holds an advantage: hybrid efficiency. The latest hybrid sedans are posting  truly impressive fuel economy, and a great example is the fully redesigned 2019  Toyota Avalon Hybrid. The Avalon Hybrid debuts alongside the  conventionally powered Avalon and is estimated by the EPA to return up to 44  mpg in combined driving. That's almost 70 percent better than the gasoline-only  Avalon, yet the Hybrid costs only about $1,000 more. With what you'll save on  gas, you could very well recoup that added cost in just over a year and  continue to reap the rewards thereafter. From behind the wheel, the Hybrid's  power deficit isn't as much of a penalty as the numbers suggest, making it our  pick in the Avalon lineup.The  2019 Avalon Hybrid won't force sacrifices elsewhere either. The hybrid  batteries are mounted under the rear seats, maintaining the same trunk capacity  as the conventional Avalon while keeping the flat-folding rear seatbacks for  greater versatility. Both offer high levels of comfort and plenty of features  and blur the line between Toyota and its Lexus luxury brand.If  you're in the market for a large sedan, the 2019 Toyota Avalon Hybrid should be  among your top picks whether or not you're looking for a hybrid.  Even though sedans are being overshadowed by SUVs, Toyota's all-new 2019 Avalon Hybrid has the potential to shine. It has plenty of room, it's impressively efficient, and it has the kind of features and refinement to compete with more expensive luxury models. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our first drive of  the 2019 Toyota Avalon Hybrid (2.5L  inline-4 hybrid | CVT automatic | FWD). The Avalon Hybrid has more than enough power to get up to highway speeds without laboring. And as big sedans go \u2014 or big hybrid sedans, for that matter \u2014 the Avalon is respectably buttoned-down when driving around turns. Both the suspension and the seats are designed with comfort in mind. Ruts and bumps are smoothed over well, and the cabin remains pleasantly quiet on the highway. The front seats are pleasantly comfortable, with little side bolstering for easy entry and exit. The cockpit is attractive and fitted with high-quality materials, though the blocky center stack looks a little out of place. But the sunroof that is standard on all but the base Avalon does cut into headroom. Apple CarPlay finally makes it into a Toyota with this Avalon. Unfortunately, Android Auto is still absent and the built-in Entune infotainment system remains as one of the least intuitive in the industry. On the upside, the Avalon Hybrid has plenty of standard driver safety aids. The 2019 Toyota Avalon in Limited trim should satisfy the typical  large-sedan buyer. It forgoes the sporty touches of the XSE model in favor of  more Lexus-like luxurious refinement. It's also the only trim eligible for rear  parking sensors with cross-traffic braking and a surround-view camera. Standard  features for the base XLE include  17-inch alloy wheels, automatic LED headlights, heated mirrors, keyless entry  and ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated and power-adjustable  front seats, simulated leather upholstery, 60/40-split folding rear seats and  an auto-dimming rearview mirror.On  the technology front, the XLE comes with Bluetooth, a Wi-Fi hotspot, Toyota's  Safety Connect communications, a 9-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera,  Toyota's Entune infotainment system with smartphone-based navigation, four USB  ports, Apple CarPlay, and an eight-speaker audio system with satellite and HD  radio. Also  included is Toyota's Safety Sense suite of advanced safety features (forward  collision warning with automatic braking, lane keeping assist, automatic high  beams and adaptive cruise control) as well as a blind-spot monitor with rear  cross-traffic alert.The Limited trim adds 18-inch wheels,  upgraded exterior lighting, a sunroof, a head-up display, leather upholstery,  ventilated front seats, driver-seat memory settings, heated rear seats, a  heated steering wheel, wood interior trim, ambient interior lighting, a  wireless charging pad, a built-in navigation system and a 14-speaker premium  JBL audio system.The  sporty XSE trim builds on the XLE's  features with 18-inch wheels, piano black exterior treatments, a rear spoiler,  a sunroof, paddle shifters, aluminum pedal covers, aluminum interior trim and  microsuede seat inserts. Some  of features on the Limited are available on the other trims as options. An  Advanced Safety package with a surround-view parking camera system and rear  parking sensors with automatic braking is optional on the Limited.",

    "full_description": "American car shoppers have traditionally  shown a tepid interest in small hatchbacks, especially since small crossover  SUVs have become so popular. So it might come as a bit of a surprise to learn  that Toyota has decided to kick off its newest Corolla generation in this  unloved body style. The 2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback is all-new, while its  sedan sibling carries forward on previous-generation hardware. (An updated  sedan is due for the 2020 model year.)  \nImprovements  this year include edgy styling, a well-appointed interior and surprisingly  enjoyable performance. A 7.8-second 0-60 mph time shows the Corolla is packing  heat this time around, too \u2014 the outgoing Corolla sedan took a  lethargic 10 seconds to make the same run. And as is the case with most Toyotas  now, a healthy complement of advanced driver safety features, including forward  collision warning and adaptive cruise control, come standard. \nOur  main concern relates to something you wouldn't typically expect to be an issue:  utility. The Corolla Hatchback's cargo area is only slightly larger than the  sedan's, and rival hatchbacks offer up to 50 percent more capacity. But on the  whole, this new Corolla is a strong contender. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the Toyota Corolla Hatchback XSE (2.0L inline-4 | 6-speed manual | FWD). Power isn't overwhelming, but the smooth-revving engine is fun and willing to pull right to redline every time. The distinct lack of low-end torque makes quick getaways difficult. In Edmunds testing, our Corolla Hatchback test car accelerated from 0-60 mph in 7.8 seconds. The brake pedal makes smooth stops a breeze thanks to the right amount of pedal stroke and decent feel. Panic braking from 60 mph in our testing revealed good consistency and a stopping distance of about 125 feet. The steering doesn't provide a lot of feel, but its weighting is spot-on. The steering response is quick and accurate, too. Overall, the Corolla Hatchback makes a sporty initial impression. The Corolla's suspension is well-tuned. On a twisty road, it's surprisingly fun and engaging to drive. Tire grip is ultimately modest. But with better tires and a limited-slip differential, it would be an exceptionally fun handler. It's nearly impossible to pull away from a stop smoothly because of the slow clutch and throttle calibration. The best way to be smooth is to shift quickly. The shifter lever is quick but also slightly loose and notchy. The heated front seats of the XSE will appeal to a variety of drivers. They are fairly comfortable even on long journeys. There's even a decent amount of support for enthusiastic driving. The rear seats are firm but not overly so, and the seatback angle is agreeable. The 18-inch wheels of the Corolla Hatchback XSE can make the ride quality choppy on rough roads, but overall the ride is surprisingly supple. It feels a tick soft when driving over freeway undulations, but the body stays well under control. There's suitable composure when you're driving hard. Overall, the Corolla Hatchback is pretty quiet. The engine is smooth and doesn't provide any untoward vibrations at higher revs. The side windows are the source of the only wind noise, which intrudes into the cabin at higher speeds. The tires can get pretty noisy on coarse surfaces. The little buttons are a bit difficult to press without a second glance. That said, the climate control unit is very space-efficient and certainly does its part to make the interior look more upscale. Airflow is good for all passengers. Though it might take a minute to decipher the new-for-Toyota button arrangement, the interior quickly makes sense. The climate control buttons are a bit crowded, and the infotainment buttons are a bit small. Instrumentation is clear but could use more information in its digital display. There's ample access to the front seats thanks to a large door opening. The seat height makes getting in and out a breeze. Taller rear-seat passengers will need to watch their heads. The compact nature of the Corolla means the rear door opening isn't anywhere near as generous as the front's. Adjustments can be made quickly. Drivers of varying sizes will be able to get comfortable behind the wheel. There's a decent amount of adjustment from the tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, too. Front passengers have more than enough room all around, but taller occupants will steal most of the legroom from rear-seat passengers. There's ample shoulder room in the rear, and the back of the front seats are cut away to allow for a bit more rear-seat knee room. Even so, taller passengers will still be cramped. As you'd expect from a small hatchback, there's great visibility in every direction. A low hoodline aids forward visibility while plenty of side glass makes lane changes stress-free. The rear headrests can block the already small-ish rear window, but the headrests can be removed when not in use. In XSE trim, the Corolla Hatchback is trimmed with simulated leather and contrasting stitching on the seats and dashboard. Panel fit is good, and the climate controls and touchscreen go a long way toward pushing the interior upmarket. The door pockets and cupholders provide decent room for a small assortment of items. In front of the shift lever, there's a shelf that looks to be for a smartphone, but it's not really big enough to hold one. The center console bin is also a bit small and awkward to reach into. An almost comically high load floor takes much of the practicality out of this hatchback. With the seats up, the cargo space is short and shallow, amounting to only 17.8 cubic feet. For comparison, competitors such as the Kia Forte and the Hyundai Elantra GT offer more. The LATCH anchors are protected by plastic covers and are easily accessible at the base of the outboard rear seats. Large rear-facing infant car seats might necessitate moving the front seats forward, but a parent's access to the back seats is good. Toyota's Entune system continues to frustrate. Even with the high-mounted 8-inch screen, the layout, various speed-related lockouts, and the lack of a native navigation system for cars equipped with a manual transmission make for a frustrating experience. The decent audio system helps, but other cars do this much better. There's one USB port under the dash for Apple CarPlay connection. Bluetooth connectivity is standard, and Amazon Alexa is also supported. Android users are out of luck and will be forced to download a proprietary navigation app for any route guidance. The Corolla hatch comes standard with automated emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, auto high-beam control, lane keeping assistance and more. If you opt for the CVT automatic, you also get lane centering assistance and an upgraded adaptive cruise that can bring the car down to a full stop. The voice recognition system is reasonably accurate so long as you follow the tutorial and set up the system to recognize your voice. It can be a bit time-consuming. But once this process is completed, commands are usually identified correctly. We  think the CVT automatic-equipped SE with Preferred package is a good combo with  lots of features and a low out-the-door cost. However, the XSE is only slightly more expensive, and its larger wheels and  wider tires make it the driver's choice in the lineup. Heated front seats and  dual-zone climate control make it a little more pleasant for occupants, too. \nStandard  equipment for the SE includes  16-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, heated mirrors, a driver information  display, automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a  height-adjustable driver's seat, a 60/40-split folding rear bench, Bluetooth, a  Wi-Fi hotspot, voice controls, an 8-inch touchscreen, and a six-speaker audio  system with two USB ports and Apple CarPlay.\nStandard  safety features include Toyota Safety Connect emergency communications,  automatic high-beam control, adaptive cruise control, a forward collision  warning system (with pedestrian and cyclist detection plus automatic emergency  braking), and lane keeping assist.\nSE  models with the CVT automatic also get steering wheel-mounted shift paddles,  lane centering assist, and a version of the adaptive cruise control system that  can bring the Corolla to a complete stop (the manual-equipped version  deactivates at low speeds). Selecting the CVT automatic also opens the door to  the SE Preferred package, which adds  a blind-spot monitor, HD and satellite radio, and Toyota's Entune app services.\nCompared  to the SE, the XSE adds 18-inch  wheels, LED foglights, a chrome grille, an upgraded driver information display,  dual-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable driver's seat, heated  front seats, leather upholstery with cloth inserts, HD and satellite radio, and  Toyota's Entune app services. \nModels  equipped with the CVT automatic also get the blind-spot monitor. The CVT  automatic's optional XSE Preferred package  further adds a wireless charging pad, a navigation system and an eight-speaker  JBL premium audio system. This package can be ordered with or without adaptive  headlights.",

    "full_description": "For 2011, the Toyota RAV4 sees only minor changes to standard equipment and option packages. Spacious, comfortable and easy to drive, the 2011 Toyota RAV4 is a top pick for a small-to-midsize crossover SUV, especially if you want a V6 or a usable kid-size third-row seat. With so many compact crossover SUVs on the market today, it's  hard to remember which brand created the idea of a small, car-based SUV. Yet it  was Toyota with its then-diminutive Celica-based RAV4 that created the segment  some 15 years ago, beating the rival Honda CR-V to the punch.\nOf course, using the words \"small\" or \"compact\"  is a bit of a stretch today, as the 2011 Toyota RAV4 is closer to a midsize  crossover in terms of exterior dimensions. But Toyota has found a way to offer  all that space (with seating for up to seven) while still providing impressive  fuel efficiency. Indeed, today's bigger RAV4 powered by its available  269-horsepower V6 actually surpasses the fuel-economy rating of the original  RAV4 with its 120-hp four-cylinder -- it delivers 1 mpg more in EPA-rated combined  driving.\nOne of the RAV4's strengths is its  ability to effortlessly make the transition from an accommodating family  runabout to a pack mule. There are useful storage spaces throughout the  interior and the rear seats flip down to create a cargo hold more capacious  than even the midsize Ford Edge. Passenger space is also pretty good, with an  optional third-row seat capable of accommodating a pair of kids. Add in the  aforementioned powerful yet thrifty V6 and you can see why the RAV4 has been a  favorite of Edmunds over the past few years.\nThat said, the RAV4 is one of the  older designs in the compact crossover segment. The 2011 Chevy Equinox has  a more upscale look and feel as well as a roomier backseat, while the 2011 Honda CR-V is a bit  nicer inside the cabin and more responsive to driver commands as well. The 2011 Kia Sorento is also  more engaging when you're behind the wheel, while the 2011 Subaru Forester is  notable for its available turbocharged punch. Still, the veteran 2011 Toyota  RAV4 is so well rounded that you'd be remiss if you didn't have it on your test-drive  list. The 2011 Toyota RAV4 comes standard with a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine that delivers 179 hp and 172 pound-feet of torque. A four-speed automatic transmission is standard. Fuel economy for this model with front-wheel drive is 22 mpg city/28 mpg highway and 24 mpg combined, and 21/27/24 with 4WD.\nA 3.5-liter V6 with a five-speed automatic transmission is optional for all trim levels of the RAV4. It produces 269 hp and 246 lb-ft of torque. In Edmunds performance testing, the RAV4 V6 4WD delivers a time from a standstill to 60 mph of 7.2 seconds -- quick for the segment. The V6 achieves an impressive 19 mpg city/27 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined for the front-wheel-drive RAV4, and these ratings change only by 1 mpg less for EPA highway when the 4WD model is selected.\nEvery RAV4 trim level can be matched with either front-wheel or four-wheel drive. In 4WD models, power is sent to the front wheels until tire slippage is detected and then power is also directed to the rear wheels. The torque split can be manually locked at 50 percent front/50 percent rear for driving in poor traction conditions, such as gravel or snow. With the optional tow package, the RAV4 V6 can pull as much as 3,500 pounds. Antilock disc brakes, stability control, traction control, whiplash-reducing front headrests, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags are standard on every 2011 Toyota RAV4. Vehicles equipped with the V6 and/or the optional third-row seats also come with hill-start assist and hill-descent control.\nIn crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the RAV4 earns a final rating of three stars, with three stars for overall front crash protection and four stars for overall side-impact protection. The RAV4 also performs well in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests, earning the top rating of \"Good\" in both the frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. It achieves the second-best rating of \"Acceptable\" in the roof strength test. Although relatively capable off the beaten path, the 2011 Toyota RAV4 is meant for a life on pavement. Its taut suspension and precise electric-assist steering make daily errands a pleasant (although not particularly interesting) experience.\nThe RAV4 is not as responsive to control inputs as the Honda CR-V or Kia Sorento, but the Toyota does offer a smooth ride that's forgiving enough for commuters who drive on crumbling expressways. Road noise can be an issue at times, but wind noise is well controlled.\nIf we were to buy a 2011 Toyota RAV4, it would have to come with the optional V6, which generates nearly 100 hp more than the inline-4 engines offered by other models in this segment and yet also matches these four-cylinders in fuel economy. The RAV's four-cylinder version is a reasonable choice for most buyers, though, as it provides adequate power for day-to-day driving. The RAV4's interior boasts a clean design with large, simple controls and lots of storage space. Overall interior quality is acceptable, but the Chevy Equinox and Honda CR-V make the RAV's interior look too insubstantial and budget-oriented.\nNevertheless, the Toyota RAV4 is a model of practicality. The rear seats recline and can slide fore and aft to optimize passenger space or cargo capacity. Normal seating capacity is five, while the optional third-row seat bumps it to seven. Though this seat is meant only for children, it is at least reasonably sturdy and spacious.\nTo configure the RAV4 for cargo, all you need to do is flip a lever on the second-row seats. There is no need to remove headrests or fold up seat cushions to get a flat load floor, and the result is an impressive 73 cubic feet of cargo capacity. The load floor is also quite low for this class, which minimizes the strain of loading a week's worth of groceries or makes it easy for a dog to climb aboard. However, the Toyota's tailgate can be an inconvenience when you're parked on the street, as it has hinges on the right side, the opposite of what you want for curbside loading in the U.S. \nThe base RAV4 comes standard with 16-inch steel wheels, a limited-slip differential (front-drive models only), air-conditioning, cruise control, full power accessories, keyless entry, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, height-adjustable driver seat and a six-speaker stereo with CD player and auxiliary audio jack. The base V6 4WD adds 17-inch cast-aluminum wheels.\nThe RAV4 Sport comes standard with 18-inch cast-aluminum wheels, color-keyed bumpers and sportier suspension tuning. The Sport Appearance package that is available on all four-cylinder and V6 4WD Sport models deletes the spare tire mounted on the rear cargo door (the model features run-flat tires instead) and adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated mirrors and chrome exterior details.\nThe RAV4 Limited switches to the regular suspension and 17-inch cast-aluminum wheels, and adds automatic headlights (optional on the Sport), heated mirrors, hard-shell cover for the spare tire, roof rails, keyless ignition/entry, dual-zone automatic climate control and an upgraded stereo with a six-disc CD changer and satellite radio (optional on base and Sport models). All V6 models add hill-start assist and hill-descent control, which are also standard for the RAV4 four-cylinder with the optional third-row seat.\nMost of the RAV4's options are grouped into packages, and their content and availability differs by the region of the U.S. in which the vehicle is offered. A third-row seat is optional on all models, as is a back-up camera with a display mounted in the rearview mirror. An Upgrade Value package for the base RAV4 includes a sunroof, roof rails, privacy glass, 17-inch cast-aluminum wheels, six-disc CD changer, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, upgraded cloth upholstery and a cargo cover. Options available on the Sport and Limited include a sunroof, a touchscreen navigation system and a premium nine-speaker JBL stereo with Bluetooth.\nThe Premium package available on the Sport and Limited trim levels (though not with the third-row seat) adds leather upholstery and an eight-way power driver seat with power lumbar support. The latter item can be added separately on the Limited. V6-powered models can be equipped with a tow package.",

    "full_description": "Following a full redesign last year, the 2015 Corolla adds a fold-down rear center armrest to all trim levels except the base L. The \"Premium\" sub-trims also receive the Driver Convenience package as standard. The 2015 Toyota Corolla isn't built to excite, but its sensible blend of fuel economy, features, versatility and value make it a compelling choice for typical small sedan shoppers. If the 2015 Toyota Corolla was somehow competing on a  reality TV show it'd probably be voted off in the first few rounds. It's just  not an attention-grabbing kind of car. But for a majority of small sedan  shoppers, having a car that avoids histrionics is exactly the point. If you're somebody  who just wants to set it and forget it with a minimal amount of fuss, chances  are you'll find plenty about the 2015 Corolla that's to your liking.\nComing after a complete overhaul last year, the latest  Corolla's restyled exterior won't exactly blow your hair back, but the fresh interior  is a big step forward, bringing a newfound sense of style along with widely  available niceties like a user-friendly touchscreen and automatic climate  control. The backseat's cavernous legroom gives the compact Corolla  near-midsize passenger space, while the continuously variable transmission  (CVT) enables stellar fuel economy. Throw in the Corolla's pretty high crash  test scores and its historically robust reliability and you've got pretty much  everything most people need and want for a small sedan.\nJust keep in mind that if you value driver engagement, the  Corolla remains one of the least inspiring options in this class. More dynamic  alternatives include the sophisticated and similarly fuel-efficient 2015 Mazda 3 and the  frugal yet fun-to-drive Ford Focus.  Although the 2015  Hyundai Elantra lacks that sporty edge, it does offer ample style at an attractive  price, and the always-popular Honda  Civic and Volkswagen  Jetta have been remade into strong all-around contenders. But considering  its undeniable appeal for the money, this Toyota still earns a solid Edmunds.com \"B\"  rating. Other small cars will steal the headlines, but don't let that  distract you from the 2015 Corolla's fundamental competence. The 2015 Toyota Corolla is powered by a 1.8-liter  four-cylinder engine that comes in two different versions. On every trim level  except the LE Eco, it produces 132 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque. The  LE Eco's more efficient version also makes a little more power, checking in at  140 hp and 126 lb-ft of torque.\nThe base Corolla L comes standard with a six-speed manual  transmission, offering a four-speed automatic as an option. The other trims  feature a continuously variable transmission (CVT), though the S can also be  ordered with the six-speed manual. \nIn Edmunds performance testing, a Corolla LE Eco sauntered  to 60 mph in 9.2 seconds, comparable to a CVT-equipped Honda Civic but nearly a  full second behind the Ford Focus and Mazda 3.\nEPA-estimated  fuel economy varies depending on which Corolla you choose. It checks in at 31 mpg combined (27 city/36 highway) with the four-speed automatic and also 31 mpg combined (28/37) with the six-speed manual. The CVT returns 32 mpg combined (29/38) in the LE and a comparable 32 mpg combined (29/37) in the S. The LE Eco leads the way at 35 mpg combined (30/42) in standard form and 34 mpg combined (30/40) in Plus or Premium form. Standard on every 2015 Toyota Corolla are stability and traction  control, antilock brakes, front side airbags, side curtain airbags, a driver  knee airbag and a passenger seat cushion airbag. A rearview camera is standard  on all trims except the base L.\nNote that most 2015 Corollas feature cheaper rear drum  brakes, with only the S Plus and S Premium upgrading to rear discs. In Edmunds  brake testing, a Corolla LE Eco with the rear drums stopped from 60 mph in 130  feet, a longer than average result.\nIn government crash testing, the Corolla earned the top  overall rating of five stars, including five stars for frontal impacts and  five stars for side impacts. The independent Insurance Institute for Highway  Safety awarded the Corolla its top  rating of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset,  side-impact and roof-strength tests. In the small-overlap frontal-offset test, though,  the Corolla received the second-lowest rating of \"Marginal.\" Its  seat/head restraint design was rated \"Good\" for whiplash protection  in rear impacts. Despite last year's complete redesign, the 2015 Toyota  Corolla delivers much the same driving experience as its predecessor. Partly,  that's down to Toyota's tried-and-true but generally underwhelming 1.8-liter  engine. Acceleration is adequate but nothing more. The LE Eco's version gets  some tweaks that add a few horsepower, but we couldn't detect a difference. We  do like the CVT, as it has computer-simulated \"shifts\" to mitigate  the typical CVT's constant-rpm drone during acceleration. Skip the archaic  four-speed automatic in the base L unless the price is simply too good to pass  up.\nThe Corolla's handling, too, is familiar. Sporty S-trim  touches notwithstanding, there's no playfulness to be found here; instead,  enthusiastic driving around turns is met with a lifeless steering feel and  pronounced body roll. Instead, this car is all about no-hassle commuting  comfort, with a quiet, compliant ride that makes the daily grind seem less  onerous. The current Corolla's cabin is easily the most interesting one  to date, and yes, we realize that's not saying much. Still, it's clear that the  designers were given freer rein this time, and the result is a reasonably  stylish dashboard, accented by un-Corolla-like flourishes such as a sportily contoured  steering wheel and an eye-catching asymmetrical shifter surround. The top priority  remains ease of use, so the various audio interfaces employ tried-and-true knobs  for volume and tuning, while the LE-and-up automatic climate-control panel (a  welcome luxury in this price bracket) consists of a large knob and a few  foolproof buttons.\nAnother pleasant surprise is the 6.1-inch touchscreen  interface, also standard on LE and above, which provides large virtual buttons  and simple, clear graphics. The screen responds quickly to inputs, and its  feature set is generous for an economy car offering. The available Entune App  Suite integrates smartphone-connected services from Bing, Facebook, Yelp and  Pandora, among others, as well as real-time traffic data and sports and stock  information. Note that getting started with Entune can be a bit of a hassle,  since you have to install an app on your phone and register for an account.\nThe Corolla's front seats provide generally adequate comfort,  particularly the S trim's better-bolstered chairs, though some may wish for  more lumbar support. Also, longer-legged drivers could use more range from the  telescoping steering wheel. Thanks in part to a 3.9-inch-longer wheelbase than  the previous Corolla, the current car offers considerably more rear legroom  than most small sedans, if not a commensurate amount of headroom. The middle  rear position is made more hospitable by the nearly flat floor, which lacks the  traditional center \"hump.\" Trunk capacity is average at 13 cubic  feet, but the wide opening facilitates loading and unloading. \nStandard features on the base L model include 15-inch steel  wheels, LED headlights (low beams only) and running lights, powered accessories,  air-conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with auxiliary controls,  a height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split-folding rear seat, Bluetooth  phone connectivity and a four-speaker sound system with a CD player, a USB/iPod  interface and an auxiliary audio jack.\nThe LE adds 16-inch steel wheels, heated mirrors, variable  intermittent wipers, keyless entry, metallic cabin accents, cruise control,  automatic climate control, a rearview camera, a six-speaker sound system with a  6-inch touchscreen display, Bluetooth audio connectivity, phonebook download  capability and voice controls.\nThe LE Plus adds 16-inch alloy wheels, foglights, piano  black interior accents and eligibility for both an optional sunroof and the  Driver Convenience package, which includes the sunroof and adds keyless entry  and ignition, a roof-mounted antenna (versus the standard in-glass antenna), satellite  radio, HD radio, a navigation system and Entune App Suite mobile-app integration.\nGoing with the LE Premium gets you the LE Plus model's  standard and optional features plus a power driver seat, heated front seats and  premium vinyl upholstery.\nThe LE Eco starts with the LE's features and adds  efficiency-maximizing engine and transmission tuning, 15-inch steel wheels with  low-rolling-resistance tires, a rear spoiler and enhanced aerodynamics. The LE  Eco Plus adds special 16-inch alloy wheels, foglights, chrome window trim, an  Eco driving mode and the same options as the LE Plus.

    "full_description": "A pair of special edition TRD packages (Sport and Rock Warrior) debut for the 2009 Toyota Tundra, and a flex-fuel version of the 5.7-liter V8 is now available on four-wheel-drive models. The 2009 Toyota Tundra gets it right in terms of performance, functionality and available configurations. It remains a worthy rival to established domestic models in this highly competitive segment. The 2009 Toyota Tundra is essentially the same truck that made waves three years ago when it arrived on the scene as the first full-range, top-to-bottom overseas threat to the domestic truckmakers. With its robust chassis, wide range of body styles, available 381-horsepower V8, pleasant driving demeanor and distinctive interior, the Tundra set itself apart from the pack. The recently redesigned GM pickups were certainly viable challengers, but after living with both a Tundra and a Silverado in our long-term fleet over the past year, we ultimately determined that the Toyota was the better buy. What a difference a year makes, or rather, what a difference two redesigned competitors make. After ruling the roost for its first couple years of production, the 2009 Toyota Tundra must now contend with the redesigned trucks from Dodge and Ford. Despite this onslaught, the Tundra sticks to its still-mighty guns for 2009, adding only a pair of limited-edition sport and off-road packages. The lineup of three stout engines, three bed lengths and three cab styles remains the same. Notably, the Tundra forgoes a traditional extended cab in favor of two crew-cab flavors: regular Double Cab and jumbo CrewMax. Now that Dodge's Mega Cab is discontinued, no other truck comes close to matching the Tundra CrewMax's rear-seat space.During our long-term test of a Tundra Double Cab, it proved to be a capable workhorse that tackled all our towing, hauling and commuting needs without breaking a sweat. Its strapping 5.7-liter V8 and responsive six-speed automatic consistently impressed, and although the cabin evinced a few ergonomic missteps, it was generally durable, spacious and comfy. On the downside, the Tundra's wide haunches and expansive dashboard make it seem larger than some competitors from behind the wheel. Also, its rear suspension provides a significantly bouncier ride than the sophisticated coil-spring setup found in the new Dodge Ram.The full-size-pickup segment is an embarrassment of riches these days. The new trucks from Dodge and Ford are impressive, but so are the GM full-sizers. In our most recent full-size truck comparison test, the Tundra was narrowed edged out of first place by the Ram. Nonetheless, the 2009 Toyota Tundra remains a well-built and thoroughly competent truck. Make sure it's on your to-drive list if you're shopping for one of these beasts of burden. Three engines are employed for duty underneath the Tundra's sculpted hood, and all versions of the Tundra can be equipped with two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. Standard on the 4x2 Tundra regular cab and standard bed 4x2 Double Cab is a 4.0-liter V6 good for 236 hp and 266 pound-feet of torque. Fuel economy for this engine is 15 mpg city/19 mpg highway and 16 mpg combined. Optional on these models and standard on all other Tundras is a 4.7-liter V8 with 271 hp and 313 lb-ft of torque. Fuel economy with this V8 is 14/17/15 (13/16/15 with 4WD). Both these engines come standard with a five-speed automatic transmission.Optional on all Tundras is a muscular 5.7-liter V8 that produces 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed automatic is standard. This truck is seriously quick, as a Double Cab SR5 4x4 we tested went from zero to 60 mph in just 6.9 seconds. Fuel economy is an estimated 13/17/15 mpg (14/18/16 with two-wheel drive). Properly equipped, the Tundra can tow between 10,100 and 10,800 pounds, depending on driveline and cab style. Antilock disc brakes, traction control, stability control, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags are all standard. In government crash testing, the 2009 Tundra scored four stars out of five in frontal impact tests for both driver and passenger. In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's frontal-offset crash testing, the Tundra earned the highest possible \"Good\" rating. In side impact crash testing, a Tundra Double Cab also achieved a \"Good\" rating. The 5.7-liter V8 makes the 2009 Toyota Tundra one of the quickest pickups on the road, and the engine's delivery is impressively smooth. Shifts from the six-speed automatic transmission are prompt, and the console shifter's precise action makes it easy to use the manual mode while tackling steep highway grades or off-road challenges. The light steering further complements the Tundra's easy-to-drive nature.We were satisfied with the Tundra's ride quality a few years ago, but the new Dodge Ram's rear coil spring suspension and the Ford F-150's sturdier frame make the Tundra seem jiggly by comparison. During our long-term test, rear seat passengers often complained about the choppy ride. Braking distances are a few feet off the pace of competitors, but we've found the Tundra is very good at resisting fade after multiple stops. The 2009 Toyota Tundra has without a doubt the most stylish interior among full-size trucks. However, many of its audio controls are out of comfortable reach for the driver. Meanwhile, each gauge is housed in its own deep tunnel, resulting in less-than-stellar legibility. Materials quality is satisfactory for a full-size pickup, though the same can be said for the Tundra's rivals.The regular cab offers comfortable seats as well as a generous amount of interior cargo space. In Double Cabs, the backseat is fully usable for adults, while the CrewMax offers the roomiest rear seat of any pickup truck. With a limolike 44.5 inches of rear legroom, even 6-footers can stretch out and cross their legs. Standard Grade features include 18-inch steel wheels, a bed light, a 40/20/40-split cloth bench seat, manual accessories, a tilt steering wheel, dual-zone manual climate control and a six-speaker CD stereo with an auxiliary audio jack (four speakers in regular cab). The SR5 adds cruise control, full power accessories, heated mirrors, a console-mounted shifter, front bucket seats (the bench remains an option, returning the shifter to the steering column), a power driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a six-CD changer, keyless entry and rear heater ducts. Many of these options are available on the Grade. The SR5 CrewMax also includes a reclining and sliding rear seat and a power vertical-sliding rear window.The Tundra Limited adds 18-inch alloy wheels, a bed rail system with adjustable tie-downs, front and rear parking sensors, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a power passenger seat, automatic climate control, auto-dimming side mirrors, Bluetooth and a 10-speaker upgraded sound system with a subwoofer (12 speakers with CrewMax).Other options include 20-inch wheels, driver memory functions, a navigation system, a back-up camera, a towing package and a sunroof (CrewMax only). The TRD Off-Road package available on the SR5 and Limited trims adds an off-road-tuned suspension, unique 18-inch alloy wheels, foglamps, front tow hooks and a sliding rear window. The TRD Rock Warrior package adds 17-inch alloy wheels, all-terrain tires, Bilstein shocks, a black cloth interior, foglamps and special exterior detailing and decals (available only on four-wheel-drive 5.7-liter Double Cab standard bed and CrewMax). The TRD Sport package includes 20-inch alloy wheels, a special shift knob and pedals, and unique detailing and decals (available only on two-wheel-drive 5.7-liter regular and Double Cab standard bed models).",

    "full_description": "For 2011, the Toyota Highlander receives a refresh that includes restyled front and rear ends and a few more standard features. Among the latter are a 50/50-split-folding third-row seat and rear climate controls for base and SE trims. Lastly, the Sport trim level has been dropped. The 2011 Toyota Highlander's V6 engine, versatile interior and carlike maneuverability make it a good choice as a do-all family vehicle, though several competitors offer more interior space and utility. When it debuted 10 years ago, the Toyota Highlander  blazed the trail for midsize crossover SUVs. At the time, we wondered whether  people would like this \"Camry wagon\" (the Highlander typically has had  a lot of Camry in its DNA) or continue to stick with truck-based SUVs. Well,  the last decade has pretty much proven that refined carlike crossovers have  prevailed.\nThanks to a quiet, fairly roomy cabin, a V6 engine  that is both smooth and comfortable and a reputation for reliability, the  Highlander has remained one of the most popular midsize crossovers. A refresh for  the 2011 Highlander brings updated styling and additional standard features. A new  third-row seat has a 50/50-split folding design that makes it easier to  configure the vehicle for passenger use or cargo hauling.\nOtherwise,  the 2011 Toyota Highlander stays the course. This means a smooth, quiet ride  and comfortable seating for up to seven passengers (though the third row is a bit  tight compared with some of the Highlander's competition). The Highlander also  boasts a 40/20/40-split second-row seat with a removable center seat that  allows walk-through access to the third row, not to mention the comfort of  captain's chairs with fold-down armrests in the second row.\nWhile  the midsize 2011 Toyota Highlander has a lot going for it, this crossover faces  some stiff competition. The larger crossovers from General Motors -- the 2011 Buick Enclave, 2011 Chevrolet Traverse and 2011 GMC Acadia --  offer more cavernous interiors with seating for up to eight passengers. The 2011 Ford Flex and 2011 Mazda CX-9 also have  their own distinct advantages, as do the totally redesigned Dodge Durango and  Ford Explorer. We suggest checking out these models, but in general we still believe  the Highlander hits the sweet spot between passenger-car comfort and SUV-style  utility. The 2011 Toyota Highlander is available with a choice of two engines. The Base model can be had with a 2.7-liter inline-4 engine that puts out 187 horsepower and 186 pound-feet of torque. Power is sent to the front wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy estimates are 20 mpg city/25 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined.\nOptional for the base and SE and standard for the Highlander Limited is a 3.5-liter V6 that's rated at 270 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. A five-speed automatic and front-wheel drive are standard; all-wheel drive is optional. A Highlander Limited AWD tested by Edmunds sprinted from zero to 60 mph in just 7.5 seconds, performance that makes it one of the quickest crossovers on the road.\nProperly equipped, a Highlander V6 can tow up to 5,000 pounds, another healthy number for this category. With front-wheel drive, the Highlander V6 returns EPA estimates of 18 city/24 highway/20 combined; adding all-wheel drive drops these numbers to 17/22/19. The Highlander comes with a long list of standard safety features including antilock disc brakes, stability control and hill-start assist. All-wheel-drive models also come with hill-descent control, which electronically intervenes with the antilock brakes to control speed on steep, slick surfaces like snow-covered driveways.\nThe Highlander's cabin is fitted with a total of seven airbags, including side-impact airbags for front seat passengers, side curtain airbags that cover all three rows of seats and a driver-side knee airbag. Whiplash-reducing active front head restraints are also standard.\nIn government crash tests, the Highlander earned five stars (the highest possible) for the driver and four stars for the front passenger in frontal impacts, and five stars for side impacts. In tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Highlander received \"Good\" ratings (the highest possible) in both frontal-offset and side impact tests. If you're used to the lumbering trucklike feel of a traditional SUV, the 2011 Toyota Highlander will be a pleasure to drive. The fully independent suspension delivers decent handling, at least by family-hauler standards, and the ride quality is surprisingly smooth. The steering feels light enough for easy parking-lot maneuverability, though it is rather numb and uninspiring compared to its crossover rivals.\nThe 3.5-liter V6 adds to the appeal by providing strong acceleration that makes this 4,000-pound crossover seem smaller than it is. The fact that this powertrain is also among the most fuel-efficient in the category is an added bonus. The 2011 Toyota Highlander features an attractive cabin, especially the top-of-the-line Limited model. Visibility is excellent, while the straightforward layout of gauges and controls makes for refreshingly intuitive operation.\nThe front- and second-row seats are plenty comfortable, but the third-row seat's lack of legroom makes it best suited to pre-teen passengers. The Highlander's second-row bench slides fore and aft and reclines for greater comfort. This seat's unique 40/20/40-split design, which has a removable center section that stows neatly in a special compartment beneath the center console, also makes it easy to access the way-back bench even with a pair of child car seats strapped into the second row.\nWhen you've got cargo to haul, the Highlander offers a healthy 95.4 cubic feet of space with the second- and third-row seatbacks folded down. \nThe entry-level Highlander comes equipped with 17-inch cast-aluminum wheels, rear privacy glass, cloth upholstery, a 40/20/40-split-folding second-row seat that both reclines and slides fore and aft, a 50/50-split-folding third-row seat, air-conditioning (with rear controls), a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and a six-speaker CD stereo with an auxiliary audio jack.\nStep up to the SE and you get a sunroof, power tailgate (with a separate glass hatch), roof rails, foglamps, windshield wiper de-icer, leather upholstery, an eight-way power driver seat, heated front seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, cargo area-mounted releases for folding down the second-row seats, a back-up camera, and an upgraded audio system (optional on base) with satellite radio, a USB port and Bluetooth connectivity/streaming audio.\nThe Limited adds 19-inch cast-aluminum wheels, additional chrome exterior trim and power-folding/heated outside mirrors with puddle lamps. The cabin also gets upgraded leather upholstery, tri-zone automatic climate control, keyless ignition/entry, a 10-way power driver seat, a four-way power passenger seat and wood-grain accents.\nThe Highlander's options list varies by trim level and region, but those available include a towing prep package, an upgraded JBL sound system (with six-disc CD changer and subwoofer), a navigation system (includes the JBL sound system but with a four-disc CD changer) and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.",

    "full_description": "The JBL 3-in-1 audio system has been discontinued, and the sport package receives a unique metal mesh grille and silver sport pedals.  With ample power under the hood, nimble handling on the street and a generous standard features list, the 2005 Toyota RAV4 is a worthy adversary for mini-utes like the Honda CR-V and Ford Escape. In the mid-1990s, the Toyota brain trust took a close look at the SUV market and determined that not everybody liked the idea of piloting a three-ton land yacht in order to take advantage of the \"U\" in SUV. File drawers full of focus group questionnaires pointed toward a vehicle that combined the advantages of a sport-utility -- great visibility, sizable cargo capacity, all-weather capability -- with the manageable size and drivability of a car. With that in mind, Toyota's designers looked past their bulky truck frames and gas-guzzling engines and came up with a car-based SUV that merged trucklike utility with carlike maneuverability. Introduced in 1996, the RAV4 (Recreational Active Vehicle -- four-wheel drive) combined sporty good looks, a convenient size and an economical engine into an attractive and affordable package. It was an instant hit, and as the first example of a car-based sport-utility, the RAV4 enjoyed phenomenal sales that brought with them an onslaught of new competitors hoping to cash in on the newfound niche. Vehicles like the Honda CR-V and Suzuki Grand Vitara soon hit the market sporting bigger engines and more refined interiors, promptly shuffling the aging RAV4 toward the bottom of the category it had single-handedly created. Despite a dose of additional power in 1999, the RAV was getting left behind, and with more competition on the way, Toyota knew a complete redesign was in order to keep its ground-breaking sport-utility at the top of its game. This led to the current-generation RAV4, introduced for 2001. It has a refined look thanks to sharply upswept headlights and crisp lines that stretch the length of the vehicle. Squint hard enough and Toyota's latest mini-ute could even pass for a poor man's BMW X5, sans the neck-snapping V8 of course. Unlike some other SUVs, the RAV4 can't be ordered with a V6. Until last year, the mini-ute's weak, buzzy 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine was a notable disadvantage next the Honda CR-V's larger, more potent 2.4-liter four-cylinder and the Ford Escape's 200-horsepower V6. Toyota responded by installing a larger 2.4-liter engine under the hood that produces 161 hp and 165 pound-feet of torque. Our other main complaint about the RAV4 was its short standard features list that forced buyers to pay extra for basics like air conditioning, cruise and power windows and locks. Now you'll find all of these on the standard equipment list, along with ABS and stability control. Meanwhile, front side-impact airbags and full-length head curtain airbags are on the options list. With these upgrades and freshened styling that's slightly less toylike, this fun-to-drive mini-ute makes great sense as a durable urban runabout and commuter vehicle -- which is just what most people need most of the time. Both 2WD and AWD versions of the RAV4 are powered by a 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine that delivers 161 horsepower and 165 pound-feet of torque. Buyers can choose either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic. Fuel economy is excellent, and buyers can expect to get 22 to 25 mpg in the city and 27 to 31 mpg on the highway. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes are standard, as is Toyota's VSC stability control system. Side airbags for front occupants and full-length side curtain airbags are optional. The RAV4 fared well in government crash tests, earning four out of five stars for frontal impact protection and a perfect five stars for side impacts. It also earned a \"Good\" rating (the highest) in frontal offset and side-impact crash testing by the IIHS (the RAV4 is the first vehicle to earn a \"Best Pick\" designation for both frontal and side-impact tests). One other item of note is the RAV4's lack of a rear bumper. Low-speed crashes that damage the rear of the vehicle can lead to high repair costs. Intended for a life on pavement, the RAV4 really shines in this environment, where its taut suspension, quick steering and tight turning radius come together to produce one of the best-handling SUVs we've ever driven. Minimal body lean and sticky street tires combined with the traction of all-wheel drive provide reassuring handling in almost all situations. With a capable and refined 2.4-liter engine installed under the hood, the RAV4 has the power to complement its sharp reflexes. Inside, buyers will find a set of stylish white-faced gauges. As usual, all controls are simple and straightforward to use. Thoughtful design elements include adjustable cupholders and well-placed storage bins. There's plenty of room for four passengers, but throw in a fifth and things get a little tight. Behind the rear seat, the RAV4 can hold 29.2 cubic feet of cargo. Remove the 50/50-split bench seat, which also slides, tumbles, folds and reclines, and the vehicle can hold an impressive 68.3 cubic feet. The four-door RAV4 is offered in a single trim level and comes with front-wheel drive (2WD) or all-wheel drive (AWD). All RAV4s come with 16-inch wheels, ABS, stability control, air conditioning, a height-adjustable driver seat, cruise control, a six-speaker CD stereo and power windows, mirrors and locks. Upgrade to the \"L\" package and you'll also get heated mirrors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, dark tinted glass, foglights and body-color bumpers and door handles. The \"L\" package is also your ticket to leather upholstery and heated seats if you want them. A sport package adds a mesh grille, a hood scoop, color-keyed door handles, a roof rack, silver sport pedals, heated mirrors, gray-painted bumpers and overfenders and sport fabric seats. Other options include alloy wheels, a sunroof and keyless entry. Larger tires are also available on AWD models.",

    "full_description": "For 2016, every Tundra gets an upgraded electronics interface, while the upper trim levels get a larger gas tank and a standard integrated trailer brake control. The SR5 and 1794 Edition also gets slightly revised front end styling. The 1794 can also now be equipped with the TRD Off-Road package. The 2016 Toyota Tundra is a capable full-size pickup, and one of the few in this class that is very serious about off-road performance. Unfortunately, it lags behind its American rivals in many other respects. The full-size pickup truck is an unabashedly and proudly  American creation. Baseball, apple pie, pickup trucks, etc. So it is perhaps  understandable, then, that the 2016 Toyota Tundra finds itself at a  disadvantage compared to the full-size trucks from Ford, GM and Ram. But it's  actually not because the Tundra is from a Japanese company (though it's built  in Texas).\nAge has a lot to do with it. The Tundra underwent a thorough  update two years ago that brought revised styling, an improved cabin and updated  features, but it was largely akin to a kitchen remodel as compared to breaking out  the wrecking ball and fully rebuilding up from the foundation. The revisions  just weren't enough to fix flaws or make notable advances. In contrast, the  Ford F-150 now has a lightweight aluminum body and turbocharged engines, and the  Ram 1500 has a smooth-riding coil spring suspension and efficient turbodiesel  V6. The recently redesigned Chevrolet Silverado wasn't especially innovative,  but its incremental improvements in just about every vehicular facet have  allowed it to soundly keep up with the Joneses.\n\nFitted with the TRD Off-Road  package, the 2016 Toyota Tundra Limited is one of the more capable light-duty  trucks off road.\nThe Tundra does not. Its V8 engines definitely get the job done,  but they trail their competitors, especially in terms of fuel economy. There  also isn't a V6 option, nor a fuel-efficient alternative such as the  aforementioned Ford EcoBoost V6 or Ram EcoDiesel. Then there's  the driving experience. The Tundra feels more like a classic, stiff-riding  truck of the past while traversing broken pavement, with bumps big and small  easily being felt by all in the cabin. This is the result of a stiff rear  suspension admittedly up to the task of stout hauling duties, but if it's just  the family making its way across town, the jostling will get old.\nIn all fairness, the Tundra does indeed offer truck buyers  an awful lot to value. Its double cab is one of the more spacious extended cabs  on the market, while the CrewMax is legitimately sprawl-out comfortable, with  not only copious legroom but also the added comfort of a reclining seatback. Those  interested in venturing off road would also be wise to consider the capable TRD  Pro trim level.\nYet, for the most part, the Edmunds \"B\"-rated 2016 Toyota Tundra quite simply falls short of the current crop of top-notch  pickups: the \"A\"-rated Ram  1500 and Ford F-150, as  well as the Chevy  Silverado and GMC Sierra.  The 2016 Nissan Titan XD,  with its diesel-powered engine, also promises a degree of innovation the Tundra  lacks and may stand a better chance of countering the argument that only  American companies can build such a quintessentially American vehicle. The 2015 Toyota Tundra  is offered with a choice of two V8 engines. Rear-wheel drive is standard and  four-wheel drive with a two-speed transfer case is optional. A six-speed  automatic is always standard.\nFor SR double cab  models and all SR5 models, a 4.6-liter V8 comes standard, producing 310  horsepower and 327 pound feet of torque. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 16 mpg combined (15 city/19 highway) on 2WD  models; 4WD versions also rate 16 mpg combined (14/18). Maximum towing capacity  with the 4.6-liter engine is between 6,400 and 6,800 pounds depending on body  style.\nA 5.7-liter V8 is standard on the regular cab and all  variations of the Limited, Platinum, 1794 and TRD Pro. It is optional on SR5  trims. It produces 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque. EPA  fuel economy estimates are 15 mpg (13/18) with 2WD and 15 (13/17) with 4WD.  A tow package is standard on all Tundras  equipped with the 5.7-liter V8. Depending on body style, maximum towing  capacity is between 9,800 and 10,500 pounds.\nIn Edmunds testing, a  Tundra 1794 with four-wheel drive accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 6.8  seconds, while a Tundra TRD Pro did it in 6.7 seconds. These are both quick,  yet average times for the segment. Standard safety  equipment on the 2016 Toyota Tundra includes antilock brakes, stability and  traction control, trailer sway control, front knee airbags, front side-impact  airbags and side curtain airbags that cover both rows. A rearview camera is  standard across the board. A blind-spot warning system, rear cross-traffic  alert and parking sensors are optional on the SR5 and Limited, and standard on  the Platinum and 1794 Edition. \nIn government crash testing, the Tundra received four out of five stars  for overall and frontal crash protection, and five stars for side protection.  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Tundra Double Cab its top  rating of \"Good\" in the moderate front overlap, side and roof  strength tests. Its seat and head restraint design also received a  \"Good\" rating for whiplash protection in rear impacts.\nDuring an Edmunds  braking test, a Tundra 1794 with 4WD came to a stop from 60 mph in 130 feet,  which is about average for the segment. A 4WD TRD Pro took 134 feet, which isn't  much farther, even considering its all-terrain tires. We're fond of the 2016 Toyota Tundra's 5.7-liter V8. It isn't  a class leader when it comes to horsepower, but it remains a champ for towing  thanks to its prodigious torque and well-sorted six-speed automatic. The  optional TRD exhaust paired with the 5.7-liter engine makes for a nice rumble  on acceleration, too. Casual users probably will find the 4.6-liter V8's  performance adequate for most driving situations short of big-time towing, and  it provides better fuel economy -- although neither V8 is a class standout in  this department.\nThe Tundra's light steering makes parking lot maneuvers  easy, but it's not especially confidence-inspiring when operating at higher  speeds, and contributes to the Tundra feeling bigger and more unwieldy than  competing trucks (which are plenty big and unwieldy as it is). The Tundra's  main demerit, however, is its ride quality. In order to haul and tow as much as  possible without the need for special packages, axle ratios or separate  heavy-duty models, the Tundra's suspension has been stiffened to the point that  occupants feel every single bump and rut. The jostling and borderline harshness  only get worse with the optional 20-inch wheels, and in general, the Tundra  feels decidedly old-school at a time when its competitors (especially the Ram)  have improved dramatically in this area. The Tundra's cabin design is attractive and well built. Stepping  up to one of the upper trim levels brings the sort of fancier, elevated  ambience that's come to be expected from high-dollar trucks. Even the most  basic Tundra, though, comes with one of Toyota's user-friendly Entune touchscreen interfaces. The SR5  trim and higher get a larger screen and increased functionality, while there  are the usual array of available smartphone connectivity functions. In general,  and especially compared to its Ford and GM rivals, the Tundra features  user-friendly tech.\nThe front seats in every trim are broad and comfortable, but  it's in the backseat where the Tundra enjoys advantages over most. There is a  considerable amount of legroom even in the double cab, while the CrewMax boasts  a vast amount of stretch-out space and the unique ability to recline the seat.  The folding rear seats in double cabs and CrewMax models also provide a good  amount of protected storage for valuable items you'd rather not leave in the  bed.\n\nThe 2016 Toyota Tundra CrewMax's  backseat flips up and even reclines. \nDepending on which  configuration you choose, there are six trim levels for the Tundra: SR, SR5,  Limited, Platinum, 1794 Edition and TRD Pro. The availability of some options  or packages can vary based on the region in which you live.\nThe base SR (regular  and double cab only) comes standard with 18-inch steel wheels, full power  accessories, keyless entry, heated mirrors, a windshield wiper de-icer, a  damped tailgate, air-conditioning, cruise control, a rearview camera, 40/20/40  bench seat, cloth upholstery, a tilt-only steering wheel, Bluetooth phone and  audio connectivity, and a six-speaker sound system with a 6.1-inch touchscreen  interface, a CD player, an auxiliary audio jack, a USB port and a media player  interface. The SR Work Truck package removes the power locks and windows, and  replaces the cloth upholstery and carpet with vinyl.\nGoing with the SR5  (double cab and CrewMax only) gets you foglights, exterior chrome trim,  variable intermittent windshield wipers and an upgraded tech interface that  includes a 7-inch touchscreen, HD and satellite radios, traffic information and  a navigation app. The CrewMax adds a power opening rear window and an overhead  console. The SR5 Upgrade package adds front bucket seats that include a power  height-adjustable driver seat and lumbar adjustment, a center console (with  storage and \"floor\" shifter), a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel,  an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a larger gas tank when equipped with the  5.7-liter V8. To that package, the Safety & Convenience package adds front  and rear parking sensors, a blind-spot warning system and rear cross-traffic  alert. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels can be added as a stand-alone option.\nThe TRD Pro includes  the SR5 Upgrade items plus unique styling elements, black 18-inch alloy wheels,  off-road tires, an off-road suspension that includes Bilstein shock absorbers, four  movable bed tie-down cleats, an eight-way power driver seat, a four-way power  passenger seat, leather upholstery with TRD logo and red stitching, an upgraded  7-inch touchscreen (optional on SR5), a navigation system and additional  speakers (seven double cab, nine CrewMax).\nThe Limited (double  and CrewMax only) adds to the base and Upgrade SR5 equipment automatic  headlights, 20-inch alloy wheels, the tie-down cleats, automatic dual-zone climate  control, an eight-way power driver seat, a four-way power passenger seat,  leather upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a power-sliding  horizontal rear window (double cab), an upgraded 7-inch touchscreen, a  navigation system and additional speakers (seven double cab, nine CrewMax). The  Limited Premium package adds the Safety & Convenience items plus extra  interior lighting and anti-theft alarm features. A sunroof is optional on the  CrewMax.\nAt the top of the food  chain, the Platinum (CrewMax only) comes standard with the Safety &  Convenience items and builds on the Limited's equipment with LED running  lights, power-folding and auto-dimming mirrors, a sunroof, distinctive 20-inch  wheels and styling elements, heated and ventilated power front seats (10-way  driver, six-way passenger), driver memory functions and a 12-speaker JBL sound  system (optional on the Limited CrewMax).\nThe 1794 Edition  really only differs from the Platinum in terms of its distinctive exterior and  interior styling elements.\nThe TRD Off-Road  package can be added to the SR5, Limited and 1794 Edition. It includes 18-inch  TRD wheels, off-road tires, trail-tuned shock absorbers, skid plates and tow  hooks.\nStand-alone options on  most trim levels include heated tow mirrors and running boards.\n\nThe 2016 Toyota Tundra's cabin  is competitive in terms of its design and quality.",

    "full_description": "Car  shoppers have more choices than ever for a three-row midsize SUV. But don't  forget about one of the crossovers that started it all. The redesigned 2020  Toyota Highlander steps back into the mix with key changes that uphold its spot  as a solid pick in the class. \nThe  new Highlander is slightly longer than its predecessor, and that extra room  increases the cargo space behind the third-row seat. Last year's Highlander could only hold 13.8 cubic  feet of gear behind the third row \u2014 one of the smallest cargo holds  in the class. The extra room increases the 2020 Highlander's carrying capacity  to 16 cubes, which is more competitive though still far off from leaders in the  segment.\nOn  the inside, there's a standard 8-inch touchscreen or a new 12.3-inch display on  top-line Platinum trims. Perhaps even more important, both support Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto integration this year. In the previous Highlander, you  had to rely on Toyota's underwhelming Entune system to fully connect your  smartphone. \nOur  main concern is that the  2020 Toyota Highlander, while thoroughly competent, doesn't raise the bar in  any meaningful way. That leaves the door open for two newcomers, the Hyundai  Palisade and Kia Telluride, to potentially woo you over with their bigger  interiors and luxury-like designs. We'd  opt to save some cash and choose the LE.  After all, every Highlander now comes with a V6 engine, advanced safety  equipment, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. The LE also adds a  power liftgate, blind-spot monitoring, LED foglights, and a leather-trimmed  steering wheel and shift knob. That's a lot of value baked into an affordable  three-row SUV, as long as you don't mind cloth seats. How does the Highlander drive? Unlike some other SUVs that can be slow to respond when you first step on the accelerator, the Toyota Highlander delivers near immediate response. At our Edmunds test track we measured 0-60 mph at 7.5 seconds, which is slightly better than average and a dead heat with the top-rated Kia Telluride \u2014 though the Highlander feels a little quicker from the driver's seat. \n\n   The Highlander's ability to negotiate a twisty road has improved. Body roll is controlled as you go around turns, and the available torque-vectoring AWD system can also help by applying engine power to individual rear wheels to subtly enhance the SUV's handling balance (in addition to the usual benefit of extra traction in wet weather).\n\n   Despite all this advanced technology, the Highlander still feels like a bigger SUV. A number of competitors move with more purpose and lightness, and many are able to stop quicker in an emergency braking scenario. Ultimate performance aside, the Highlander makes daily driving a low-effort activity, which is most important. How comfortable is the Highlander? The Highlander's ride quality is pleasantly plush. Large and small road imperfections are smoothed over thanks to the compliant suspension, yet it avoids feeling floaty or disconnected at higher speeds. The front seats are quite comfortable even on long drives, and the available second-row captain's chairs deliver nearly the same amount of comfort. Alas, the third-row seats are one of the Highlander's greatest liabilities. Thin padding, a very low seat cushion and narrow space make them ill-suited for adults.\n\n   Wind noise is well silenced on the highway, though, and road noise is minimal. Our test Highlander did have a minor creak developing at the top of the driver's door. How\u2019s the interior? The first and second seating rows provide ample space, but the third row is one of the most confining in the midsize three-row SUV class. If you're planning on regularly using the full passenger capacity, you will be better served by rivals such as the Kia Telluride or Volkswagen Atlas. Once you're seated, it's easy to find your preferred driving position, but taller drivers may wish for a bit more extension range from the telescoping steering wheel (it can be a bit of a reach).\n\n   We give the Highlander high marks for outward visibility. The front roof pillars are thin, which help you see around turns. Some of the Highlander's available technology features help too, such as the camera-based rearview mirror that allows you to see out the back even if you've fully loaded up the rear cargo area. The available surround-view camera system is sharp and can be rotated to \"look around\" the vehicle. How\u2019s the tech? In recent years, Toyota has trailed other manufacturers when it comes to tech. This Highlander makes big strides in the right direction, but it still has some drawbacks. The optional 12.3-in touchscreen is huge (an 8-inch screen is standard) and it responds quickly to inputs, but the reflections on the surface make using it more difficult than it should be. Our Highlander Platinum test vehicle had five USB charge ports for the first and second rows but none for the third row.\n\n   Toyota provides a comprehensive suite of advanced driver aids as standard on all Highlanders. Among other things, we like the adaptive cruise control, but we found the lane departure warning slightly too sensitive in the normal mode and not sensitive enough in the low mode. How\u2019s the storage? Cargo space is a bit of a mixed bag with the Highlander. Behind the third row, there's only 16 cubic feet of space, which is small for the class. Behind the second row, it expands to a better-than-average 48.4 cubic feet. The liftover height is about average for a midsize SUV. \n\n   As for cabin storage, there are good-size pockets and cupholders, as well as two shelves built into the dash (one has a clever phone cable keeper too). Because the wireless phone charger is in the center armrest bin, you have to flip it up to access the space underneath, which some might find inconvenient.\n\n   Got kids? A large rear-facing car seat will easily be accommodated in the second row thanks to the generous amount of fore/aft movement of the available captain's chairs. The LATCH anchors are also easy to locate and access for all types of seats, though there are no anchors in the third row. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates the all-wheel-drive Highlander returns 23 mpg (20 city/27 highway) and a slightly better 24 mpg (21 city/29 highway) for front-wheel-drive models. This may not seem like a huge advantage over the competition with a difference of just 1 or 2 mpg, but it's significant for this class of vehicle.\n\n   On our 115-mile highway-heavy evaluation loop, we achieved 24.7 mpg, which indicates to us the EPA's estimates should be achievable. Of note, the Highlander Hybrid is estimated to return 36 mpg combined. Is the Highlander a good value? In general, the Highlander is a little more expensive than its closest rivals, and you don't quite get as many standard features. When it comes to quality, the interior materials are only about average when compared to what's used in the top-rated SUVs in this class.\n\n   Toyota's warranty coverage is pretty common for the class with three years/36,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage and five years/60,000 miles for the powertrain. Toyota provides the first two years of scheduled maintenance for free. The new styling up front gives the Highlander more of an industrial, truck-like appearance, which is pleasing. The same can't be said, though, for the Supra-inspired character line that goes from the bottom of the front door and over the rear wheels. \n\n   One thing that helps boost this score is the fact that the Highlander is composed on a twisting road. We might even say it's fun to drive for a midsize three-row SUV.",

    "full_description": "The 2013 Toyota Tacoma receives a new Limited package but otherwise carries over unchanged. With multiple configurations and ample ability on- and off-road, the 2013 Toyota Tacoma remains one of the top choices among midsize trucks. If you're looking for a truck that's not quite full-size but  not a compact pool cleaner's special either, the 2013 Toyota Tacoma could work  out well. As former owners of fuel-thirsty full-size trucks look to downsize  without sacrificing utility, the Tacoma not only calms the dread of filling the  tank, but also offers smaller dimensions that ease everyday tasks like  threading tight parking lots or crowded traffic lanes.\nThe Tacoma offers multiple body styles, engines,  drivetrains, suspensions and trim levels that broaden its appeal from no-frills  work truck to comfortable family hauler. What it lacks in full-size work truck  capabilities -- ask yourself how often you're going to tow 9,000 pounds -- the  Tacoma makes up for with rugged build quality, excellent reliability and modern  electronic conveniences like iPod connectivity, Bluetooth and Web-based app  integration through Toyota's Entune system.\nBuyers can outfit the Tacoma from the most basic single  bench seat regular cab to the new well-appointed Limited edition off-road V6  workhorse. For 2013, the Limited edition offers luxuries like premium  upholstery and heated front seats, perfect for those who need a midsize truck  in colder weather. Those who want a more hard-core off-road machine -- or at  least the look of one -- can opt for a Tacoma with the T/X package, while the  X-Runner fills the bill for those who simply want a sharp-looking city truck.\nThe 2013 Toyota Tacoma is a top pick in a rapidly dwindling  midsize segment. The cleverly designed 2013 Honda  Ridgeline is a good truck for daily light-duty use, but its  carlike frame lacks the sturdiness that most truck buyers want. Ford and GM  have temporarily left the segment, leaving only the Nissan  Frontier as the Tacoma's only  serious competition. The Frontier is equally muscular, but its interior isn't  as nice or refined. The 2013 Toyota Tacoma is available with a 2.7-liter  four-cylinder or 4.0-liter V6 engine, and a choice of rear-wheel or four-wheel  drive. Most models come standard with the four-cylinder producing 159  horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed manual transmission is  standard on Regular and Access Cab models, while the PreRunner Access and Double  Cabs get a four-speed automatic (also available as an option on the two other  body styles).\nA two-wheel-drive Tacoma with the four-cylinder and five-speed  manual returns an EPA-estimated 21 mpg city/25 mpg highway and 23 mpg combined.  Adding the automatic transmission drops those to 19/24/21. Four-wheel-drive  models yield 18 mpg city/21 mpg highway and 19 mpg combined regardless of  transmission.\nA 4.0-liter V6 comes standard with the 4x4 Double Cab and  X-Runner, and is optional on the Access Cab and PreRunner Double Cab. The V6  makes 236 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque and pairs with a standard six-speed manual  or optional five-speed automatic.\nA two-wheel-drive Tacoma with the V6 and automatic  transmission returns an EPA-estimated 17 mpg city/21 mpg highway and 19  combined. Four-wheel-drive models yield 16 mpg city/21 mpg highway and 18  combined. The manual numbers are slightly worse.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, a V6 Tacoma Double Cab covered  zero to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds -- suitably quick for a midsize truck. Properly  equipped, the Tacoma can tow 6,500 pounds. Standard safety equipment on the 2013 Toyota Tacoma includes  antilock brakes (front disc, rear drum) with brake assist, stability and  traction control, front-seat side-impact airbags, full-length side curtain  airbags and front active head restraints. Hill-start assist and downhill assist  are available on four-wheel-drive models equipped with the automatic transmission.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, a Tacoma Double Cab came to a stop  from 60 mph in a short 126 feet. \nIn government crash testing, the 2013 Toyota Tacoma Double  Cab received an overall rating of four stars (out of a possible five), with  three stars for frontal crashes and five stars for side impacts. The Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety gave the Tacoma its top rating of \"Good\"  in its frontal-offset and side crash tests, but a second-to-worst rating of \"Marginal\"  in the roof strength test. Buyers who don't plan to tow heavy loads, or those who just  want to save some money out the door, will find the 2.7-liter four-cylinder  perfectly acceptable. It isn't especially more fuel-efficient than the brawnier  V6, however, which is a better choice for work and play thanks to an abundance  of low-range pull.\nOn pavement, the 2013 Toyota Tacoma's ride quality and  handling are decent enough, although models fitted with firmer suspensions can  feel jittery pulling an empty bed. Off-road, the four-wheel-drive Tacoma is an  exceptional performer. Braking is the only area where the Tacoma comes up  merely average. Its stopping power is acceptable, but the soft pedal feel doesn't  inspire much confidence. The 2013 Toyota Tacoma interior isn't fancy and there's a  fair amount of hard plastic throughout, but the big cabin is still one of the  nicest in this workhouse utility segment. Front bucket seats offer good comfort  and support, though some may find them mounted too low to the floor. While the  Access Cab's rear jump seats are only fit for small children (and then only in  a pinch), the Double Cab's backseat is surprisingly adult-friendly, especially  compared to the squished confines of the Nissan Frontier.\nIn both cases, rear seats flip up or fold down to create  protected storage for items you'd rather not leave rolling around in the bed. Enhancing  the Tacoma's utility readiness, the bedliner's composite material makes dents  and dings a non-issue when hauling furniture, bikes or other materials with  hard or pointed edges. The available bed-mounted household-style 115-volt AC  outlet should also prove invaluable on camping trips and at tailgate parties. \nStandard features on Tacoma Regular Cab base models include  15-inch steel wheels, a limited-slip differential, air-conditioning, a  composite bedliner, a bed utility rail system, a cloth bench seat, a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming and a four-speaker sound  system with a 6.1-inch touchscreen display, CD player, USB/iPod port and an  auxiliary audio jack. Regular Cab 4x4 models add 16-inch wheels, black fenders,  an engine skid plate and front and rear mud guards. A sliding rear window is  optional on all Regular Cabs.\nThe base model Access Cab gains upgraded cloth upholstery,  front bucket seats, fold-up rear seats with under-seat storage, power locks and  windows, a center console and a six-speaker sound system. The entry-level  Tacoma Double Cab adds power mirrors, driver seat lumbar adjustment, a  60/40-split rear bench seat and rear seat vents.\nMost options are grouped into packages, which can vary by  region and drivetrain choices. The Convenience package adds a tinted sliding  rear window, keyless entry, cruise control and steering-wheel audio controls to  Access Cabs and Double Cabs (Access Cabs also get power mirrors). Several  variations of the SR5 package (available on all but Regular Cabs and X-Runner  Access Cab) combine items from the Convenience package with features like a  chrome grille and rear bumper, foglights, variable-speed wipers, upgraded cloth  upholstery, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, sport seats, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel and a rearview camera.\nThe new Limited package includes most of the Convenience and  SR5 features and adds 18-inch alloy wheels, upgraded upholstery, heated front  seats and a four-way-adjustable driver seat.\nRear-wheel-drive PreRunner versions adopt a rugged off-road  look without the increased traction, additional weight or reduced fuel economy  of the four-wheel-drive models. The rear-wheel-drive X-Runner adopts a more  street-oriented stance with a body kit, hood scoop, 18-inch alloy wheels,  lowered sport-tuned suspension and standard V6, plus foglights and an upgraded  sound system.\nThe TRD Off-Road and TRD Sport packages are only available  for 4x4 V6 Access and Double Cabs. The Off-Road package includes 16-inch alloy  wheels, fender flares, a heavy-duty suspension, a locking rear differential,  hill start assist and hill descent control on automatic transmission models,  skid plates, sport seats and most items from the SR5 and Convenience packages.  The street-oriented Sport package includes 17-inch alloy wheels, a hood scoop,  a sport suspension, hill start assist and hill descent control on automatic  transmission models, sport seats and most items from the SR5 and Convenience  packages.\nThe T/X and T/X Pro packages infuse V6 Access and short-bed Double  Cabs with an even more aggressive off-road look, adding unique black alloy  wheels, all-terrain tires, black tube steps and a stainless-steel exhaust tip.  The T/X Pro adds to those items a cat-back exhaust and special side graphics.\nDouble Cabs with V6 engines can also be ordered with an  upgraded seven-speaker audio and navigation system that includes HD radio,  satellite radio, voice recognition, a rearview camera and Toyota's Entune  smartphone integration.",

    "full_description": "The  2020 Toyota Corolla Hatchback offers a lot of virtues in a small package. For a  nameplate that doesn't normally evoke a whole lot of passion, the latest  Corolla Hatchback is surprisingly fun to drive. It's nimble and engaging around  turns and is decently powerful when you need it to be. On top of that, it's  comfortable on long drives and comes with plenty of the latest technology and  safety features.  \nOddly,  the main quality you'd expect the Corolla Hatchback to do well in \u2014  utility \u2014 is a bit of a letdown. It simply doesn't offer a lot of  cargo space behind the rear seats compared to rival models such as the Honda  Civic and the Kia Forte GT. Rear legroom is also lacking. Kids will be fine  back there, but taller adults will definitely feel cramped. \nThis  year's Corolla Hatchback thankfully receives Android Auto smartphone  integration. It joins the existing Apple CarPlay integration, so Toyota has  finally caught up in this regard. Overall, the 2020 Toyota Corolla Hatchback  isn't the most utilitarian choice in the class, but it has enough positives  that we think it's worth a closer look. Notably, the 2020 Toyota Corolla Hatchback is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article and we picked the 2020 Toyota Prius as one of Edmunds' Best Gas Mileage Cars for 2020. Our  favorite combination on the Corolla Hatchback is the XSE trim level with the CVT automatic. It's the most expensive  version of the Corolla Hatchback, but it comes with quite a bit of standard  equipment, including dual-zone automatic climate control, blind-spot  monitoring, and all the lower-level equipment such as Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto capability. If you're looking to pinch a few pennies, though, the standard  SE trim level is pretty feature-loaded as well. How does the Corolla Hatchback drive? It has a relatively small engine, but the Corolla Hatchback's power is adequate. Our manual-equipped test car covered 0-60 mph in 7.8 seconds, which is an average time for this type of car. The brakes are also adequately powerful for emergency stops and are easy to modulate for smooth stops in typical driving. \n\n   The steering doesn't give you much of a feel for the road, but it's quick to respond. Along with the car's balanced handling, the Corolla Hatchback makes a sporty initial impression. On a twisty road, this little hatchback is surprisingly fun and engaging. How comfortable is the Corolla Hatchback? The Corolla Hatchback strikes a great balance between comfort and composure. It might be a bit soft over freeway undulations, but the body stays well under control. Go with the SE trim and its smaller 16-inch wheels for maximum comfort. The XSE rides a bit rougher because of its bigger wheels and skinnier sidewall tires. \n\n   On the open road, you'll appreciate the fairly quiet interior. The front seats will also appeal to a wide variety of drivers and are relatively comfortable even over long journeys. Airflow from the climate control system is effective at both heating and cooling. How\u2019s the interior? The Corolla's climate control buttons are a bit crowded and the infotainment buttons are a bit small, but you can figure things out relatively quickly. There's ample access to the front seats thanks to a large door opening, and the seat height makes getting in and out a breeze. \n\n   Adjustments can be made quickly, and drivers of varying sizes will be able to get comfortable behind the tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel. The rear should be OK for most passengers, but taller passengers will desire more legroom. As you'd expect from a compact hatchback, there's great visibility in every direction. A low hoodline aids forward visibility, while plenty of side glass makes lane changes stress-free. How\u2019s the tech? The Corolla hatch comes standard with automated emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, auto high-beam control, and lane keeping assist \u2014 an impressive array for a car in this price range. The high-mounted 8-inch touchscreen is visually appealing, but various speed-related lockouts and a lack of a native navigation system make for a frustrating experience. The decent audio system helps, but other cars have much better.\n\n   The native voice recognition system is reasonably accurate as long as you follow the tutorial and set up the system to recognize your voice. Thankfully, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now included and are effective voice command work-arounds. How\u2019s the storage? A small, practical hatchback can be a surprisingly versatile car, but a high floor spoils the Corolla's cargo space. Behind the rear seats you get 17.8 cubic feet. Competitors such as the Kia Forte and the Hyundai Elantra GT offer more. \n\n   The door pockets and decent cupholders mean there's some room for small items. In front of the shift lever, there's a shelf that looks to be for a phone, but it's not really big enough to hold one. The center console bin is also a bit small and awkward to reach into. For family duty, the Corolla has a decent amount of space for rear-facing child safety seats. The car seat anchors are easily accessible. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Corolla Hatchback gets an EPA-estimated 31 mpg combined with the six-speed manual transmission or up to a rather impressive 35 mpg with the automatic. Our manual-equipped test car returned 30 mpg on our 115-mile evaluation route. Our total test fuel economy with random driving mixed in was a more lackluster 25.9 mpg, but we believe the EPA estimate should be achievable for most drivers. Is the Corolla Hatchback a good value? The Corolla Hatchback is well-built, offers good fuel economy, and comes with a lot of standard safety features. Overall warranty coverage is average, though you do get free scheduled maintenance for services such as oil changes and tire rotations for the first two years/25,000 miles. \"Surprising\" might be the best word to describe the Corolla Hatchback. Its styling and upscale interior push the Corolla name a little more upmarket. And its compliant ride, fun handling and willing engine make it genuinely fun. All that and an available manual transmission give it real potential as a fun-to-drive hatchback, even if it doesn't quite make it into hot-hatch territory.",

Certain models also get the Scout GPS Link app, which displays smartphone navigation on the central display. Roomy, comfortable and offered in several different trim levels, the Toyota Sienna minivan is an excellent choice for families.Notably, we picked the 2016 Toyota Sienna as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars, Trucks and SUVs. For sensible family transportation, you can't do much better  than the 2016 Toyota Sienna. One of the best minivans in the business, it offers  seating for eight and class-exclusive available all-wheel drive. Overall, the Sienna  effortlessly holds its own against its fellow top-rated minivans, the Honda Odyssey  and Kia Sedona.\n\nWith seating for eight  and available all-wheel drive, the 2016 Toyota Sienna is an ultra-practical  family hauler.\nThe Sienna was significantly refreshed last year, and we took  special notice of the heavily revised interior that featured more user-friendly  center stack controls. They're located closer to the driver than before, and the  climate controls are easier to understand and use. Toyota also substantially improved interior materials  quality, making the van seem like you're truly getting your money's worth.\nDelivering a comfortable ride has always been a Sienna high point,  and last year's structural and suspension improvements make it ride and handle even  better than before. And if you want a minivan that feels less like a minivan, the  SE version boasts sharper steering and a more controlled suspension. It's definitely  not sporty, but it's one of the best of its kind to drive. We also appreciate that  unlike in the past, the SE is available with most of the creature comforts found  on other Sienna trims. As such, it's the one we'd most recommend.\nAs agreeable as the 2016 Toyota Sienna is, however, it's wise  to check out the handful of other choices. The 2016 Honda Odyssey is the most direct rival, with similar pricing and a few exclusive features of its  own. Top value can be found with the 2016 Kia Sedona,  which gives up little (if anything) to the Honda and Toyota, while costing less.  All of the above also offer seating for eight passengers. If you can make do with  seven seats, consider the funky and efficient 2016 Nissan Quest,  but we would steer clear of the aging 2016  Chrysler Town & Country and its Dodge Grand  Caravan sibling. Every 2016 Toyota Sienna comes with a 3.5-liter V6 engine that  delivers 266 horsepower and 245 pound-feet of torque and drives the front wheels  through a six-speed automatic transmission. The Sienna LE, XLE and Limited models  can also be equipped with all-wheel drive.\nIn Edmunds instrumented testing, a front-drive Sienna LE went  from zero to 60 mph in a swift 7.5 seconds. The EPA fuel economy  estimates come in at 21 mpg combined (18  city/25 highway) for front-wheel-drive versions. Opting for all-wheel drive drops  those estimates to 19  mpg combined (16/23). Antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front-seat  side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, a driver-side knee airbag, a front  passenger seat cushion airbag, active front head restraints and a rearview camera  are standard on all 2016 Toyota Sienna models.\nA blind-spot monitor, rear cross-traffic alert and front and  rear parking sensors are available depending on the trim level. The Limited can  be had with a forward collision warning system.\nAt our test track, a Sienna Limited stopped from 60 mph in 126  feet, which is about average for the minivan segment.\nIn government crash tests, the 2016 Toyota Sienna received a five-star rating for overall performance, with four stars  for total frontal crash protection and five stars for total side crash protection.  In tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Sienna earned a top  score of \"Good\" for its performance in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset,  side-impact, roof-strength tests and head restraint (whiplash protection) design.  It received the second highest rating of \"Acceptable\" in the IIHS test  for small-overlap frontal-crash protection. We've long been impressed by the Sienna's V6 engine and how it  delivers lively acceleration whether you're bopping around town running errands  or getting up to cruising speed on the freeway. The six-speed automatic transmission  does a great job of keeping the engine's thrust on tap, yet the Sienna still manages  to provide respectable fuel economy, provided you're not too aggressive with the  gas pedal.\n\nThe 2016 Sienna boasts  one of the more robust V6 engines in its class.\nAll versions offer competent handling, and the Sienna's plush  ride quality is more controlled than in past, floaty versions. Still, the SE's firmer  suspension (a relative term) provides more confidence around turns and greater body  control over big bumps and undulations without giving up an appreciable amount of  comfort. Its marginally heavier steering is also more natural than the slightly  numb calibration on other trims. If you're used to driving a car, the SE should  make the switch to a minivan a bit easier. Lower trim levels of the Sienna are attractively decked out with  high-quality fabric upholstery, while higher-end models get leather along with simulated  wood cabin accents. Materials quality is very good, and the dash design is modern  and attractive. Seating is plush, and there's abundant storage space along with  user-friendly controls.\n\nThe 2016 Toyota Sienna  has a fairly stylish dashboard by minivan standards.\nOn the electronics front, every Sienna comes with a touchscreen  interface. Both available screens feature a similar easy-to-decipher menu structure  with surrounding buttons that require little effort to jump from one main function  to another. These include utilizing the built-in navigation system or a suite of  smartphone-connected services, including Scout GPS Link. There's also the available  rear-seat entertainment system, which features a split-screen monitor that allows  two different media (a movie on one side and a video game on the other, for example)  to play simultaneously, thereby making it easier to quash at least one potential  sibling argument.\nThe eight-passenger Sienna comes with a 40/20/40-split second-row  bench, and its center section slides close to the front seats for easier access  to the little one seated there. It can also be removed and stowed within the van  itself (unlike the Odyssey's, where you must find a place for it elsewhere).\nWith a seven-passenger Sienna, you get specialized second-row  captain's chairs. Although their available extendable footrests will likely  catch your eye during a test-drive, you'll also likely be impressed by their ability  to slide much farther fore or aft than most competitors can manage, increasing sprawl-out  comfort or cargo space. Maximum cargo space stands at 150 cubic feet, though to  achieve this you have to remove the second-row seats, which are quite heavy and  awkward to remove. \nThe Sienna L includes 17-inch alloy wheels, a windshield wiper  de-icer, manual sliding rear doors, automatic headlights, cruise control, tri-zone  automatic climate control, a height-adjustable driver seat, cloth upholstery, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a rearview camera, Bluetooth phone and audio  connectivity, Siri Eyes  Free functionality for iPhone users and a four-speaker sound system with a 6.1-inch touchscreen, CD  player, a USB port, a media player interface  and an auxiliary audio jack.\n\nEven the base 2016 Toyota  Sienna L model comes standard with a touchscreen interface and automatic  climate control.\nThe LE adds roof rails, power-sliding side doors, privacy glass, heated mirrors, body-color  exterior trim (replacing black plastic), floor- and overhead-mounted consoles, a  conversation mirror, an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar support),  upgraded \"easy-clean\" fabric upholstery, second- and third-row sunshades,  a 7-inch touchscreen, compatibility with the Scout GPS Link app, and a six-speaker sound system with HD and satellite radios. All-wheel-drive  versions get 18-inch wheels.\nThe SE is equipped similarly to the LE but adds a sport-tuned  suspension, sharper steering, 19-inch alloy wheels, a unique front fascia (foglights,  LED daytime running lights and mesh grille) and lower-body skirting. The SE also  has a power liftgate, first- and second-row  perforated leather upholstery (row three gets leatherette premium vinyl), heated  front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and unique gauges with a larger driver  information screen.\nThe SE Premium adds a sunroof, keyless ignition and entry, blind-spot  and rear-cross-traffic warning systems, a navigation system, Entune smartphone app integration, a rear-seat  entertainment system (with HDMI and SD card inputs, a Blu-ray/DVD player, two 120-volt  power outlets and a large screen that can be split to display two different sources)  and the Driver Easy Speak system, which amplifies the driver's voice through the  rear speakers. A sunroof can be added separately.\nThe Sienna XLE shares many of the SE trim's comfort and convenience  equipment, but features similar suspension, steering and styling to the LE. It also adds a four-way power front passenger  seat, faux-wood trim, power-opening rear quarter windows and keyless ignition and  entry. The XLE Premium adds the SE Premium's features and rear parking sensors.  The XLE Navigation package includes the same items minus the rear entertainment  and blind-spot/cross-traffic warning systems.\nThe plush Limited includes the XLE Premium's features (minus  the rear-seat entertainment system) along with 18-inch alloy wheels, a different  grille, LED daytime running lights, auto-dimming and power-folding mirrors, front  and rear sunroofs, front and rear parking sensors, first- and second-row premium leather upholstery, driver memory settings,  a heated steering wheel, Toyota Safety Connect Emergency services, a navigation  system and an upgraded 10-speaker JBL surround-sound audio system. FWD powertrains  also get a sliding center console between the first two rows, extendable footrests  for the second row and a power-folding third row with upgraded leatherette upholstery.\nTo all that, the Limited Premium adds xenon headlights, automatic  high beams, automatic wipers, the rear-seat entertainment system and upgraded leatherette  for the third row (AWD only).\nFor the front-wheel-drive Sienna Limited only, an Advanced Technology  package adds adaptive cruise control and a forward collision warning system.",

    "full_description": "The  Toyota RAV4 is one of the best-selling passenger vehicles today. It's easy to  understand why: This small SUV has a smooth ride, plenty of space for  passengers and cargo, and many standard advanced driver safety features. No  doubt the RAV4's long-running status \u2014 it debuted all the way back in  1996 as one of the first crossover SUVs \u2014 and Toyota's name  recognition help too. \nBut  this popularity doesn't necessarily mean it's the best. In fact, we rank a few  other small SUVs ahead of the RAV4, including the equally popular Honda CR-V  and the upscale Mazda CX-5. If you want a RAV4, we're more inclined to recommend  the RAV4 Hybrid or the new RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid. They are more powerful  and easily justify their higher initial cost. Check out our Expert Rating for  our in-depth take on the 2021 RAV4.  The  RAV4 in midrange XLE Premium trim  gets our recommendation. It has enough features and interior upgrades to make  it look and feel nicer than supporting models, and delivers it all at a  sensible price. How does the RAV4 drive? The RAV4 doesn't impress here, unfortunately. The engine is willing around town, and passing and merging are drama-free. But if you're in a huge rush, you might notice the engine's ultimately modest power delivery. In Edmunds testing, our RAV4 Adventure test vehicle needed 9.1 seconds to cover 0-60 mph, which is slightly slower than the class average.\n\n   Another gripe we have is with the steering, which is vague at the center point and doesn't have appropriate levels of feel and heft. As such, it's easy to misjudge your level of input. In better news, the RAV4's optional upgraded all-wheel-drive system includes rear-axle torque vectoring and more advanced traction control systems with selectable terrain settings and hill descent control. These systems, plus respectable ground clearance, give the RAV4 Adventure above-average off-road ability for a small SUV. How comfortable is the RAV4? The RAV4's suspension is tuned to strike a good balance between control and softness. The body doesn't bound or float when you drive over bumps, and small to moderate impacts are absorbed without much drama. As for the front seats, they are nicely sculpted and padded appropriately, but the seat bottoms begin to feel flat on longer drives. The passenger side's lack of adjustment can also make it difficult to find a comfortable position.\n\n   At highway speeds, the RAV4 is generally quiet. The exception is when you hit the gas for a burst of speed, at which point the engine sound gets rather coarse. We do like the climate system's performance. Air distribution is ideal, with forward vents that can be closed off completely and vents for the rear seat. How\u2019s the interior? The driving position, roominess, and ease of entry and exit are all good. But the RAV4 would score higher if the front passenger seat wasn't set so high or could be adjusted down. The driver's seat and steering wheel have a good range of adjustment, but tall drivers might want a smidge more of each. Outward visibility is praiseworthy.\n\n   The control layout is intuitive with large, easy-to-read labeling. The audio system and climate system controls are islands unto themselves, and everything else is right where you expect it to be. The big rubberized climate control knobs are nice too. Our only gripe is that the touchscreen is too far away from the driver. The tuning knob, in particular, requires a reach to twist. How\u2019s the tech? The RAV4's interface has a mix of touchscreen and fixed buttons that are easy to learn without consulting the owner's manual. But even though the RAV4 is relatively new, the touchscreen's graphics look dated. The sound system works well enough, but it's nothing special. You do get standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. It's a good thing too since Toyota's native Entune software remains clunky.\n\n   The standard suite of driver aids is impressive. It includes adaptive cruise control that works down to 0 mph, automatic emergency braking, drowsy driver detection, automatic high beams, lane keeping assist and something called Line Tracing Assist, which is an active (but not hands-free) steering aid. How\u2019s the storage? The RAV4's cargo hold is nearly the biggest in its class. You get 37.5 cubic feet with the rear seats up and 69.8 cubic feet with them stowed. The RAV4 is also easy to load thanks to a low cargo floor. Up front, the cabin has numerous shelves and bins to handle assorted road-trip paraphernalia. If you're planning on towing, certain versions of the RAV4 can pull up to 3,500 pounds, which is above average for a small SUV.\n\n   Parents with young kids will appreciate the RAV4. It's easy to locate and connect safety seats to the lower car seat anchors. Likewise, tethering to the three upper anchors is straightforward. Forward-facing seats and boosters fit readily, but installing a rear-facing infant seat on the passenger side will likely require scooting the front seat up. The too-high front passenger seat is the issue. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates the RAV4 will get 27-30 mpg in combined city/highway driving, depending on the powertrain and trim level. We drove an AWD Adventure carrying three people, equipment and luggage for more than 7,000 miles. And over a variety of road and weather conditions, we averaged 28.6 mpg. Our best tank was 32.3 mpg and the worst was 25.6 mpg. Is the RAV4 a good value? The RAV4 is well built inside, with nice layered materials and seams that are invisible because they're built into the styling. It has tactile touches such as rubberized grip surfaces on the interior door pulls and the radio and climate knobs. The RAV4's optional simulated leather upholstery feels soft and pliable, and the stitching is tidy. Toyota's warranty coverage is average, but you do get a generous two years/25,000 miles of free scheduled maintenance. Driving a RAV4 isn't a chore, but it's not particularly memorable either. It's at its best when you go with the Adventure or TRD Off-Road trim level. The advanced torque vectoring all-wheel-drive system, capable traction control system with multiple terrain settings, and styling that's a little more rugged help the RAV4 stand out a little more.",

    "full_description": "New for 2006, the hybrid version of the Highlander pairs a gasoline-powered V6 with electric motors to improve fuel economy and acceleration. The 2006 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is an excellent family SUV that accommodates the needs of most SUV buyers while delivering the benefits of hybrid technology. Hybrids are certainly not new -- the first Honda Insights and Toyota Priuses rolled into dealerships over five years ago. But the 2006 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is the one that will put the term \"hybrid\" on the lips of average Americans. As revolutionary as cars like the Insight were, many people need more than two or even five seats. And that's where the Highlander comes in. As the first seven-passenger hybrid vehicle Toyota's alternative-powered SUV is revolutionary in its own quiet kind of way. Automakers have finally figured out that the key to mass hybrid sales is not necessarily stellar fuel economy. Given the price premium paid for most hybrids, vehicles like the Lexus RX 400h and Honda Accord Hybrid offer more luxury features and extra power. And the Toyota Highlander is no different. The \"conserving resources\" aspect of the Highlander Hybrid intentionally plays second banana to more important features like extra power and standard third-row seating. Does the Toyota Highlander Hybrid get better fuel economy than your average V6-powered SUV? Sure, it's rated 31 mpg/27 mpg highway. But it's the added snap of 268 hp that really get this Highlander recognized. The gas-electric Highlander also offers a few extra touches such as standard LED taillights and unique 17-inch wheels. Foglights, a rear roof spoiler and a JBL stereo are options. The Limited version is even more luxurious, as it's loaded up with every possible feature save for an optional DVD-based navigation system. But with that touchscreen nav system, you'll also have the added entertainment of a power flow chart and fuel economy meter like that found in the Prius.Front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive versions are available, though the Toyota Highlander Hybrid is intended for pavement duty. Toyota calls the all-wheel-drive system 4WD-i. It is an on-demand system that improves traction on wet and dry pavement and is capable of regenerating power from all four wheels. The system is unique in that it uses a rear-mounted motor/generator to power the rear wheels when wheel slip is detected in the front. The 2006 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is remarkable in that it doesn't force you to make uncomfortable compromises to stand up for the planet. Thanks, in part, to its conservative styling and simple, comfortable interior, this hybrid should make the move into the high-tech age painless for the typical family car buyer. To make the hybrid version, Toyota started with the 3.3-liter V6 in the standard Highlander, recalibrated it for duty in a hybrid and installed two electric motors. One of the motors is responsible for starting the gas engine and recharging the 288-volt battery pack. The other teams up with the V6 to drive the front wheels via a continuously variable transmission. All-wheel-drive models get a third motor that can juice the rear wheels when extra power or traction is needed; Toyota calls this setup 4WD-i. The gas-electric power plant makes a combined 268 horsepower. Fuel economy is 33 mpg city/28 mpg highway on front-drive (2WD) models and 31/27 on all-wheel-drive models. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds. Front-seat side airbags and first- and second-row head curtain airbags are standard on all Toyota Highlander Hybrid models. Also standard are four-wheel antilock disc brakes, ABS with BrakeAssist and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution, traction control, stability control. These safety systems are part of Toyota's new integrated safety system that coordinates all the vehicle's safety features to assure maximum accident avoidance capability and protection should an accident occur. The standard Toyota Highlander has a light and somewhat \"tossable\" nature but the added weight of the hybrid version gives it a more cumbersome feel around tight turns. It's still easy to maneuver in the city, though, and as smooth as they come on the highway. Acceleration is excellent at any speed, thanks to the electric motor assist. The interior of the Toyota Highlander Hybrid is essentially identical to that of the gasoline-only version. A thoughtful cabin design puts all the controls and storage areas within easy reach. Comfortable seating in the first and second rows and a total of 10 cupholders make the Highlander Hybrid a natural for family transportation. The second-row seat's lack of a flip-and-fold mechanism makes the third row tougher to access than most, but this is still the only hybrid that seats seven. The Toyota Highlander Hybrid is offered in base and Limited trim levels. The base model is nicely equipped with seven-passenger seating, cloth upholstery, a power driver seat, ABS, stability control, a six-speaker CD stereo and 17-inch alloy wheels. The lone option package for the base model includes a sunroof, an upgraded JBL stereo with a CD changer and foglights. The Limited comes with all of the above, as well as leather upholstery, wood grain interior trim, automatic climate control and a power front-passenger seat. A navigation system is the only option on the Limited.",

This  latest fifth-generation model makes all of the expected improvements over its  predecessor with more features, stronger performance, added refinement and more  efficient engines. An effort has also been made to give the  Avalon a more sporty and up-to-date character than before. The exterior styling  is sharper and the car's handling is more precise. Toyota has also equipped it  with its latest infotainment system that includes Apple CarPlay smartphone  integration. Of course, interior room and comfort are still key qualities for  the Avalon, and this newest model certainly delivers.Sales of big sedans have been dropping  for a while now as more car shoppers gravitate toward SUVs. But if you're one  of the sedan holdouts, you'll no doubt find the new 2019 Avalon to be one of  the best in its class. For more details about the 2019 Toyota  Avalon, read our Avalon First Drive article. The redesigned 2019 Toyota Avalon bridges the gap between the Camry and its pricier Lexus sibling, the ES 350. This latest fifth-generation model makes all of the expected improvements over its predecessor with more features, stronger performance, added refinement and more efficient engines. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the 2019 Toyota Avalon Touring (3.5L  V6 | 8-speed automatic | FWD). With a potent 301-horsepower V6 mated to a  smooth-shifting transmission, the 2019 Avalon has good power to get up and go.  It is also pleasant to use in most scenarios, from long road trips and  afternoon cruises to day-to-day commutes and short errands around town. Braking  is consistent and never grabby, which lends to its comfort in daily use. The  surprising thing about the Avalon is its athleticism \u2014 its shockingly  enjoyable handling and drivability. While not a sport sedan, this cruiser can  handle twisty roads with relative ease for a vehicle of its size. Think about a  mobile defensive end or tackle in football as opposed to an athletic  linebacker. Comfort is a strength for the Avalon and is  probably the primary reason you'd consider such a large sedan. All seating  positions give you ample cushioning and support for long drives or short  cruises. The leather in our Touring trim is very soft and gives the sensation  that it is more upscale than it is. The ride is cushioned and makes you feel  like you're shielded from the harsh roads of the outside world. The cabin feels  really cozy due to the climate control's quick heating and cooling  characteristics. While there is no rattling or shaking inside the cabin, road  noise is somewhat present at all times.  The Avalon Touring's cabin is a decent place to  be. It is roomy and user-friendly. There are even redundant key functions  located on the steering wheel. Legroom is abundant, the driving position is  superb due to its multitude and depth of adjustments, and visibility is great  up front and modest to the sides and over the shoulder. As far as controls go,  two minor issues: The radio tuning knob can be a reach for some and a couple of  functions, such as turning on the camera view, are tucked away. While legroom  is a strength, headroom can feel a little compromised for taller people  \u2014 especially in the rear due to the sloping roofline. Lastly, the  low-resolution rearview camera and display could use an upgrade. While cargo capacity is average on paper, it feels  more convenient compared to some others due to its wide trunk opening, broad  floor and convenient loading height. You might be disappointed if you're the  type who folds the rear seats to expand the space because there's a sizable  step up to the folded seats.\nInside,  there are numerous small cubbies, plenty of cupholders, and a center console  that's sizable and surprisingly deep. The door pockets are average, but there  are enough other options that it's not a concern. The Avalon really shines when  it comes to fitting child safety seats. The Isofix-style car seat anchors are  easy to access, and the huge rear bench has space enough for just about any  type of seat. Toyota's Entune 3.0 system and its new  9-inch touchscreen are surprisingly good. Apple CarPlay support makes things so  much better, but Android Auto is still absent. The display is bright and  responds well to inputs, but Toyota tends to lock out more functions while  you're driving than other carmakers. \nThere's  one USB port for data and four 2.1-amp power-only USBs \u2014 two up front  and two in back. The front console also houses a wireless charging pad. The  car's built-in voice controls are hit or miss \u2014 it's better at  understanding radio commands than navigation commands. We had much more success  using Siri via Apple CarPlay.\nAll  Avalons come standard with a comprehensive suite of active driver safety aids  that covers just about everything. The optional Advanced Safety package adds a  360-degree camera, parking clearance sensors and rear cross-traffic braking  intervention. In all likelihood, the 2019 Toyota  Avalon in Limited trim will hit the  sweet spot for the typical large sedan buyer. It straddles the line between  Toyota and Lexus without the sporty features and touches of the higher-trim  models. It's also eligible for rear parking sensors with cross-traffic braking  and the surround-view camera that is only offered on the top Touring trim. The XLE trim starts off generously with  17-inch alloy wheels, automatic LED headlights, heated mirrors, keyless entry  and ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable front seats  with heating, simulated leather upholstery, 60/40-split folding rear seats and  an auto-dimming rearview mirror.Technology  features include Bluetooth, a Wi-Fi hotspot, Toyota's Safety Connect emergency  communications, a 9-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, Toyota's Entune  infotainment system with smartphone-based navigation, Apple CarPlay, four USB  ports, and an eight-speaker audio system with satellite and HD radio. Also  included is Toyota's Safety Sense suite of advanced safety features \u2014  including forward collision warning with automatic braking, lane keeping  assist, automatic high beams and adaptive cruise control \u2014 as well as  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.Stepping  up to the Limited trim adds 18-inch  wheels, upgraded exterior lighting, a sunroof, a head-up display, leather  upholstery, ventilated front seats, driver-seat memory settings, heated rear  seats, a heated steering wheel, wood interior trim, aluminum pedal covers,  ambient interior lighting, a wireless charging pad, a built-in navigation  system and a 14-speaker premium JBL audio system.The  sporty XSE trim builds on the XLE's  features with 19-inch wheels, piano black exterior treatments, a sunroof, a  rear spoiler, augmented engine intake noises, paddle shifters, aluminum  interior trim and microsuede seat inserts. The  range-topping Touring trim comes  complete with all of the Limited and XSE upgrades, as well as an adaptive  suspension, an additional Sport-plus drive mode, a sport exhaust, augmented  engine noises and active noise cancellation. Some  of the features on the upper trims are available on the other trims as options.  An Advanced Safety package with a surround-view parking camera system and rear  parking sensors with automatic braking is optional on the Limited and the  Touring.",

    "full_description": "The 2012 Toyota Prius gets slightly different styling cues along with additional standard infotainment features and the availability of power front seats and Toyota's Entune suite of smartphone and Internet integration features. A new Plus Performance accessory package lends the Prius sharper handling and a sportier, more aerodynamic exterior. With a bevy of new high-tech features for 2012, the Toyota Prius enhances its appeal and status as the quintessential hybrid. The 2012 Toyota Prius is to hybrids what Kleenex is to  tissues. Other brands may offer something similar, but the Prius is what people  think of when they think hybrid. But is this perception still warranted now  that more competitors seem to pop up every year?\nTo keep things fresh for 2012, the current, third-generation  Prius receives its first minor refresh. The subtle styling tweaks are barely  discernible, while its other updates are more substantial. Even the base model  Prius Two (the Prius One is for fleet sales only) now comes with Bluetooth  phone and audio connectivity, dedicated iPod control and a touchscreen  electronics interface. All trims but the Two get Toyota's new Entune system,  which bundles satellite radio-sourced real-time information with a suite of  apps that connect the Prius to the Internet via your smartphone. It's now  possible to wirelessly stream Pandora or iHeart Radio through the car's sound  system.\nBeyond this increase of electronic toys, the 2012 Toyota Prius  maintains the practical advantages that have made it so successful. With an EPA  combined rating of 50 mpg, the Prius is topped only by the new Prius C  subcompact, or more expensive plug-in models like the 2012 Chevrolet Volt and  upcoming plug-in Prius. The Prius also stands out from the crowd because of the  generous dimensions of its backseat and the versatility of the hatchback-style  cargo area. In fact, the Prius is so practical that it's used as a taxi in many  cities.\nThere are downsides, however. Interior quality leaves much  to be desired, with more hard, unpleasantly grained plastics than other brands  offer. While the Prius is easy and intuitive to drive, there's zero enjoyment  behind the wheel. Other hybrids (including the new Prius C) are better in this  regard, while the more composed ride quality and quieter cabins of the 2012 Ford Fusion  Hybrid and 2012 Toyota  Camry Hybrid represent a much greater degree of refinement.\nAnother aspect to consider is price. Regular compact cars (either  gasoline- or diesel-powered) get excellent fuel economy nowadays while costing  much less, meaning the Prius might not produce the savings in fuel costs that you  think it will. Still, the 2012 Toyota Prius continues to warrant its position  as the quintessential hybrid. Its blend of fuel efficiency, practicality and  now technology make it an easy choice among hybrids. The 2012 Toyota Prius is powered by a 1.8-liter  four-cylinder engine combined with a pair of electric motor/generators.  Together they send a total output of 134 horsepower through a specialized  continuously variable transmission (CVT).\nIn track testing, we clocked the Prius from zero to 60 mph  in 10.1 seconds, which is about average for a hybrid vehicle. The EPA estimates  the 2012 Prius will return a very impressive 51 mpg city/48 highway and 50 mpg  combined. In real-world testing, we found these estimates to be reasonably  accurate. Every 2012 Toyota Prius comes standard with antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front side airbags, side curtain airbags and a driver knee airbag. The Prius Four and Five can be equipped with Toyota's Safety Connect emergency communications system. The Prius Five includes a pre-collision warning system and a lane-departure warning system.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Prius came to a stop from 60 in 118 feet \u2014 very good for a compact or midsize car.\nIn government crash tests, the Prius received a perfect five stars for overall protection, four stars for overall frontal protection and five stars for overall side protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Prius the highest possible rating of \"Good\" in its frontal-offset, side and roof strength tests. Acceleration in the 2012 Toyota Prius is far from sprightly,  but it's on par for similarly priced hybrids and certainly adequate. Four  driving modes -- Normal, Eco, Power and EV -- allow the pilot to decide the  optimum powertrain configuration depending on conditions. Eco is measured and  sluggish, but returns the best fuel economy. Power is useful for entering  freeways or driving on hills. EV mode locks out the gasoline engine, but only  up to 25 mph with at least a half-charged battery pack.\nAround town, the Prius is an easy-to-drive runabout. The  electric steering doesn't provide much feedback, but it's very light in parking  lots and doesn't become overly boosted on the highway. The ride is comfortable,  but nastier bumps can leave it a bit flummoxed. There is also an excessive  amount of road noise that permeates the cabin regardless of speed, and the  noises emitted by its smaller gasoline engine are hardly what we'd describe as  serene. The 2012 Prius features straightforward controls that jut  out toward the driver in a \"floating console\" that provides a storage  tray underneath. It's a nice design that helps maximize cabin space. The  now-standard touchscreen operates an increased number of high-tech features for  2012 and for the most part is smartly designed. The digital instrument panel  also features a floating layer that displays audio, temperature and trip computer  information when the driver touches those controls on the steering wheel,  minimizing eye movement. Some drivers might find the overall design a bit too  busy-looking, however.\nMaterials quality in the Prius is disappointing, with harder  and cheaper plastics than other cars in its price range. The corduroy-like  texturing on the climate and audio controls seems nice at first, but collects  oil from the skin and causes circular dark spots on most buttons.\nIn terms of versatility, though, the Prius is still a champ.  The hatchback body style provides more cargo capacity than a typical midsize  sedan, and the backseat offers plenty of space. Sadly, taller drivers still  have to contend with a steering wheel that's placed too far away. There's a  telescoping column, but it doesn't come out nearly far enough. On the upside,  the Prius finally offers power front seats. \nStandard equipment on the Prius Two includes 15-inch alloy  wheels, heated power mirrors, a rear window wiper, keyless ignition/entry,  cruise control, automatic climate control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, a height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split-folding rear seat, an  advanced trip computer, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a touchscreen  electronics interface and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, an  auxiliary audio jack and an iPod/USB audio interface.\nThe Prius Three gains an enhanced keyless entry system, a  rearview camera, a navigation system, voice controls, satellite radio, HD radio  and Toyota's Entune system, which includes real-time information (traffic,  weather, fuel prices, sports scores) and a suite of apps that connect the car  to Internet sites like Pandora, iHeart Radio and Open Table through your  smartphone. The Solar Roof package adds a sunroof and a solar-powered  ventilation system that keeps the car cool to limit the burden on the  air-conditioning system.\nThe Prius Four has automatic headlights, an eight-way power  driver seat, heated front seats, SofTex synthetic leather upholstery, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a JBL sound system with eight GreenEdge  speakers. The Deluxe Solar Roof package adds everything from the Prius Three  version plus a head-up display, Safety Connect emergency communications and an  upgraded navigation system with a high-definition display and split-screen  capability.\nThe Prius Five gets 17-inch alloy wheels, foglamps and LED  headlamps with auto level control and washers. The Advanced Technology package  adds adaptive cruise control, a pre-collision alert system, a lane-departure  warning system, Safety Connect, a head-up display and the higher-quality  navigation display.\nAvailable on all trims, the Plus Appearance package adds  unique 17-inch alloy wheels and a seven-piece aerodynamic body kit. To this the  Plus Performance package adds a sport-tuned suspension and unique badging.",

    "full_description": "The 2009 Toyota Camry Hybrid sees no major changes. The 2009 Toyota Camry Hybrid's compelling duo of superior fuel economy and comfortable family sedan attributes makes it a top choice for a hybrid vehicle. Typically, it will take seven to 10 years to recoup the price premium associated with hybrid cars. Federal tax credits can take a big chunk out of that premium, but as manufacturers like Toyota sell more hybrids, those credits disappear. Luckily for prospective buyers of the 2009 Toyota Camry Hybrid, the price difference between the Camry Hybrid and a similarly equipped Camry XLE four-cylinder is negligible. In other words, save gas, save money.Besides a price drop last year, not much has changed for the Camry Hybrid sedan since it was introduced for 2007. Utilizing the same fuel-sipping technology featured in Toyota's revolutionary Prius, this Camry provides the best fuel economy available in a traditional midsize sedan package, with an EPA combined estimate of 34 mpg. Plus, with its four-cylinder gasoline engine and electric motor combined, the resulting 187 horsepower provides acceleration quicker than most gas-only four-cylinder competitor sedans. In other words, save gas and go faster.Beyond its powertrain and the eerie quiet that goes with its electric operation, the hybrid is virtually indistinguishable from a regular Camry. As such, expect a spacious cabin, a sizable features list and a driving experience that isolates you from the surrounding world. If you should prefer a more involving driving experience, though, the Camry Hybrid probably isn't for you, as its ride is soft and its steering light.As a hybrid sedan alternative, there's the Nissan Altima Hybrid. It shares Toyota's hybrid technology but provides more feedback to the driver and is better to drive. It also provides a higher-quality interior and sportier styling for virtually the same price as the Camry. Unfortunately, it's only available in California-emissions states. On the opposite end of the driving excitement spectrum, Toyota's dull-but-frugal Prius offers similar passenger room, greater trunk space and better gas mileage for less money than the Camry.So there are certainly factors to consider before signing on the dotted line for a 2009 Toyota Camry Hybrid. However, with a price that makes sense for your bank account and gas mileage that makes sense for the environment, the Camry Hybrid, well, makes a lot of sense. The gasoline part of the Camry's hybrid equation is provided by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder producing 147 hp and 138 pound-feet of torque. The electric motor adds another 40 hp, for a grand total of 187 horses when driving conditions call for maximum power. The Camry Hybrid can also be motivated by electricity alone, but only under light throttle applications at speeds below 30 mph. Although rapid acceleration is hardly a priority for hybrid buyers, the Camry goes from zero to 60 mph in a respectable 8.4 seconds. Power is sent to the front wheels via a specialized continuously variable transmission (CVT).Fuel economy is an impressive 33 mpg city, 34 mpg highway and 34 mpg combined. The Camry Hybrid is also an Advanced Technology Partial-Zero Emissions Vehicle, the cleanest possible rating for a gasoline-burning vehicle in terms of air pollution. In some cases, a city's air could actually be dirtier than what's coming out of this Camry's tailpipe. The 2009 Toyota Camry Hybrid features standard front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag, antilock brakes, stability control and traction control. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash testing, the Camry Hybrid received five out of five stars in all front and side collision categories. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety also awarded the Camry its highest rating of \"Good\" for frontal-offset and side collision protection. Driving the 2009 Toyota Camry Hybrid can be a bit odd due to the CVT, electric motor and eerily quiet cabin at traffic lights. Unlike many other hybrids, though, the Camry Hybrid offers relatively brisk acceleration, meaning you don't necessarily have to sacrifice performance for good fuel economy. While the Camry offers a smooth ride and quiet cabin, its isolation takes a toll in terms of road feel and general driving dynamics. Although the Camry's cabin looks snazzier than in years past, the general quality has slipped a bit in terms of build quality and materials. It's still OK for most buyers, but we've come to expect better from Toyota, and more discerning customers should find the Nissan Altima Hybrid more impressive.What it lacks in polish, though, the Camry Hybrid makes up for with space, quiet and comfort. While the regular Camry provides a serenely hushed environment, the Hybrid's ability to travel using only electric power makes it rival the moon tomb for quietude. The Camry's comfy seats and oodles of cubbies and compartments make it a very family-friendly environment. The hybrid system's battery packs chew into trunk space (10.6 cubic feet versus 15 in the regular Camry), although a 60/40-split/folding rear seatback provides some added utility when needed. Grouped together into various packages, Camry Hybrid options include a sunroof, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a four-way power passenger seat, a navigation system, satellite radio and a JBL sound system with a six-CD changer and Bluetooth.",

    "full_description": "The 2007 Toyota Tacoma gets only minor changes. Its front seats have been upgraded, and the dash and audio head units have been revised. Capable and highly configurable, the 2007 Toyota Tacoma is an ideal choice for those seeking a compact or midsize pickup. Building off a heritage that started more than 40 years ago, Toyota has been the most successful import brand in America in terms of truck sales the past few years. Though its new full-size Tundra will receive a lot of attention this year, the midsize Tacoma remains closer to Toyota's roots and is still an excellent choice for many consumers.Shoppers who haven't looked at compact pickups in a while might be surprised to learn that most aren't really compact anymore. Based on a full redesign from two model years ago, the American and Mexican-built 2007 Toyota Tacoma is representative of a new breed of midsize pickup truck. Bigger and stronger than the traditional compact, the truck can take on a surprising amount of towing and hauling duties thanks to its stout frame and available 236-horsepower V6 engine.One main advantage to the Tacoma is its diversity of cab configurations and styles. It's available in regular, extended-cab (Toyota calls it an Access Cab) and crew cab (Double Cab) body styles in both two- and four-wheel drive. In addition, there's the popular PreRunner version that offers the look and suspension of the four-wheel-drive trucks sans the actual four-wheel-drive running gear. Other specialized models include a long-bed version of the crew cab and a street performance-oriented X-Runner.Also impressive is the Tacoma's overall interior design. With plenty of room in every direction, the Tacoma avoids the claustrophobic feeling typically associated with previous compact pickup trucks. A composite cargo bed comes standard on all models and incorporates built-in storage units, adjustable tie-down anchors and even an optional 400-watt electrical outlet.Having thoroughly tested the Toyota Tacoma, our editors have come away impressed. Versatile, powerful and off-road-worthy, the Tacoma has no major faults. It has won two successive Editors' Most Wanted awards and ranks extremely high in Edmunds' True Cost to Own (TCO) measurements. Though we also suggest taking a look at another favorite of ours, the Nissan Frontier, the 2007 Toyota Tacoma is an excellent choice for those shopping for a compact or midsize pickup truck. All regular and extended-cab models are available with either four- or six-cylinder engines, while the crew-cab models use the V6 exclusively. Standard is a 2.7-liter, four-cylinder engine producing 159 hp and 180 pound-feet of torque. The 4.0-liter V6 engine serves up 236 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices include either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic for the four-cylinder, while V6 buyers can choose between a six-speed manual and a five-speed automatic. Rear-wheel or four-wheel drive is offered for all body styles. Equipped with the V6 engine, the Tacoma's maximum tow rating is 6500 pounds. Antilock brakes with brake assist are standard on all 2007 Toyota Tacoma trucks. A stability control system is optional on all models. Crew cab models also offer optional front-seat side airbags and roll-sensing full-length head curtain airbags. Hill-start Assist Control (HAC) and Downhill Assist Control (DAC) are provided for 4WD models equipped with an automatic transmission, stability control and the off-road package. In NHTSA testing, the Tacoma received a top five-star rating for its protection of occupants in frontal and side-impact crashes. The IIHS posts a top rating of \"Good\" for offset frontal-impact protection. While the standard four-cylinder is certainly adequate, the 4.0-liter V6 is a terrific all-around performer, with plenty of guts down low and a willingness, albeit a noticeably noisy one, to spin into the upper rev ranges. Additionally, towing heavy loads is no undue burden for this powertrain. In terms of handling, the 2007 Toyota Tacoma feels like a true pickup truck from behind the wheel. It excels in off-road situations and is decently comfortable on the street. But dependent on the load and type of suspension equipped, it can seem skittish or bouncy at times. The Tacoma's interior isn't particularly flashy, but it does provide plenty of practicality and comfort. The gauges are straightforward and the controls are easy to use. Storage space is also abundant, and the Double Cab's rear seat is comfortable for adults. Many drivers complain about the positioning of the driver seat, however, saying that it's too close to the floor. For hauling cargo, a non-rusting and dent-resistant composite cargo bed comes standard on all models. Furthering utility is an optional bed-mounted 115-volt/400-watt electrical outlet. Generally, the larger the Tacoma you buy, the more features you get. Regular cabs are meant primarily for workhorse duty and are only lightly equipped; amenities include a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, twin auxiliary power outlets and a four-speaker CD stereo. The more popular Tacoma Access Cab comes standard with air-conditioning, an overhead console and a six-speaker sound system. The Tacoma Double Cab adds keyless entry, power windows and locks, and upgraded seat fabric. Additional convenience features are available only through a variety of optional packages. Most 4WD models can be equipped with an Off-Road Package. On all body styles, the PreRunner designation means the truck is RWD but has the buff look of a 4WD truck. There's also a Tacoma Access Cab X-Runner that has special street performance-enhancing hardware, along with an in-dash CD changer and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter.",

    "full_description": "The 2007 Toyota Tundra is completely redesigned. Larger and stronger than before, Toyota's full-size truck offers three cab sizes, three bed lengths and three engine choices, including an all-new 381-horsepower 5.7-liter V8. A true full-size truck, the 2007 Toyota Tundra is as strong as anything in the class when it comes to acceleration, road manners and equipment availability. If you're shopping for a pickup this year, this is one you won't want to miss. Since its 2000 introduction, the Toyota Tundra has served mainly recreational pickup truck buyers. Not quite full-size in dimensions or work capacity, the original Tundra appealed to those seeking an easy-to-drive commuter vehicle capable of handling weekend trips to the hardware store. But with the Tundra's smallish V8 and low tow rating, Toyota was hard-pressed to attract more serious truck people, namely independent contractors and those who haul heavier payloads and trailers. So these shoppers continued to buy the larger, stronger domestic-brand entries. That's likely to change in 2007. Toyota has completely redesigned the Tundra, creating a truck of true full-size proportions. With a stout frame, three cab sizes, three bed lengths and three engines, including a new 5.7-liter V8, the 2007 Toyota Tundra stands on equal footing with all of the traditional Big Three pickups.With the wider variety of configurations, it's much easier to equip a 2007 Tundra for dual use as a work-site vehicle and family hauler. The medium-size Double Cab, which is now the extended-cab version of the Tundra, is as large as many competitors' crew cabs, while the massive Tundra CrewMax has the roomiest crew cab in the full-size segment, surpassing even Dodge's MegaCab in this regard. Although the CrewMax comes with only a 5.5-foot bed, Toyota gives Tundra Regular Cab and Double Cab buyers the option of either a 6.5-foot or 8-foot bed -- a level of flexibility previously seen only from the domestic manufacturers. You'll find items like a six-speed automatic transmission, stability control and side curtain airbags on the standard equipment list of all '07 Tundras, while useful features like a bed rail system (with adjustable tie-down cleats), extendable towing mirrors and a backup camera are on the options sheet.Any way you look at it, the 2007 Toyota Tundra is a remarkable truck, excelling in all the areas in which its predecessor fell short. For full-size truck buyers with serious towing and hauling requirements, it's a must-drive: It's just as quick (and in many cases, quicker) than its competitors, including the Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra twins, Dodge Ram, Ford F-150 and Nissan Titan, and its six-speed transmission gives it an advantage over many of these trucks when there's a trailer hitched to the back. It also boasts generous interior room and a wide availability of features.For those who need a full-size truck that's durable enough to take a beating, as opposed to a comfy daily driver, the 2007 Toyota Tundra is certainly one of the top contenders in the half-ton class. However, in Toyota's bid to go after the hard-core crowd, the company risks putting off buyers who liked the original Tundra's easygoing demeanor. While the new truck's road manners are polished, it feels much bigger behind the wheel and it doesn't hold a significant advantage over its peers in the ride and handling department. It's generally comfortable and quiet, but by no means does it drive like a Camry. In addition, compared to the upscale interior treatments in GM's pickups, the Tundra's cabin comes off as plasticky and utilitarian. Depending on your priorities, you may want to shop around a bit before buying a Tundra. Three engines are available on the 2007 Toyota Tundra half-ton truck. Standard on the Tundra Regular Cab and standard-bed Double Cab is a 4.0-liter V6 rated for 236 hp and 266 pound-feet of torque. Optional on these models and standard on all other Tundras is a 4.7-liter V8 capable of 271 hp and 313 lb-ft of torque. Optional across the line is a much stronger 5.7-liter V8 good for 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque.The base V6 and 4.7-liter V8 use a five-speed automatic transmission. With either of these engines, your Tundra will have a 3.91 rear axle ratio unless you get the towing package, which provides a 4.10 ratio. The big V8 is paired with a six-speed automatic; 4.10 rear gears are standard and the tow package comes with a 4.30 ratio. All versions of the Tundra can be equipped with two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, and all trucks come with a limited-slip rear differential. A properly equipped 4x2 Tundra Regular Cab can tow up to 10,800 pounds. The Tundra's maximum Gross Combined Weight Rating or GCWR (the total weight of the vehicle, including trailer, cargo, passengers and fuel load) is 16,000 pounds. All 2007 Toyota Tundras come with antilock disc brakes, traction and stability control, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags. The Tundra Regular Cab (which has no rear seat) has a manual cut-off switch for the passenger-side front airbag. Equipped with the 5.7-liter V8, the 2007 Toyota Tundra is ridiculously powerful and the engine's delivery is impressively smooth. Shifts from the six-speed automatic transmission are prompt, and the console shifter is precise in its action, allowing drivers to make full use of the manual mode on highway grades and in off-road situations. We timed a 5.7-liter V8-equipped Tundra Double Cab at a stunning 6.3 seconds for the 0-60-mph acceleration run.Like most of today's half-ton trucks, the Tundra provides a smooth and quiet highway ride, although trucks with the off-road package tend to feel choppy over rain-grooved expressway pavement. Light, precise steering makes for easy maneuvering in the parking lot, but some buyers may find it a bit too light at highway speeds. Handling is predictable around corners and body roll is well-contained. Unlike the previous-generation Tundra, though, this truck never stops feeling like a large vehicle and doesn't hold a significant handling advantage over competitors like the Silverado, F-150, Ram or Titan. Braking ability is a strong point of the new Tundra, as it provides a firm, progressive pedal feel and respectable stopping distances, with minimal fade under heavy use. Although Limited models have electroluminescent gauges, the emphasis is on utility and durability inside the Tundra's cabin. The front seats are wide and accommodating, storage areas and cupholders are generous in size and quantity, and build quality is tight. Soft-touch surfaces are few and far between, though the consistent graining on the plastics lends the cabin a cohesive feel. Although attractive, the individual binnacle gauges are not as easy to read as they should be. The center stack controls are large and well organized, but particularly in Tundras with the navigation system, they're mounted too far to the right to allow for easy reach from the driver seat. Regular Cabs offer comfortable seats as well as a considerable amount of interior cargo space behind the seats. In Double Cabs, the backseat is fully usable for adults and front-hinged rear doors allow for easy entry. The CrewMax offers the roomiest rear-seat accommodations in the entire pickup truck class. With 44.5 inches of rear legroom, even 6-footers can stretch out and cross their legs. The DX starts you out with 18-inch steel wheels, a 40/20/40 cloth bench seat, dual-zone air-conditioning and a four-speaker CD stereo with an MP3 player input jack. The SR5 adds chrome bumpers, additional front-seat adjustments, an extra pair of stereo speakers, cruise control, full power accessories, keyless entry and rear heater ducts. Long-bed versions of the Double Cab SR5 also get towing preparation (which includes a tow/haul mode for the transmission and manually extendable exterior mirrors), and CrewMax SR5 models get heated mirrors, rear A/C ducts, a reclining rear bench seat and a sliding rear window with a defroster. Tundra Limited models add alloy wheels, slightly wider tires, a bed rail system with adjustable tie-downs, leather upholstery, front captain's chairs with 10-way power adjustment for the driver, a telescoping steering wheel, automatic climate control, a 10-speaker JBL sound system with an in-dash CD changer, Bluetooth and power-retractable exterior mirrors with an auto-dimming feature. (Note that Limited CrewMax models get an extra pair of audio speakers for a total of 12.)Major options include a navigation system, a backup camera, 20-inch wheels and, on the CrewMax only, a sunroof. The TRD Off Road Package provides an upgraded suspension with Bilstein shocks, BFGoodrich all-terrain tires and foglamps. An appearance package is available for Regular and Double Cab buyers seeking a monochromatic look.",

    "full_description": "For 2013, Toyota has dropped the previous Sequoia's smaller base V8 engine. An optional Blu-ray rear-seat entertainment system is now available.  With class-leading refinement, versatility and user-friendly features, the 2013 Toyota Sequoia is one of the top picks among full-size SUVs. Full-size, truck-based SUVs like the 2013 Toyota  Sequoia are becoming rarer with each new model year, as buyers who don't need  big-time towing or off-road capabilities are switching to more carlike  crossovers. But if those qualities are still a big part of your vehicle needs,  the Sequoia should work out well.\nThe Sequoia may have the bones of Toyota's big Tundra  pickup, but its ride quality is quite agreeable. The Platinum trim's adaptive  air suspension ups the ante even further, delivering luxury-car isolation and  comfort. You get performance that befits a luxury vehicle, too, as Toyota's  smooth but muscular 381-horsepower 5.7-liter V8 becomes the Sequoia's only  available engine for 2013. The V8's thirst means it isn't going to win any  save-the-earth awards, but it seems only barely troubled to move the 2013  Sequoia's ample mass.\nIf you're shopping for a vehicle primarily to haul  around a lot of people and have the all-weather security of four-wheel drive,  we'll be the first to recommend one of the numerous large crossovers available.  They serve the same purpose, but they're easier to drive and park and don't hit  you with the fuel economy penalty for truck-type capabilities you may rarely,  if ever, put to use. Toyota's own Highlander is one crossover alternative that seats three rows of occupants, as  does the 2013 Chevrolet Traverse.\nIf you do have towing needs or other heavy-duty uses,  however, nothing but a truck-type SUV will get the job done, and the 2013  Toyota Sequoia surely is one of the most comfortable ways to do it. The Sequoia  rides better and has a more sophisticated interior than the stalwart class  choice, the 2013 Chevy Tahoe,  while its beefy V8 outshines the power available from the Ford Expedition. The 2013 Toyota Sequoia comes standard with a  5.7-liter V8 that generates 381 hp and 401 pound-feet of torque. The Sequoia's  V8 is backed by a six-speed automatic transmission, and rear-wheel drive is  standard for all trim levels. Four-wheel drive with low-range gearing is  optional.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, a Sequoia powered by  the 5.7-liter V8 hustled from zero to 60 mph in a quick 6.7 seconds. EPA fuel  economy is 13 mpg city/18 mpg highway and 15 mpg combined with rear-drive and  13/17/14 with four-wheel drive. The two-wheel-drive Sequoia can tow up to 7,400  pounds; the tow rating drops to 7,100 pounds for four-wheel-drive SR5 and  Limited models and 7,000 pounds for the four-wheel-drive Sequoia Platinum. Standard safety equipment for all 2013 Toyota Sequoias  includes antilock disc brakes, stability control, traction control, trailer  sway control, front-seat side-impact airbags, front knee airbags and three-row  side curtain airbags. Front and rear parking sensors and a back-up camera are  standard on Limited and Platinum trim levels. A blind spot warning system is  standard on the Platinum version.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Toyota Sequoia required  127 feet to come to a stop from 60 mph, which is a short distance for SUVs in  this class. You'll never forget the 2013  Toyota Sequoia is a large vehicle, but thanks to its independent rear  suspension and quick (but numb) hydraulic power steering, there's a surprising  nimbleness to be found. At least until it's time to park. There, the upper  trim's standard parking sensors prove invaluable.\nOn the go, the Sequoia soaks up  the worst the road surface has to offer, particularly the Platinum model thanks  to its adjustable suspension. Equally satisfying is the 2013 Sequoia's  powertrain: The 5.7-liter V8 is powerful, silken and near silent until you pin  the throttle. We also like the six-speed automatic, which is responsive even  when towing. The  Sequoia's passenger cabin offers abundant room for passengers, cargo or a  combination of the two. Whether you opt for the eight- or seven-passenger  variation, you'll find a more comfortable and versatile cabin than its rivals.  The second-row seats in particular not only recline, but slide fore and aft for  extra legroom: a rare feature among full-size SUVs. The center section of the  40/20/40-split second-row bench also slides forward to put little ones within  easy reach of mom and dad. Controls are generally easy to use, but those for  the audio system require a long reach for the driver.\nThe  Sequoia's interior is well set up for carrying stuff, too, with 66.6 cubic feet  of cargo space behind the second-row seats. While the popular Chevy Tahoe  requires you to remove and stow its heavy third-row seats in order to maximize  cargo space, the Sequoia's independent rear suspension allows its 60/40-split  third-row seats to quickly fold down into the floor to create a vast 121 cubic  feet of cargo space with all the rear seats folded. In the Limited and Platinum  models, they fold with the touch of a button. \nThe SR5 base model comes standard with 18-inch alloy wheels,  foglights, heated mirrors, a roof rack, running boards, privacy glass, a towing  package, a sunroof, keyless entry, a power vertically sliding rear window,  cruise control, tri-zone automatic climate control, power front seats  (eight-way driver, four-way passenger), a 40/20/40 sliding and reclining  second-row bench seat, 60/40-split reclining and fold-flat third-row bench,  cloth upholstery, cruise control, a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, and an eight-speaker  sound system with a CD player, satellite radio, an auxiliary audio jack and an  iPod/USB audio interface.\nThe Limited adds 20-inch alloy wheels, power-folding and  auto-dimming mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, a power liftgate, leather  upholstery, 10-way power driver seat (adds adjustable lumbar), heated front  seats, a power reclining and folding third-row seat, upgraded gauges, a rearview  camera, rear side window sunshades (second and third rows) and a premium  14-speaker JBL sound system with a six-CD changer. Available options on Limited  models include second-row captain's chairs, a Blu-ray rear-seat entertainment  system and a navigation system with a touchscreen interface and Toyota's Entune  app-based smartphone capability.\nThose options are included on the top-of-the-line  Sequoia Platinum, which also adds 20-inch chrome-clad alloy wheels,  load-leveling rear air springs, adaptive shock absorbers, adaptive cruise  control, perforated leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, a 12-way  power driver seat (adds thigh adjustment), driver memory functions, a  power-adjustable steering wheel and heated second-row captain's chairs.",

    "full_description": "The  Toyota Tundra has received some updates over the years, including a fresh new  look and even an impressive list of modern safety equipment. But the reality is  that the truck underneath is  more  than a decade old. On one hand, this means the Tundra holds some appeal as a  no-nonsense workhorse with a robust V8 engine. But if you're looking for the  latest and greatest, you're not going to find it here.  For  2020, the Tundra now only offers one powertrain: a 5.7-liter V8. Last year, a  4.6-liter V8 was standard and the 5.7-liter optional, but Toyota has ditched  the smaller engine for now. Inside, the Tundra gets Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto for 2020. But there are still some disappointing cabin materials  surrounding the infotainment interface, and the general cabin layout is dated. If  you're looking to tow or haul on the regular, the Tundra has you covered with  the standard V8 and a standard 4.30 axle ratio \u2014 the combo lifts  towing capacity right around 10,000 pounds on every trim level. Fuel economy  suffers quite a bit, however, and virtually every rival has an optional towing  package that will get you an even higher tow rating. The  Tundra is a capable truck, no doubt, and the TRD lineup offers some cool  off-road options to choose from. But overall, we'd recommend taking a closer  look at one of the Tundra's more recently redesigned rivals, including the  Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Ford F-150 and Ram 1500. Available  with a number of optional upgrades, but reasonably priced, we recommend the  Tundra SR5. It might be just one  rung above the base SR, but the SR5 adds an upgraded 8-inch infotainment  interface and has access to a larger fuel tank (via the Upgrade package) as  well as some off-road equipment via the TRD Sport package. How does the Tundra drive? The 5.7-liter V8 has plenty of thrust, but that's about the best thing we can say about the Tundra's performance. The brake pedal is numb and provides little driver confidence during emergency braking. Around corners, the steering is vague and the large steering wheel doesn't return to center well. Handling feels unsettled at times, too, especially on tight roads.     We do like that Toyota offers the off-road-ready TRD Pro version. But for routine driving, nearly every full-size truck is more agile, maneuverable and modern. How comfortable is the Tundra? Comfort is below average in the Tundra. The seats are stiffly padded and aren't very supportive \u2014 most drivers will have issues getting comfortable. The Tundra rides OK over small ruts, but you'll definitely feel larger bumps and potholes because of the stiff and unforgiving suspension. We imagine a significant payload would settle things down a bit, but it's hard to live with every day. Wind and road noise is present most of the time.     Our SR5 test vehicle didn't have many creature comforts, but the single-zone climate control is easy to master because of its logical layout and big, easy-to-grasp knobs. The small vents mean you have to crank up the A/C to cool down the cabin in a hurry. How\u2019s the interior? The Tundra's interior is functional but dated. The controls are large and well-labeled, and the redundant buttons next to the touchscreen are useful. It's spacious inside too, with enough room for adults in all the major seating positions.     Forward visibility is good. However, there's a huge blind spot over both shoulders, and the blind-spot monitoring system doesn't always detect what's back there. The lack of visibility also makes maneuvering into a parking spot a challenge. How\u2019s the tech? Technology is a weak point for the Tundra. The base stereo has an underpowered six-speaker unit that doesn't get very loud. But when you turn it up, it distorts easily. At least Bluetooth and USB audio connect relatively quickly on a consistent basis.    The factory voice controls for music and phone calls work well but only under a very specific menu structure \u2014 the system doesn't respond well to casual language. On the plus side, the Tundra comes standard with features such as adaptive cruise control, automated emergency braking and lane departure monitoring. On the minus side, some of these systems are overly sensitive to neighboring vehicles. How are the towing and storage? The max payload rating for the Tundra is competitive, but the bed's load-in height is high. You can't get a fancy tailgate like you can on some of the newer trucks either. Thankfully, the 5.7-liter V8 and standard 4.30 axle ratio give most Tundras a tow rating around 10,000 pounds. Plus, the Tundra comes standard with an integrated electronic trailer brake controller.    The back seat is massive, so you can fit most child seats without a problem. But it's poorly laid out for hauling large cargo items because of a sizable hump in the center of the floor. Small-item storage is lacking because many of the spaces are small by segment standards. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Tundra's EPA ratings are well below average. The six-speed automatic holds it back, as does the standard high axle ratio. Other truckmakers hide the negative effects of towing axle ratios by making them optional, but at least with them, you get the choice. As a silver lining, we've found the EPA estimates to be achievable in real-world testing. Is the Tundra a good value? For a bare-bones work truck, the Tundra has some appeal. But when you start adding options, the pricing becomes less competitive. Almost every rival packs better bang for the buck. The cabin materials feel cheap and dated, even if the tolerances are tight.     The standard three-year/36,000-mile warranty and five years/60,000 miles for powertrain coverage are about average for the segment. Scheduled maintenance and roadside assistance for two years/25,000 miles are on the house, which is nice. What the Tundra lacks in objective performance metrics, it makes up for with a bit of personality. The 5.7-liter V8 gives you a great soundtrack, and any of the off-road packages will make you feel like a hero in the dirt. Plus, no matter where you go or what you do, this big Toyota won't let you forget that you're driving a brute-force pickup, not some compromised daily driver.",

    "full_description": "The 2012 Toyota Tundra has just a few minor changes including simplified option packages, a new Chrome Appearance package and a standard rearview camera on Limited models. The 2012 Toyota Tundra combines strong powertrain choices and a selection of spacious cabs to deliver a real workhorse of a pickup. It used to be that full-size pickup trucks were  primarily judged on no-nonsense qualities like reliability, durability and  competence for the job at hand. By these traditional measures, the 2012 Toyota  Tundra can go toe to toe with anything Detroit's Big Three automakers have to  offer. These days, though, most people evaluate these trucks beyond their core  competencies, and it's here where you'll decide whether the Tundra is for you.\nThere's no question that the half-ton Tundra rivals  its Ford, GM and Ram competitors in everything from towing capacity to the  dizzying array of possible configurations. Under the hood you have a choice of  three engines, including a 381-horsepower 5.7-liter V8 that allows the Tundra  to tow trailers that weigh up to 10,400 pounds.\nThere are also three body styles, three bed lengths  and two trim levels available, culminating in the top-of-the-line CrewMax  Limited model with its limolike rear seat and upscale car-style amenities  including dual-zone automatic climate control, heated and ventilated front  seats and a 12-speaker JBL audio system. Double Cab models also offer an  adult-friendly backseat and front-hinged rear doors that make for easier access  than the rear-hinged designs found in extended-cab pickups from Ford and GM.\nWhile all this compares favorably with the  competition, the Tundra hasn't received significant upgrades since the truck's launch  in 2007. This means the big Texas-built Toyota is a few steps behind its more  recently remade rivals in key areas. In particular, the Ram 1500 has a coil-spring  rear suspension that gives it a comparatively more comfortable ride, while the Ford F-150 has a more  advanced engine lineup, while numerous innovative features make it the  cutting-edge choice among pickup trucks. The Tundra enjoys a few advantages  over the even older Chevrolet Silverado  and GMC Sierra, such as a more spacious cabin,  but GM's trucks nevertheless remain solid choices.\nMost  of these advantages and disadvantages are pretty minor. Ultimately, the 2012  Toyota Tundra definitely stands tall as a full-size pickup.  The 2012 Toyota Tundra is offered with a choice of  three different engines and rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive.\nRear-wheel-drive Regular and Double Cabs are powered  by a 4.0-liter V6 that puts out 270 hp and 278 pound-feet of torque. A  five-speed automatic transmission is standard. EPA-estimated fuel economy for  this powertrain is 16 mpg city/20 mpg highway and 18 mpg highway.\nA 4.6-liter V8 that produces 310 hp and 327 lb-ft of  torque is standard on CrewMax, four-wheel-drive and long-bed models, and  available as an option on rear-wheel-drive Regular and Double Cab body styles.  A six-speed automatic transmission is standard. In Edmunds testing, a  four-wheel-drive Tundra with the 4.6-liter V8 went from zero to 60 mph in 7.9  seconds. EPA-estimated fuel economy for this engine is 15 mpg city/20 mph  highway and 17 mpg combined with two-wheel drive and 14/19/16 with four-wheel  drive.\nTopping the Tundra's engine lineup is a 5.7-liter V8 standard  on Limited trim levels and optional on the other models. It produces 381 hp and  401 lb-ft of torque, while a six-speed automatic transmission is standard.  EPA-estimated fuel economy is 14 mpg city/18 mpg highway and 15 mpg combined for  two-wheel-drive models and 13/17/14 for four-wheel-drive versions. A four-wheel-drive  Tundra CrewMax with this engine went from zero to 60 mph in 6.9 seconds in  Edmunds testing. Tundras equipped with the 5.7-liter V8 and the optional Tow  package can pull trailers up to 10,400 pounds. The 2012 Toyota Tundra comes standard with antilock  brakes (with brake assist), stability and traction control, trailer sway  control, front side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags that cover both rows  and front knee airbags. In Edmunds brake testing, a Tundra Double Cab with the  4.6-liter V8 came to a stop from 60 mph in 134 feet -- a good distance for a  full-size truck.\nIn government crash tests the Tundra earned an overall  score of four stars (out of a possible five), as well as four stars for overall  frontal protection and five stars for overall side protection. The Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety gave the Tundra its highest rating of \"Good\"  in the frontal-offset, side-impact and roof strength tests. When  the Tundra was first introduced, any model that carried an engine other than  the 5.7-liter V8 was a letdown. However, the midgrade 310-hp 4.6-liter V8 means  playing second fiddle isn't necessarily a bad thing. This engine provides all the  muscle most truck buyers need, with better fuel economy to boot. The base V6 is  one of the brawnier base engines in the segment, but V8 grunt seems like a must  in this class. Now, if getting the most V8 grunt is important, the 5.7 isn't  the class leader it once was in terms of horsepower, but it remains a champ for  towing thanks to its axle ratio and a well-sorted six-speed automatic.\nFor  daily use, the 2012 Toyota Tundra's light steering makes the truck very easy to  drive, though it feels bigger than competing trucks. We were satisfied with the  Tundra's ride quality a few years ago, but the Ram's coil-spring rear suspension  and the Ford F-150's revised, sturdier frame make the Tundra's ride seem  stiff-legged by comparison. While the interior of the 2012 Toyota Tundra is  passable by pickup truck standards and even has a few strong points, the fact  that it hasn't been updated in five years makes it seem dated when compared to  the more recently redone passenger cabins of its Ford and Ram competitors. The  Limited trim level equipped with the Platinum option package does add upscale  touches like perforated leather upholstery and heated/ventilated front seats,  but the fact remains that designers have done nothing to address more fundamental  issues like distantly placed audio controls, low-quality materials and the base  model's difficult-to-read gauges.\nFrom a practical standpoint, however, the Tundra  scores. Topping the list of thumbs-up inside is the ridiculously roomy rear  seat in CrewMax models, which combines gobs of legroom with the comfort of  reclining seatbacks. Only the heavy-duty Ram trucks can match its limolike  sprawl space. Another plus are the front-hinged rear doors on Double Cab models  that make getting in and out of the adult-friendly backseat much easier than  the clamshell-style rear doors on some competitors. The folding backseats on  Double Cab and CrewMax models also provide a good amount of protected storage  for valuable items you'd rather not leave in the bed. \nStandard equipment on entry-level Regular Cab models  includes 18-inch steel wheels, chrome bumpers, heated mirrors, full power  accessories, a windshield wiper de-icer, a damped tailgate, power windows, dual-zone  air-conditioning, cloth upholstery, a 40/20/40-split bench seat, a tilt-only  steering wheel and a four-speaker sound system with a CD player and an  auxiliary audio jack.\nThe entry-level Double Cab adds intermittent  windshield wipers, keyless entry, an eight-way manually adjustable driver seat,  60/40-split fold-up rear seats, carpeting, cruise control and two extra  speakers. The CrewMax adds a power vertical-sliding rear window and a sliding,  reclining and fold-flat rear seat.\nMoving up to the Limited trim level, which is only  offered on Double Cab and CrewMax body styles, gets you 18-inch alloy wheels, a  color-keyed front bumper, foglights, a bed rail system with adjustable tie-down  cleats, power-folding and auto-dimming mirrors, dual-zone automatic climate  control, leather upholstery, heated power front bucket seats (10-way driver, four-way  passenger), a power-operated sliding rear window (Double Cab), an auto-dimming  rearview mirror with built-in back-up camera display, upgraded gauges and trip  computer, a tilt-and-telescoping leather-wrapped steering wheel, Bluetooth phone  and audio connectivity, and a JBL premium audio system with a six-CD changer,  10 speakers in the Double Cab and 12 speakers in the CrewMax.\nA long list of packages and stand-alone options makes  it possible to add many of the Limited's standard features to the base Tundra,  though more of them are available on the Double Cab. Limited models can also be  had with 20-inch alloy wheels, running boards and a navigation system with a  touchscreen interface, voice controls and real-time traffic. The CrewMax  Limited can also be loaded up with a rear-seat entertainment system and a  Platinum package that includes 20-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof, perforated  leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, driver memory functions and  the navigation system.\nThere are also a dizzying array of available option  packages, including a Tow package that bundles a heftier axle ratio, a hitch  receiver, a transmission Tow/Haul mode, oil and transmission fluid coolers, a  heavy-duty battery, upgraded alternator and a seven-pin connector. A Work Truck  package strips base Regular and Double Cab models of convenience features like  power mirrors, keyless entry and cruise control and substitutes black bumpers,  vinyl upholstery and heavy-duty rubber flooring.\nStyling-oriented packages include a Chrome Appearance package  (base Double Cab models only) and a Sport Appearance package. There are also  several off-road-oriented equipment groups. The TRD Off-Road package adds  special 18-inch alloy wheels, off-road tires, an off-road-tuned suspension, skid  plates and tow hooks (the Regular Cab version also adds many of the convenience  niceties found on the other body styles). The TRD Rock Warrior package (base  Double Cab and CrewMax only) is similar, but includes 17-inch forged alloy  wheels and all-terrain tires, along with a matte black rear bumper and many of  the convenience options.",

    "full_description": "The 2016 RAV4 Hybrid is a new variant in the RAV4 lineup this year. Like all RAV4s this year, it's the beneficiary of a midcycle refresh that brings revised styling and updated features. With all-wheel drive and hybrid-amplified fuel economy, the 2016 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid occupies a niche among compact crossovers. Its combination of features, passenger space and everyday utility warrant a closer look if you're shopping for a small crossover. Toyota  has been a mainstay in the compact crossover SUV segment for a long time,  having created it in the first place with the original RAV4 back in 1996. It's  also been a leader in the hybrid field with its fuel-sipping Prius and Camry  hybrids. Alas, we've had to wait until 2016 for Toyota to decide to finally marry  the two together in the form of the new 2016 RAV4 Hybrid.\n\nThe 2016 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid looks very similar to the  regular RAV4. Most people won't know you're driving a hybrid.\nIt  turns out that the RAV4 Hybrid is more than just the most fuel-efficient  vehicle in its class. It's also the most fuel-efficient all-wheel-drive hybrid vehicle  you can buy. Fitted with a hybrid powertrain borrowed from the Lexus NX 300h  and Toyota Camry Hybrid, the RAV4 Hybrid delivers an EPA-estimated 33 mpg  combined, which is 8 mpg more than a regular all-wheel-drive RAV4. Interestingly,  it also accelerates from a standstill to 60 mph about a second quicker than its  non-hybrid stablemate and provides nearly as much total cargo space.\nToyota  has positioned the RAV4 Hybrid as a more premium model among RAV4s, and as such  the hybrid is only offered in the highest two trim levels. Yet the hybrid  powertrain itself commands very little additional outlay over the equivalent  non-hybrid RAV4. The hybrid also benefits from the same updates the regular RAV4  gets this year, including subtly massaged exterior styling and a new suite of  high-tech accident-avoidance technologies.\nIf  you like the idea of a miserly small crossover but want to shop around, you'll  quickly find the new RAV4 Hybrid is pretty much in a class by itself. The only  other hybrid SUV in this price range is the 2016  Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid. It does return similar  fuel economy to the RAV4 Hybrid but it's considerably slower and not nearly as  roomy on the inside. Toyota took its sweet time coming up with the RAV4 Hybrid,  but it's worth the wait. The  RAV4 Hybrid's powertrain consists of a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, electric  motors front and rear, a nickel-metal hydride battery pack and a continuously  variable transmission (CVT). In total, this pairing develops a combined system  output of 194 horsepower. The RAV4 Hybrid is front-wheel drive in normal  operation, but the powertrain automatically engages the electrically driven  rear wheels when needed to provide enhanced traction in slippery conditions.\nAccording  to the EPA, the hybrid hardware allows the RAV4 Hybrid to deliver 33 mpg  combined (34 city/31 highway). The  2016 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid includes antilock brakes, stability and traction  control, front side airbags, full-length airbags, a driver knee airbag, a  rearview camera and an integrated driver blind-spot mirror. A blind-spot  warning system and rear cross-traffic alert are optional on the XLE and  standard on the Limited.\nThe  optional Toyota Safety Sense system (standard on the Limited) includes a  forward collision warning system (with pedestrian detection), forward collision  mitigation with automatic emergency braking, a lane-departure warning and  intervention system and automatic high-beam headlight control.\nSpecific  crash tests for the hybrid were not available as of this writing, but in government  crash tests the regular RAV4 received five  out of five stars for overall crash protection, with four stars for  total frontal protection and five stars for total side protection. The  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the regular 2016 RAV4 the best  possible rating of \"Good\" in  the small- and moderate-overlap frontal-offset crash test as well as the  side-impact and roof-strength tests. It also received a \"Good\" rating  for the performance of its head restraints and seats, as well as the best  possible rating of \"Superior\" for its available forward collision  warning and mitigation system. The  RAV4's hybrid powertrain juices up more than just its acceleration and fuel  economy. In the bargain it boosts refinement, since the transmission never has  any shift shock. It's a smooth and torquey experience that splits the  difference, performance-wise, between base four-cylinder crossovers and ones  with upgraded V6 or turbocharged engines. The hybrid's thrust off the line won't  blow your hair back, but it's noticeably more eager than non-hybrid RAV4s. The  additional sound insulation and other refinements introduced to all RAV4s this  year have also paid off, since this is a commendably quiet and refined vehicle.\n\nThe 2016 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid isn't much fun to drive,  but its fuel economy is excellent.\nBut  it's not particularly sporty, since the additional weight of the hybrid parts  is noticeable when you carve into a corner enthusiastically. In day-to-day  driving, however, it feels composed and delivers good ride quality. The brakes \u2014  which blend the regenerative function of the hybrid hardware with the regular brakes  \u2014 feel a bit synthetic and don't have the reassuring pedal response of  traditional non-hybrid brakes.  The  2016 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid's interior is a stylized mix of hard silver plastic and  soft surfaces that's been around for a few years but is aging well. A few of  the audio and climate controls feel slightly flimsy, however, and while the  cupholder count is adequate, there aren't as many useful storage nooks and  crannies as you'll find in the Honda CR-V. Still, it's a roomy cabin that looks  good and works well. If you want genuine leather upholstery, you're out of luck,  as the RAV4 comes only with cloth or leatherette.\n\nThe 2016 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid loses just a few cubic feet  of total cargo space because of its battery pack.\nAlthough  all of the RAV4's audio systems have Toyota's Entune branding, only models with  the bigger 7-inch screen include the Entune suite of smartphone-connected  services, among these Pandora streaming radio and a navigation app. Thankfully,  the touchscreen interface itself has straightforward menus, large virtual  buttons and faster responses for 2016. All conventional controls are also easy  to use.\nRear  passengers are presented with a low-mounted bottom cushion, but the upside is  that space is abundant even for taller adults. We also like how the 60/40-split  seatbacks provide a large amount of recline adjustment.\nThe  RAV4 Hybrid's cargo area measures 35.6 cubic feet, which is ample, if smaller  than the non-hybrid models, owing to the packaging of its large battery. Fold  down the middle row and the capacity rises to 70.6 cubic feet, which is still  right up there with the largest in its class. The power-operated and  height-adjustable liftgate is especially convenient. \nThe  XLE comes standard with 17-inch wheels, heated outside mirrors, a sunroof, roof  rails, dual-zone automatic climate control, a rearview camera, a  height-adjustable driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a  60/40-split folding and reclining rear seat, a 6.1-inch touchscreen interface  (Entune), a remote power liftgate, keyless entry and ignition, Bluetooth phone  and audio connectivity and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, an  auxiliary audio jack, a USB port and a media player interface.\nStepping  up to the Limited trim level nets you chrome exterior trim, LED headlights,  18-inch wheels, heated outside mirrors, blind spot monitoring, rear  cross-traffic alerts, front and rear parking sensors, synthetic leather upholstery,  heated front seats, an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar), driver  memory settings, adaptive cruise control, a 7-inch touchscreen with navigation,  smartphone app integration and satellite ratio.\n\nToyota packs on the standard features for the 2016 RAV4  Hybrid. Leatherette upholstery is exclusive to the Limited trim level, though.\nOptional  for the XLE is the Entune Premium Audio package, which adds the bigger  touchscreen, nav system and smartphone app integration. The XLE's Convenience  package bundles those features with blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert, front and rear parking sensors and the Safety Sense  package. Limited models offer an optional Advanced Technology package that  includes an 11-speaker JBL premium audio system with a top-down-view parking camera  system.",

    "full_description": "For 2011, the Toyota Tacoma's four-cylinder engine is a more practical choice now that it's available with an automatic transmission. Air-conditioning is now standard on every Tacoma, while all but Regular Cab 4x4 models get bucket seats. The front grille has been slightly redesigned depending on trim level and a pair of new off-road-oriented packages debut. The 2011 Toyota Tacoma is a top choice in the midsize pickup segment thanks to its highly capable nature and wide array of configurations. In the past, you faced a simple choice when the time came to  buy a pickup truck. When gas was cheap and good times continued to roll, it was  easy to justify getting the biggest thing available. In these leaner economic  times, many people are reconsidering their wants versus their needs. You might  want a truck with all that payload, power and space, but perhaps a smaller and  less expensive truck is all you need. In that case, the 2011 Toyota Tacoma should  do nicely.\nSince its last redesign in 2005, the Tacoma has been a  class-leading choice, due largely to its ability to bridge the gap between  small work trucks and full-sizers. Thanks to available four- and six-cylinder  engines and a wide range of body styles that start with the simple Regular Cab and  go up to the Double Cab long bed, both business operators and families alike  should be able to find a Tacoma in a size and style that suits their needs. Toyota  offers the Pre-Runner, X Runner and off-road-capable TRD models to further  cater to a diverse range of potential buyers.\nIn addition to its wide-ranging lineup, the 2011 Toyota Tacoma  further distinguishes itself with its sturdy construction and reputation for  reliability. Another plus is its well-appointed cabin, which greatly outshines the  competition. Of the Tacoma's rivals, the strongest picks are the 2011 Nissan Frontier and  almost identical Suzuki Equator; the American entries are sadly well past their  prime and not really competitive. Still, although both the Frontier and the Equator  are capable choices, neither is impressive enough to challenge the Tacoma's  dominance in the segment. The 2011 Toyota Tacoma is available with rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. All drivetrain and cab configurations other than the 4x4 Double Cab come standard with a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 159 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed manual transmission is standard on the Regular and Access Cabs, while a four-speed automatic is optional on those cabs and standard with the Double Cab. Fuel economy for a 4x2 with the automatic is 19 mpg city/25 mpg highway and 21 mpg combined, while the 4x4 with automatic gets 18/21/19.\nOptional on the Access Cab and 4x2 Double Cab but standard on the 4x4 Double Cab is a 4.0-liter V6 that ups output to 236 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual is standard and a five-speed automatic is optional. In testing, a Tacoma Double Cab V6 turned in a 0-60-mph time of 7.8 seconds, which is suitably quick for a midsize truck. An automatic-equipped 4x2 with the V6 achieves an EPA-estimated 17/21/18, while the 4x4 gets 16/20/18. When properly equipped, the Tacoma can tow 6,500 pounds. Standard safety equipment on all 2011 Tacomas includes stability and traction control, antilock brakes (disc front, drum rear) with brake assist, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and front active headrests. Hill-start assist control (HAC) and downhill assist control (DAC) are available on 4WD models equipped with the automatic transmission.\nIn government crash testing, the 2011 Toyota Tacoma received a top five-star rating for its protection of occupants in frontal and side-impact crashes. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Tacoma its top rating of \"Good\" in its frontal-offset and side crash tests. The Tacoma is the only compact/midsize to receive high marks in both tests, earning it the distinction of being an IIHS Top Safety Pick. Drivers who don't plan on heavy hauling, towing or aggressive accelerating will likely find their needs met by the four-cylinder engine. The beefier V6 is a much more capable choice for more serious work and play, with plenty of low-range pull that continues into the higher revs. The only downside is that it can get a bit noisy at higher rpm.\nFor better or worse, the 2011 Toyota Tacoma drives like a proper pickup truck. It delivers a reasonably comfortable ride on the streets and, properly equipped, tackles off-road terrain without drama. The Tacoma can, however, feel rather twitchy if the bed's empty and the truck's fitted with one of the stiffer suspensions. It's also worth noting that while the brakes ably bring things to a halt, the soft pedal doesn't inspire confidence. The Tacoma doesn't break any new ground in terms of interior design, but it is well built with quality materials and offers plenty of practicality. The attractive metallic interior trim found in higher trim levels adds a bit more refinement, especially when compared to its more industrial rivals. Furthermore, the gimmick-free cockpit benefits from easy-to-read gauges and intuitive controls.\nAdult passengers will find the Double Cab's rear seats roomy and comfortable, while only smaller folk are likely to find the Access Cab's rear accommodations passable. Some of our editors have expressed displeasure with the Tacoma's low-slung front seats, noting that pickups are best served by seats that are higher from the floor. Behind the cab, a substantial composite inner cargo bed does a good job of defending the surface from dents and rust, and an optional bed-mounted 115-volt/400-watt electrical outlet should be a big hit with campers and tailgaters alike. \nAll Tacoma body styles are available in either two- or four-wheel-drive form. Rear-wheel-drive PreRunner versions adopt the rugged look and suspension of their off-road-focused stablemates, but without the added weight, fuel appetite and traction of actual 4WD. The rear-drive-only X-Runner version is more oriented to street performance, with a body kit, 18-inch alloy wheels, standard V6, a lowered sport-tuned suspension, a hood scoop, foglamps and an upgraded stereo.\nAs the base model, the lightly equipped Tacoma Regular Cab is ideal as a work truck; it actually has more standard amenities than other bare-bones pickups. Standard features include 15-inch steel wheels, a limited-slip differential, air-conditioning, a composite bedliner, a bed utility rail system, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a cloth front bench seat and a four-speaker stereo with a CD player and auxiliary audio jack. When equipped with four-wheel drive and an automatic transmission, the Regular Cab gets front bucket seats. The Access Cab gains power locks and windows, upgraded cloth upholstery, front bucket seats, a rear bench (includes under-seat storage) and two more speakers. The Tacoma Double Cab adds 16-inch steel wheels, a front skid plate and driver lumbar adjustment.\nMost options (which can vary by region) are grouped into packages with varying availability depending on body styles and drivetrain choices. The Convenience package adds power mirrors, keyless entry, cruise control, a sliding rear window and steering-wheel audio controls. Several variations of the SR-5 package typically combine exterior and interior enhancements that include a chrome grille and rear bumper, variable-speed wipers, foglamps, upgraded seats, a rearview camera, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a JBL upgraded six-speaker stereo with Bluetooth and satellite radio. Some of these items are available separately.\nThe TRD Off-Road package includes 16-inch alloy wheels, fender flares, a heavy-duty suspension, a locking rear differential, skid plates and sport seats. Both the TX and TX Pro packages add black alloy wheels, all-terrain tires and unique badging; the TX also adds tube side steps, while the TX Pro adds a cat-back exhaust. The on-road-oriented TRD Sport package includes 17-inch alloy wheels, a hood scoop, a sport suspension and sport seats.",

    "full_description": "The Camry is the archetypal midsize family sedan. Though it has grown larger  over many generations, the latest, redesigned 2018 model checks in at roughly  the same exterior dimensions as its predecessor. That's fine \u2014 it's  plenty big enough already, thanks. The 2018 Camry's styling is a big departure  from the norm, however. You  can sense the difference from 10 paces away. The uninspiring styling we've come  to expect on the Toyota Camry has been replaced with a lower and sleeker look.  But sleeker doesn't mean reduced headroom and reduced visibility because the  seats, hood and side glass have dropped a similar amount. In fact, we figure  that interior space has been enhanced.Much  of the credit goes to the stiffer platform and its double-wishbone rear  suspension, the key element that makes this Camry different from any produced  in the last 30-plus years. Past Camrys relied on a rear strut suspension  because of its low cost. But rear struts are bulky and compete for space with  the back seat and trunk. The more sophisticated rear suspension was recently  used on the Toyota Prius, and the positive effects on that car's ride comfort,  road noise, handling and even steering feel were substantial.As  before, there will be three powertrain choices, all of which are either new or  significantly revised. The all-new 2.5-liter four-cylinder base engine makes  203 horsepower, while the optional 3.5-liter V6 now cranks out a stout 301 hp.  Both come paired with a new eight-speed automatic transmission that further  helps improve fuel economy. The fuel-sipping Camry Hybrid (reviewed separately)  is new as well. On the safety front, you'll find a common  array of features including 10 standard airbags and a rearview camera. But the  most impressive safety feature on this new Camry has to be the standard  inclusion of the Toyota Safety Sense-P, which means that even the cheapest 2018  Camry will have traffic-adapting cruise control, automatic emergency braking in  case of an imminent forward collision, lane departure warning and mitigation,  and auto-dimming LED headlights. While we appreciate the Camry's newfound  attention to style, safety and handling precision, Toyota's Entune infotainment  and smartphone integration won't please many people. It just isn't as easy to  use as rival systems. It's the most glaring shortcoming of this otherwise  well-rounded family sedan. If you're in the market, the Camry is going to be  one of your best choices for 2018.Notably, we picked the 2018 Toyota Camry as one of Edmunds' Best Midsize Sedans for 2018.\nWhat's it like to live with?\nBecause of its thoroughly overhauled  cabin and redesigned exterior, the 2018 Toyota Camry was a great addition to  our long-term vehicle testing program. We bought a Camry in the sporty SE trim  and tested it for more than a year. To learn what it was like to live with,  read our long-term test,  where we covered everything from seat comfort to fuel economy. Toyota has completely overhauled its best-selling Camry sedan for 2018. Though the new Camry is roughly the same length as before, it has more cabin space and sharper steering and handling, particularly in SE guise. Still, the Camry's main appeal is its everyday functionality. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the 2018 Toyota Camry XLE (2.5L  inline-4 | 8-speed automatic | FWD). The four-cylinder engine's strong power in the upper rev range gives it satisfactory oomph when you need to accelerate up to highway speeds. But it's less impressive around town when the revs are low. In our tests, the Camry needed 7.9 seconds to reach 60 mph, which is an average time. It's easy to modulate these brakes, and the pedal effort is nicely judged, neither firm nor mushy. Even panic stops are easy to manage. In our testing, the Camry stopped from 60 mph in 122 feet, which is a bit longer than expected for a midsize sedan. Steering is suitably direct and well-weighted, with good on-center feel. It's not exactly sporty in terms of feeling the grip at the front tires, but certainly keener than previous Camrys. Sport mode makes the steering unnecessarily heavy. Well-mannered within its modest limits. Feels tidy for a car of its size in this class. Body roll isn't excessive, though it bobs vertically on bumpy, twisting roads more than we'd like. The SE or XSE should be more controlled. Tire grip is modest. The eight-speed automatic transmission kicks down willingly most of the time and doesn't hunt among gears. It picks up cleanly from a standstill with no lurchiness or pregnant pauses. A pleasant, innocuous driving experience. At first sit, the front seats feel overstuffed, flat and wide. But this impression dissolves quickly because long-trip comfort proves excellent. The seats combine modest bolsters and medium-firm padding with stiff leather. The back seat is upright, with a flat bottom and modestly contoured seatback. Compared to previous Camrys, this car feels more buttoned-down. Not a hint of harshness, though. Typical pavement bumps, whether large or small, are damped well overall. The ride is never wallowy or floaty, but it does exhibit some excessive vertical ride motions on bumpy roads. This isn't a serenely quiet car. The engine is buzzy during acceleration but fades into the background when cruising. There's noticeable wind and road noise, too. This might be the trade-off for the new Camry's somewhat sharper dynamics. Two knobs for temperature and buttons for other controls make for a clean, simple and effective layout. The digital display doesn't wash out. It cools powerfully even in triple-digit heat and operates very quietly, making it even better. The back seat gets two vents as part of an option package. The Camry presents itself well, with no mysteries. Clear, large gauges and simple, well-labeled buttons make it intuitive for anyone to operate. Radio volume and tuning knobs are easy for the driver to reach but are a stretch for the passenger. Typical of Toyotas, the Camry is easy to get into and out of. It has very light doors, a narrow sill and a sizable opening. It's lower than the outgoing car, so there's a smidge more of a drop into the seat. Taller drivers will be pleased with the additional reach of the telescoping wheel, though more would be preferred. A generously sized driver footwell and good relationship of the steering wheel to the pedals and seat make it a very natural drive. Ample head- and legroom for 6-plus-footers. The cabin feels airy. The back seat has ample legroom for 6-footers, though their heads brush the headliner of our panoramic sunroof-equipped test car. A lowish beltline and slim pillars aid the view forward and out the front side windows. Average visibility over your shoulder and out the back window. Optional bird's-eye view camera on our test car provides a clear and comprehensive depiction of the surroundings. A step up from the old Camry in design and materials. Soft-touch surfaces abound, and they look and feel good. Its design and variety of textures won't be mistaken for those of a luxury car, but they're attractive without sacrificing functionality. Our preproduction test car had a couple of creaks. Good but not stellar cabin storage. The forward center console bin is great for concealing items but has a hard, slippery floor so items slide around noisily. The console bin at your elbow is a decent size. The modest door pockets in the front and rear are good for small water bottles only. The large trunk and the 60/40-split folding back seat with trunk-mounted release handles make it easy to expand the space. The trunk is dimensionally similar to the outgoing Camry's trunk, but it seems easier to live with, perhaps due to its wide opening and nicely low liftover height. The audio system layout is simple and effective, with chunky, well-labeled buttons and a clear display even in direct sun. However, built-in navigation is unavailable and it mutes your phone when plugged in, making it impossible to follow a navigation app's audio alerts. Slow to start up. Smartphone users will be disappointed. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not available. Phone pairing via Bluetooth is straightforward but failed on the first attempt. The user must pair Bluetooth and connect a cord running Entune 3.0 to get access to most features. Its many standard driver aids are a nice touch. However, the lane departure warnings are overly sensitive and cannot be turned off, which some drivers will find infuriating. The pre-collision system is too sensitive during routine parking maneuvers and certain acceleration instances. Voice commands are on the clunky side, but at least Siri Eyes Free and Google Voice are available by pressing and holding the voice button. This is a pretty good alternative, and you don't have to run the Entune app to make it work. Go for the SE trim for its more satisfying driving dynamics and more  buttoned-down demeanor. Its ride quality is still quite agreeable, too. As for  options, it's largely about your budget, but we recommend springing for the  Audio package and the Convenience package. The former has a larger touchscreen,  connectivity enhancements, dual-zone climate control and rear vents, while the  latter's keyless ignition and auto-dimming rearview mirror live up to the  package's billing. We also suggest sticking with the four-cylinder engine since  it's fuel-efficient and respectably powerful. All Camrys are equipped with Toyota  Safety Sense, which is a suite of driver assistance features including adaptive  cruise control, a frontal pre-collision system, lane departure alert with  steering assistance, and automatic high beams.Camry L The base L sets the floor for the base price but won't be commonplace due to  its relative paucity of equipment. This Camry comes with 16-inch steel wheels,  automatic LED headlights, cloth upholstery, a height-adjustable driver seat, a  rearview camera, keyless entry, a 7-inch touchscreen interface, one USB port,  Bluetooth and a six-speaker sound system.Camry LE LE models add a few key items that most drivers will  want: an eight-way power-adjustable driver seat (with two-way power lumbar  adjustment), 17-inch alloy wheels, a 60/40-split folding back seat and a car  alarm.Camry SE SE variants mark a personality shift toward keener  driving dynamics courtesy of a sport-tuned suspension and a revised steering  calibration. They also receive 18-inch wheels and simulated leather upholstery  (SofTex) seats and paddle shifters.Camry XLE and XSE You can think of the XLE and XSE trim levels  as versions of the LE and SE, respectively, with a variety of additional  comfort and convenience items. Highlights include larger wheels, dual-zone  automatic climate control, leather upholstery, a head-up display, blind-spot  monitoring, keyless ignition, a power-adjustable front passenger seat, extra  USB ports, a bigger 8-inch touchscreen, a premium JBL sound system and Qi  wireless smartphone charging.Many of the features found on the upper  trim levels can be added to the lower trim levels as options. Other notable  options include a sunroof and a top-down parking camera system.",

    "full_description": "If you want pure efficiency and  eco-friendly driving without the hassle of plugging in your car, the 2018  Toyota Prius remains at the top of the heap. Pretty much nothing short of a  plug-in hybrid will return better real-world results.  We've had a 2016 Prius in our long-term test car fleet, and after more than a year we averaged about  50 mpg, even with thousands of miles spent in brutal Los Angeles traffic. We  also appreciate the Prius' practicality and comfort, with its generous cargo  area and smooth ride quality. Of course, the Prius compromises on acceleration  and handling, proving less rewarding to drive than many traditionally powered  vehicles. There's also the question of Toyota's infotainment system, which  lacks some functionality, and the car's questionable styling.If you're shopping for a hybrid, know  that there's more competition than ever. The Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid actually  claims slightly higher EPA-rated fuel economy than the Prius and offers a  longer warranty. It certainly has a more functional interior with better  technology, too. However, the Ioniq is even less satisfying to drive than the  Prius, and it's a less comfortable place to spend time. There's also the Kia  Niro hybrid, which has the look of an SUV, and a slew of midsize hybrid sedans  to consider. Still, there's a reason the Prius remains  the king of the hybrid cars. If you put a premium on efficiency and value, you  won't be disappointed by the Prius.Notably, we picked the 2018 Toyota Prius as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars and Best Hybrid Cars for this year.\nWhat's it like to live with?\nTo learn more about the Toyota Prius of this generation, read about our experiences from living with a 2016 Toyota Prius. After its debut, we went out and bought one, holding onto it for almost four years and racking up more than 30,000 miles. We cover everything from this hybrid's real-world fuel economy to seat comfort and cargo space. Please note that the 2018 Toyota Prius differs from our long-term 2016 model in that the newer model includes more standard safety features. It's the same generation, though, so most of our observations still apply. If you want pure efficiency and eco-friendly driving without the hassle of plugging in your car, the 2018 Toyota Prius remains at the top of the heap. Pretty much nothing short of a plug-in hybrid will return better real-world results. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the 2016 Toyota Prius Three Hatchback (1.8L inline-4 hybrid | CVT automatic | FWD).NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Prius has received some revisions,  including adjustments to trim-level features and expanded availability of  active safety features. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's  Toyota Prius. Acceleration is adequate. A 9.8-second 0-60 mph time is near the bottom of the segment, though the Prius has enough zip off the line to feel lively around town. In our emergency braking test, the Prius posted average stopping performance. Except at crawling speeds, pedal feel is smooth and linear without any of the awkwardness indicative of many hybrid systems. The steering is direct, though it doesn't provide much feedback from the road. The system is well-weighted, and little effort is required to point the Prius in the intended direction without catching grooves or seams. The Prius feels responsive and reasonably agile on the street. Body roll is present and the tires fight for grip, but the car never feels unwieldy or dangerous. The Prius remains composed over midcorner bumps and dips. The transition from EV to hybrid mode is unobtrusive, though the engine sounds harsh when firing up. Acceleration is smooth. The cruise control holds speed well going both up- and downhill. The seat offers a lot of vertical adjustment, but there's no lumbar adjustment. The seat cushion remains comfortable after long drives. The moderate side bolstering supports without squeezing. The Prius is smooth and composed on the street. Rebound over bumps is minimal, and the car never feels too bouncy or too stiff. Broken or uneven pavement doesn't upset the car or translate into a harsh ride quality. Extremely quiet in EV mode, but the engine provides a noticeable hum, which is exacerbated when the transmission keeps the engine's rpm high. Wind noise is moderate and not overly booming. Single-zone automatic climate control is standard across the board and works reasonably well. The S mode function smartly cuts airflow to unoccupied seats to reduce power use by the A/C system. The heated front seats adequately warm passengers, but the switches' awkward location (hidden under the center console) makes it easy to forget when they're on. The touchscreen is user-friendly and very responsive, but other functions are controlled by touch-capacitive icons and not real buttons. Most controls are simple and well-placed, but the odd shifter design and center-mounted gauges provide no tangible benefit. The Prius is quite easy to get in and out of. The doors open wide allowing easy access to the front. Rear-seat access is also good but is hampered slightly by the sloping roofline. There's generous front head-, legroom and shoulder room. Rear seating is also very good. Forward visibility is great, with large windows and a low dash providing a great view. Rear visibility is OK, but the split in the glass cuts through the sightline. Over-the-shoulder visibility is only slightly hindered by a sloping roof. The Prius feels solidly built, and overall it uses nice materials throughout the cabin. But it is beginning to slip behind competitors such as the Honda Insight and Accord Hybrid. The very plasticky white trim on the center console of certain models will prove polarizing for some buyers. Storage for small items is surprisingly good in this compact hatchback. If you aren't using the Qi charging pad, you can store plenty of stuff under the center stack. The center console is narrow but deep, and even the rear cupholders have decent depth. None of the door pockets are spacious. The Prius provides a generous cargo area (24.6 cubic feet), with folding rear seats for extra space. The rear seats fold flat relative to the ground, but there's a level change from the cargo load floor. We like that you can fold the rear seats without moving the front seats forward. The four lower LATCH anchors are large and easy to access, hidden thoughtfully behind leather flaps. Tethers are located halfway down the seatback, under cutouts in the seatback fabric. The tethers are impossible to access without removing the cargo cover first. The touchscreen interface is ugly and sometimes cluttered, but it's functional and easy to operate once you get used to it. Onboard navigation is included on midtier models, and while the maps are less attractive than what you'll find on your smartphone, they offer a good alternative if you're without cell service. The screen washes out in direct sunlight. The Prius offers Toyota's in-house Entune software for smartphone integration. Setup requires a lengthy app download and account creation process. Entune's app support is meager and less intuitive than CarPlay or Android Auto (neither of which are offered). The Bluetooth menu offers better control and search functionality than most other Bluetooth systems. One USB and two 12-volt outlets are your charging options. A ton of driving aids are standard, and most are available on the lowly Prius Two trim. There's even an automated parking function on high-end models. Good feature availability, and most work well. Like many competing systems, the adaptive cruise control is overly sensitive, slamming on the brakes as drivers enter your lane. Voice controls work reasonably well. There's some natural speech detection, so you don't have to follow the voice prompts religiously. You can interact with your phone's mobile assistant, but you hold the phone call button to access it, rather than the more common voice control button. Buyers looking to get the most  bang for their buck should check out the Prius  Two, which adds a rear windshield wiper and a few extra conveniences.  Toyota is also including the Safety Plus package, with more active safety  equipment such as blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, as a  no-cost add-on. Power  for all Prius trims comes from a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine and a pair of  electric motors/generators. Their combined 121 horsepower is sent through a  continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) to the front wheels.The  Prius One and Two are similarly equipped, with the One missing a few minor  features, such as a rear window wiper. Otherwise, standard feature highlights  for both include 15-inch wheels, automatic LED headlights, LED running lights  and taillights, heated mirrors, keyless entry (driver door only) and ignition,  automatic climate control, dual 4.2-inch driver information screens, adaptive  cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, cloth upholstery, a  height-adjustable driver seat, and a 60/40-split folding rear seat.Also  standard is a 6.1-inch touchscreen display, a rearview camera, Bluetooth phone  and audio connectivity, voice recognition with Siri Eyes Free, and a  six-speaker audio system with a USB port, an auxiliary audio jack and a CD  player. Standard safety features include automatic high beams, a rearview  camera, forward collision warning, forward collision mitigation with automatic  braking, and lane departure warning and intervention. The  Prius Two also currently comes with the Safety Plus package as a no-cost  add-on, which includes blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, parking  sensors and automated parking assist.The  more efficient Prius Two Eco is equipped with ultra-low-rolling resistance tires,  a lighter lithium-ion hybrid battery, an inflation kit instead of a spare tire,  and illuminated keyless entry. The rear wiper that comes standard on the Two  trims is not offered, nor is the Safety Plus package. It returns an impressive 56 mpg combined (58 city/53 highway).Inside  the Prius Three, you'll find simulated leather on the steering wheel and  armrests, white interior accents, a wireless phone charging pad, and the Toyota  Entune premium infotainment system with a 7-inch touchscreen, navigation,  satellite radio, HD radio, and access to apps such as Pandora, iHeartRadio,  OpenTable and Yelp when paired with a smartphone running the Entune app. The  Prius Four comes with automatic wipers, simulated leather upholstery with  contrasting white stitching, heated front seats, a power driver seat with  adjustable lumbar, seatback storage pockets and a rear cargo cover. Standard  equipment on the Three Touring or Four Touring includes everything from the  corresponding Three or Four, plus 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, LED  clearance lights, unique rear bumper styling, and imitation-leather upholstery  with contrasting blue stitching. Note  that the aforementioned Safety Plus package is also a no-cost add-on for the  Three and Four. The Prius Three and Four (but not the Touring versions) can  also be upgraded with the Advanced Technology package, which consists of a  sunroof and a head-up display. Finally, the Prius Four and Four Touring can be  equipped with the Premium Convenience package, which includes a 10-speaker JBL  audio system, a self-parking system and Safety Connect emergency services. The  Safety Connect system that can be added to Prius Four and Four Touring is  subscription-based (with a one-year free trial) and includes automatic  collision notification, stolen vehicle locator, and one-touch access to  roadside and emergency assistance.",

    "full_description": "For 2017, the Toyota RAV4 gains a host of driver assistance features as standard equipment, including a forward collision mitigation system, lane departure warning, automatic high beams and adaptive cruise. The range-topping Platinum trim level is new this year. The RAV4 was modestly refreshed in 2016 with updated  exterior styling and redesigned cabin, but it hasn't been fundamentally changed  under the skin since it was introduced in 2013. The segment has heated up in  recent years, though, and the RAV4's well-rounded middle-of-the-road-ness has  left an opening for the competition. There are sportier or equally versatile  choices that offer better fuel economy, but there isn't one single compact  crossover that tops all the charts, so the RAV4 is still very competitive. User-friendly and versatile, the 2017 Toyota RAV4 is  a popular compact crossover. The driving experience won't quicken your pulse,  but the RAV4's priority on cabin comfort and cargo accommodation will appeal to  family-oriented shoppers seeking day-to-day usefulness. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions,  although trim levels share many aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the 2013 Toyota RAV4 Limited (2.5L  4-cyl.; AWD; 6-speed automatic). NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current RAV4 has received some revisions,  including a cabin and styling refresh for 2016, additional features, and the  addition of the Hybrid variant and SE and Platinum trim levels. Our findings  remain broadly applicable to this year's RAV4. Acceleration from the 176-horsepower four-cylinder is about average for the crossover segment; the V6 option that was an option last year is no longer available. The engine can feel coarse at higher rpm, and noise is prevalent. At about 125 feet to stop from 60 mph, the RAV's panic-braking performance is just about average. The pedal feel in normal use, on the other hand, is better than that of most competitors. The electric power steering provides decent feel in the RAV4. Steering effort is adjustable but defaults to light. You can select Sport mode if you prefer more steering weight. Handling is a strength in AWD RAV4s. It's well balanced and predictable, making it easy to drive. The RAV's six-speed transmission provides good gear spacing, but response to requests \u2014 especially downshifts \u2014 is sluggish. It tends to hunt for the correct gear on grades. A lockable center differential and short overhangs give the RAV4 a slight edge compared to its direct rivals. But it is still a light-duty off-roader at best. The RAV's seats are not hugely supportive, but they are quite comfortable on longer trips. It's quite good, though our Limited model's 18-inch wheels and tires compromised ride quality to a small degree. Noise suppression is good in the RAV4. No potential noise source draws undue attention to itself, and it's quieter than many competitors. Most controls are well placed and easy to reach. The primary controls for the climate control and audio systems are large and obvious but have a slightly flimsy feel to them. Large, wide-opening doors make it easy to get in and out of both the front and rear seats. The RAV's cabin is large for the driver and the front passenger. Rear seat room is generous. No significant blind spots are present in the RAV4. Even rear-quarter visibility is good. The rearview camera helps. It's remarkably easy to park. The build quality is better than in the previous RAV4 but no better than that of most competitors. Compromised cupholder placement and limited small item storage leave the RAV a step behind its competitors. Class-leading cargo space and rear seats that fold nearly flat are very good. The liftover height is low. A power liftgate is rare in this segment. Like many  such compact crossovers, the 2017 Toyota RAV4 is available with all-wheel  drive. However, we give the nod to the front-wheel-drive variant unless you  live in a frequently slick region or other such limited-traction environments.  We recommend going for the XLE trim level, which offers a nice bump in  equipment (such as improved seats and dual-zone climate control) over the base LE. We also prefer the XLE's 17-inch wheels to the less forgiving 18-inch  wheels and tires found on the uplevel Limited trim.  The LE has a decent array of standard  equipment, but most shoppers will want to set their sights on the XLE and up. The XLE grants you  dual-zone climate control, improved seat contours, the\u00a0 enhanced Entune multimedia system and 17-inch  aluminum wheels. The SE is purportedly the sport-tuned  version, though in our experience the handling difference is not significant.  In the bargain, the SE comes with different exterior trim, LED headlights and  premium vinyl upholstery. Limited models  add 18-inch wheels, navigation and driver-seat memory functions, while the  range-topping Platinum trim level (new for 2017) provides yet more  amenities and unique trim.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota Camry receives a number of updates for 2010, chief among them a new 2.5-liter four-cylinder base engine that replaces the previous 2.4-liter unit and comes in two versions (the SE gets the more powerful version). Also, both the manual and automatic transmissions now have six speeds instead of five. Other changes include a restyled grille and taillights, a new optional audio system with satellite radio and Bluetooth for base and LE models, and auto up/down windows on all four doors. Finally, stability control is now standard across the model range. The 2010 Toyota Camry has all the character of a washing machine from behind the wheel, but it's a plush-riding champ on the highway, and the optional V6 is the best in the midsize sedan segment. No wonder that the Camry remains one of the top family sedans on the market. Some things don't change. Take the 2010 Toyota Camry's buttery-soft ride and roomy, serene cabin, for example, which have been endearing Camry traits since we can remember. And some things get better with age. Look at the Camry's powerful, fuel-efficient and ultra-smooth 268-horsepower V6, which is not only the best Camry V6 ever, but also the best all-around V6 in any family sedan. Unfortunately, other things can sour with time. That's where the current Camry's underwhelming interior quality comes in. Overall, though, the 2010 Camry remains one of the top choices in this competitive segment. With excellent crash test scores and comfort and refinement to spare, the Camry's got what most family-sedan shoppers want.For 2010, the Camry receives a midcycle rejuvenation. Most notably, the base four-cylinder engine increases in size from 2.4 to 2.5 liters, with a corresponding 11-hp bump (21 hp on the SE), and the manual and automatic transmissions matched to this engine are now blessed with six gears instead of five. The exterior styling has also been tweaked, boasting a new grille, larger headlights, and a revised taillight design. On the safety front, stability control is now standard across the lineup. Other notable additions include auto up/down windows all around and a new optional audio system with satellite radio and Bluetooth for the lower trim levels.The current-generation Camry's '07 debut coincided with the latest Nissan Altima's, and the new Honda Accord joined the crowd a year later. Then, in 2009, Mazda threw its hat in the ring with the upsized Mazda 6. Meanwhile, other competent midsizers like the Chevrolet Malibu and Hyundai Sonata have soldiered on as viable alternatives. And this just in -- the 2010 Ford Fusion has received a thorough going-over and looks set to seriously challenge the class leaders.In the face of such stiff competition, there have been some rumblings that Toyota's iconic family sedan is losing its edge. Judging by the Camry's so-so interior quality relative to previous generations, there might be some truth to that. In most other respects, though, the 2010 Toyota Camry is still a top contender, from its top-notch crashworthiness and plush ride to its slightly sullied but nonetheless enduring reputation for reliability. It doesn't handle nearly as well as sporty entrants like the Mazda 6 and Altima, of course, but we suspect the majority of shoppers in this segment will appreciate the Camry's ride and handling balance more than the Mazda's or the Nissan's.With so many appealing options to choose from, we strongly advise shopping around and test-driving as many models as possible. We're fans of the Camry, though. Its refined character is bound to appeal to families looking for a soothing vehicular escape from the daily grind. All Camrys are front-wheel drive, and the standard engine on base, LE and XLE trim levels is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that generates 169 hp, 11 more than the previous 2.4-liter four. The SE receives a tweaked version of the same engine that's good for 179 hp. A six-speed manual transmission is standard on all four-cylinder Camrys except for the XLE, which comes only with a six-speed automatic. For the rest of the trims, the automatic is optional. Fuel economy is estimated to be 22 mpg city/33 mpg highway with the manual, while the automatic dips to 32 mpg highway.Optional on all models except for the base Camry is a 3.5-liter V6 that cranks out 268 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed automatic is the sole transmission choice. Thus equipped, the Camry can sprint to 60 mph in a fleet 6.5 seconds, yet fuel economy remains impressive at 19 mpg city/28 highway. Every 2010 Toyota Camry comes with antilock brakes with brake assist, stability control, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and a driver knee airbag.In crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Camry earned a perfect five stars in all frontal and side impact categories. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave it the top rating of \"Good\" in its frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. The new 2.5-liter base engine and standard six-speed transmissions add splashes of zest and refinement to the Camry's tried-and-true formula, which is to provide excellent ride comfort and isolation at the expense of engaging driving dynamics. The SE supposedly ratchets up the fun in tight corners, but in reality it's just a slightly firmer version of one of the most softly sprung family sedans you can buy.For many shoppers in this segment, the Camry's cosseting suspension and cabin may be preferable to the sportier approach taken by Mazda and Nissan, but for the record, the Camry's handling dynamics are about as bland as they get. There is one unequivocally sporty element, though -- the optional turbine-smooth V6, which transforms the 2010 Toyota Camry into one of the fastest mid-priced sedans on the road while maintaining impressive fuel economy numbers. In base and LE models, the Camry's interior is straightforward and functional. Toyota's decades of experience in ergonomics shine through here -- the main controls are large and logically placed, and the wide seats easily accommodate most body types. There are plenty of storage cubbies, too. The ice-blue backlighting for the audio and climate controls may seem a bit tacky, but it does liven things up a bit. The SE adds sporty interior styling cues, while the XLE raises the bar with convincing fake wood accents and an upscale feature not typically seen in this segment -- reclining rear seats. Trunk capacity for all models is 15 cubic feet.Notably, build and materials quality aren't up to the high standard set by previous-generation Camrys. Some plastics are substandard, and panel fitments aren't uniformly precise. The Camry's interior isn't bad by any means, but it's no longer above average for this segment. The base Camry features 16-inch steel wheels, air-conditioning, auto up/down windows for all four doors, a six-speaker CD audio system with an auxiliary input jack, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, cruise control, full power accessories and a 60/40 split-folding rear seat. The Camry LE adds keyless entry and an eight-way power driver seat.The SE includes a sport-tuned suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels, and special interior and exterior styling details. The luxurious XLE reverts to the LE's softer suspension settings and 16-inch wheels while providing an upgraded JBL-branded sound system with an in-dash CD changer and satellite radio, Bluetooth phone and music connectivity, automatic dual-zone climate control, a power passenger seat, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, reclining rear seats, a moonroof, wood-tone accents and, on the V6 model, leather seating. Note that neither the SE nor the XLE offers the folding rear seat, though each has a center pass-through.Most of the XLE's upgrades are offered on the lower trim levels as options. Other major options, depending on trim level, include a sunroof, a navigation system, keyless ignition and entry and heated front seats.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota Sienna receives more standard equipment for 2006. Most importantly, the formerly optional front side-impact airbags and three-row head-protecting side curtain airbags are standard on all Siennas this year. Other changes include new seat fabric for the CE and LE trims and Optitron gauges for LE, XLE and XLE Limited models. The XLE also has dual power front seats this year, and the XLE Limited gains driver-seat memory. There's also a new power-folding rear seat option on XLE Limited 2WD models. In addition, all Siennas receive a new grille, headlamps, foglamps and taillamp clusters. Finally, revised SAE testing procedures have dropped the van's stated horsepower rating from 230 to 215. If you want luxury in your family hauler, the 2006 Toyota Sienna has your number. With tons of innovative features and even more available options, this Toyota minivan is one of our top recommendations in its segment. At the end of its model run, the first-generation Toyota Sienna (1998-2003) was showing signs of age. Compared to the competition, it was smaller and less functional on the inside, and down on power. The Odyssey had been virtually unbeatable in the minivan category since its groundbreaking 1999 redesign, and Toyota was intent on claiming a larger share of this lucrative family vehicle segment. With the introduction of the all-new 2004 Sienna, Toyota made its move. Today's Sienna is larger, more powerful and more refined than the first generation -- three attributes that help it compete against other popular minivans. With the 2004 redesign, the Sienna also picked up some key family-friendly features. One major attraction is its fold-flat third-row seat. The advantage that the Sienna has over many competitors is that its rearmost bench is a 60/40-split instead of a single piece. With both sections folded, the Sienna's cargo area is large enough to handle a sheet of plywood laid flat on the floor. The Toyota Sienna is available in either seven- or eight-passenger configuration. Eight-passenger vans get a 40/20/40 second-row bench, allowing cargo space to be configured around seated passengers. Sometimes it's the little things that make a big difference, and the Toyota minivan is full of thoughtful touches. The driver has a strategically placed mirror that, much like on a school bus, provides a clear view of the rear-seat passengers. Additionally, there are numerous storage compartments, cargo hooks and plenty of cupholders to prevent personal belongings from inadvertently traveling around the cabin. In a world full of sport-utility vehicles, minivans are still the best choice for family transportation, and the 2006 Toyota Sienna is clearly one of the category front-runners. The 2006 Toyota Sienna benefits from a smooth 3.3-liter V6 engine with 215 horsepower coupled to a five-speed automatic transmission. This refined combination results in good fuel mileage with EPA figures of 19 mpg in the city and 27 on the highway for front-drive models and 18/24 for all-wheel-drive vans. The AWD system requires no driver intervention -- if a wheel begins to slip, power is automatically transferred to the wheels with more grip. Antilock brakes are standard across the line. Stability and traction control are included on XLE Limited and AWD models, and optional on all other Siennas. Standard airbag protection includes seat-mounted side airbags for front occupants and side curtain airbags that cover all three rows. In government crash testing, the Toyota Sienna earned perfect five-star ratings for side-impact protection along with four-star ratings for frontal-impact protection. In frontal offset testing, the IIHS gave it a \"Good\" rating, the highest, and named it a \"Best Pick.\"  The V6 is quite powerful when cruising around the suburbs, and especially when merging onto the freeway. Though the ride is supremely plush, overall handling isn't quite up to the sporty level of the Odyssey. The Sienna's interior is swathed in high-quality fabric on lower trim levels and leather and faux wood on high-end models. Most controls are simple to use, and storage space is abundant. Seven-passenger vans allow owners to push the second-row captain's chairs together to create a bench seat, though the setup isn't as user-friendly as the Odyssey's. The eight-passenger version uses a 40/20/40-split bench in the second row, enabling you to pull the middle seat 13 inches closer to the front seats for easier access to a baby. The Toyota Sienna provides 149 cubic feet of cargo capacity -- second only to the Chrysler minivans. The Toyota Sienna comes in four trim levels -- CE, LE, XLE and top-of-the-line XLE Limited; CE and LE seat seven or eight. LE, XLE and XLE Limited are eligible for all-wheel drive. The CE includes ABS, a rear air conditioner, CD player, telescoping steering wheel, dual-sliding doors with power windows and keyless entry. The LE adds driver lumbar, cruise control, heated power mirrors, privacy glass, a roof rack and a fold-flat front-passenger seat -- most of this is optional on the CE. The XLE includes alloy wheels, power-sliding doors, a power liftgate, auto headlamps, tri-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable front seats and a removable center console. The XLE Limited trim level gets larger 17-inch wheels, rear disc brakes, stability control, adaptive cruise control, a moonroof, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a CD changer, a park-assist system and rear window shades. All-wheel-drive models automatically receive 17-inch wheels, run-flat tires, stability control and upgraded brakes. Options include a rear-seat entertainment system, navigation system and power-folding third-row seat.",

    "full_description": "The 2016 Toyota Highlander is essentially unchanged from last year's model. Minor upgrades include a standard towing package on all V6 models. Comfortable and pleasing to drive, the 2016 Toyota Highlander is a no-brainer pick for a three-row family crossover. It also earns our top rating.  The 2016 Toyota Highlander, which represents the third year  of the model's current generation, remains a top contender among family-friendly  crossover SUVs. For buyers repelled by minivans or those who don't need a V8-powered  toy-hauling behemoth, the three-row Highlander hits the sweet spot, offering front-  or all-wheel-drive, a choice of four-cylinder or V6 engines, and five distinct  trim levels, each with a successively longer list of features. \nRegardless of trim level, the Highlander stands out by  virtue of its spacious and comfortable cabin. Second-row seating is a choice of  three-across bench seating or captain's chairs with a side table. The refined  V6 and smooth six-speed automatic transmission deliver effortless acceleration  and make the Highlander one of the quickest big crossovers around. There are  also plenty of contemporary tech tools and smartphone-integrated services,  anchored by an 8-inch high-resolution touchscreen display in the higher trim  levels. \nFor 2016, Toyota keeps  the Highlander essentially unchanged. There's a new standard towing package  that makes all V6 models capable of towing up to 5,000 pounds (previously this  was an option).\nThe Highlander packs enough goodness that we've made it one  of our top  picks for a three-row crossover this year. But it's not the only model worth  checking out. The Highlander's main rival, the Honda Pilot, is fully  redesigned this year and is more upscale and carlike than in prior years. The Ford Explorer is also updated  this year and offers a similar range of prices and features plus a strong  turbocharged V6 option. There's also the handsome-looking Dodge  Durango or the three-row Hyundai Santa  Fe, the latter of which stacks up nicely against the Highlander across the  board. All of them are competent family vehicles, but the Highlander certainly  earns its well-deserved reputation for all-around goodness. The base Highlander LE comes standard with front-wheel drive  and a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 185 horsepower and 184 pound-feet  of torque. The only transmission is a six-speed automatic. Fuel  economy is an EPA-estimated 22 mpg combined (20 mpg city/25 mpg highway), which is barely better than the ratings for the  stronger V6 engine.\nThat 3.5-liter V6 is optional on the LE and standard on all  other trims. It's rated at 270 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. The transmission is  again a six-speed automatic and either front- or all-wheel drive is available  (Limited Platinum comes with standard AWD). The front-wheel-drive V6  configuration achieves an EPA-estimated 21 mpg combined (19 mpg city/25 mpg highway), while the AWD V6 drops a tick to 20 mpg combined (18 mpg city/24 mpg highway). We easily met these estimates when we recorded a  real-world 23 mpg on Edmunds' 120-mile mixed-driving evaluation loop in an XLE  AWD.\nAt the Edmunds test facility, we recorded a 7.3-second  0-60-mph time in that same XLE AWD, which is about a second quicker than the  average for this segment. A Limited with front-wheel drive still outpaced most  competitors with a run to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds.\nThe four-cylinder Highlander LE is rated to tow up to 1,500  pounds. All V6 models are now equipped with a standard tow package (with a  heavy-duty radiator, alternator and supplemental oil cooler) and rated to tow  up to 5,000 pounds.  The 2016 Toyota Highlander comes standard with traction and  stability control, antilock disc brakes, front seat side airbags, a driver knee  airbag, a front passenger seat-cushion airbag and full-length side curtain  airbags. A rearview camera is also standard.\nThe Limited trim gets a blind-spot monitoring system with  rear cross-traffic alert, and its optional Driver Technology package (standard  on Limited Platinum) adds a frontal collision warning and mitigation system  (with automatic braking), lane-departure warning and Toyota's Safety Connect telematics  (emergency assistance, stolen-vehicle location and automatic collision  notification). Unfortunately, these items are unavailable on lesser Highlander  trims.\nIn a simulated panic stop from 60 mph conducted at the  Edmunds test facility, a Highlander XLE AWD managed a braking distance of 116  feet, a very good distance for this class.\nIn government crash testing, the Highlander received a five-star  overall rating (out of a possible five), with four stars for total frontal  impact protection and five stars for total side impact protection. During  testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Highlander received  the highest  possible rating of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset,  side-impact and roof-strength tests. In the small-overlap frontal-offset impact  test, the Highlander received the second-highest rating of  \"Acceptable.\" Its seat and head restraint design was rated  \"Good\" for whiplash protection in rear impacts. Most 2016 Toyota Highlander buyers end up with the  tried-and-true V6 engine, and it's easy to see why: You get almost the same  fuel economy as with the base four-cylinder, along with an extra 85 hp and some  of the smoothest acceleration in any crossover at this price. The six-speed  automatic transmission works well and provides quick downshifts in most  situations.\nThe meaty three-spoke steering wheel is precise, and if you  drive quickly around a tight turn, the Highlander remains secure, with a decent  amount of grip. As long as you're not looking for athletic handling (not many  people are in this class, honestly), you'll likely find the Highlander sharp  enough. Of course, the Highlander's bread and butter is ferrying passengers  around in comfort, and it certainly excels in that regard. The cabin remains  hushed at speed, and road impacts are generally shrugged off by the compliant  suspension, though the Limited's 19-inch wheels make it feel slightly less accommodating. Hard plastics that were once the bane of the Highlander have  since been supplanted by supple surfaces with fancy stitching at the seams. The  gauge cluster has a contemporary look thanks in part to the multifunction  information display that sits in the middle (especially the XLE and Limited's  larger color version). Although the base 6.1-inch central touchscreen is a bit  basic in both form and function, the available 8-inch unit is more satisfying  with its improved graphics and functionality.\nToyota has baked a number of handy storage features into the  Highlander's interior. There's a unique built-in shelf on  the dashboard, for instance, that can serve as a resting place for phones  and other small personal items. The shelf's short height, however, can make it  hard to fit your hand in there to place or retrieve those items. Vastly more  spacious is the storage box under the console armrest that's big enough for a  large purse.\nIf you're expecting big-time space in the way back, we  should warn you that adults will still find the third row cramped relative to  some rivals. Kids will be fine, though, and the three-across seating bolsters  the Highlander's credentials as a minivan substitute. Behind that third row is  nearly 14 cubic feet of cargo-carrying capacity, which when the rear seats are  lowered maxes out at 83.7 cubic feet, an average figure for this class of  vehicle. The available height-adjustable power liftgate with memory height  settings is also a boon in garages with low ceilings.  \nThe base LE starts with 18-inch alloy wheels, automatic  headlights, heated exterior mirrors, a rear spoiler, cruise control, a rearview  camera, cloth seating, manually adjustable front seats (six-way driver,  four-way passenger), a sliding and reclining 60/40-split second-row seat, a  60/40-split third-row seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, Bluetooth  phone and audio connectivity, a 6.1-inch central touchscreen and a six-speaker  audio system with voice control, a CD player, an auxiliary audio jack and an  iPod/USB interface.\nPicking the LE Plus adds foglights, a flip-up rear hatch  window, an adjustable-height power liftgate, tri-zone automatic climate  control, upgraded upholstery with synthetic leather (SofTex) accents, an eight-way  power driver seat (with power lumbar), a leather-wrapped steering wheel,  satellite radio and HD radio, and an eight-inch display monitor. \nThe XLE further adds a sunroof, roof rails, keyless entry  and ignition, leather upholstery for the first and second rows (SofTex for the  third), heated front seats, an upgraded driver information display, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, a 110-volt power outlet in the second row,  retractable second-row sunshades, driver voice amplification for communicating  with rear passengers (Driver Easy Speak), an 8-inch central touchscreen, a  navigation system and smartphone app integration (Entune App  Suite).\nNearing the top, the Limited comes with 19-inch wheels, LED  running lights, LED ambient interior lighting, second-row captain's chairs,  heated and ventilated front seats, driver memory functions, a four-way power  passenger seat, a blind-spot monitoring system, rear cross-traffic alert, rear  parking sensors and a 12-speaker JBL  audio system.\nThere are no factory options available for the LE or LE Plus  trim levels. The XLE can be outfitted with the second-row captain's chairs. An  optional rear-seat entertainment package for the XLE and Limited includes a  Blu-ray player with 9-inch display, RCA jacks and wireless headphones.\nOn the Limited you can also select the Driver Technology  package, which fits the Highlander with automatic high-beam control headlights,  adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, frontal collision warning, a  frontal impact crash mitigation system (with automatic braking) and Toyota's  Safety Connect telematics (emergency assistance, stolen vehicle location and  automatic collision notification).\nFinally, the top-shelf Highlander Limited Platinum reaps all  of the above as standard and further includes a panoramic sunroof, rain-sensing  wipers, a heated steering wheel and heated second-row seats.",

    "full_description": "Other than the addition of the Entune infotainment system to the standard equipment list, the 2014 Toyota Sequoia is unchanged. With class-leading refinement and plenty of versatility and user-friendly features, the 2014 Toyota Sequoia is our top pick among traditional full-size SUVs. If your needs are less extreme, though, a large, three-row crossover will likely serve you better. In  today's world, it's hard to deny the appeal of crossover SUVs. Compared to traditional  full-size SUVs like the 2014 Toyota Sequoia, they offer superior fuel economy  and a more pleasant on-road demeanor. Yet there's still a small population of  buyers who truly need the combination of towing muscle and seating capacity that  only an old-school SUV can provide. If you're one of them, you'll find few  truck-based SUVs that can match the Toyota Sequoia's impressive package of power  and refinement.\nBuilt  on a modified version of Toyota's Tundra  pickup platform, the eight-passenger Sequoia has the performance side covered  with its 381-horsepower 5.7-liter V8. This is an uncommonly smooth engine that  delivers robust acceleration in weekday driving and still has the brawn to tow  trailers up to 7,400 pounds on the weekend. The Sequoia offers decent handling  and good ride comfort, too. Inside, you'll find a spacious and comfortable  cabin with flexible seating and room for as many as eight passengers. Base  models come pretty well equipped, while higher trim levels offer standard  features on par with upscale luxury sedans.\nOf  course, if you don't really need the 2014 Sequoia's towing capabilities, you'll  find that lighter-duty, three-row crossover SUVs are easier to live with day to  day and more fuel-efficient. Top alternatives include the roomy 2014 Chevrolet Traverse or the more  tow-capable (but smaller) Dodge Durango. As for traditional, full-size SUVs,  the Chevrolet Tahoe/Suburban and Ford Expedition have their own appeal, though  neither offers quite as likable a package as the Sequoia. Even though it's  clearly not right for everybody, the 2014 Toyota Sequoia still remains our top recommendation  to shoppers who have a legitimate need for a vehicle that can seat a small  crowd, tow a big trailer, or even do both at once. The  2014 Toyota Sequoia comes standard with a 5.7-liter V8 engine rated at 381 hp  and 401 pound-feet of torque. The V8 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission, and rear-wheel drive is standard. A four-wheel-drive system with  low-range gearing is available as an option.\nIn  Edmunds performance testing, a Sequoia hustled from zero to 60 mph in a quick  6.7 seconds. As is typical for a full-size, truck-based SUV, EPA-estimated fuel  economy is low at 15 mpg  combined (13 mpg city/17 mpg highway) with rear-wheel drive, and 14 mpg combined (13 mpg city/17 mpg highway) with 4WD.\nTwo-wheel-drive  Sequoias can tow a maximum of 7,400 pounds. You can expect a slightly lower tow  rating if you choose a Sequoia with 4WD or a high level of equipment. Standard  safety equipment for all 2014 Toyota Sequoia models includes antilock disc  brakes, stability control, traction control, trailer sway control, front knee  airbags, front-seat side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags. Front and  rear parking sensors and a rearview camera are standard on Limited and Platinum  trim levels; a camera is optional on the SR5. A blind-spot monitoring system is  standard on the Platinum.\nAlthough  the Sequoia's brake pedal has an overly soft and long action to it, its actual  stopping performance is quite good for a large SUV. In Edmunds brake testing,  the Sequoia needed just 127 feet to come to a stop from 60 mph, a short  distance for this class. The  highlight of driving any 2014 Toyota Sequoia is the 5.7-liter V8. This engine  is gutsy and provides impressive acceleration, even in this large, heavy  vehicle. The six-speed automatic transmission also performs flawlessly, with  smooth, predictable shifts in everyday driving.\nAlthough  the 2014 Toyota Sequoia feels less unwieldy than many of its heavyweight competitors,  there's no getting around its supersize dimensions and challenging outward  visibility. Maneuvering in tight confines like parking garages can be a hassle,  and the available front and rear parking sensors and rearview camera are well  worth the expense. The Sequoia's ride quality is quite good, however, especially  on Platinum models with the adaptive air suspension. Inside  the 2014 Toyota Sequoia you'll find a spacious and comfortable cabin with room  for as many as eight passengers. Models fitted with the available second-row  captain's chairs have a bit more of a deluxe feel, but it's hard to find fault  with the standard 40/20/40 split bench. Its individual sections can be reclined,  adjusted farther back for greater comfort or scooted forward to keep youngsters  close at hand.\nThe  quality of both the materials and construction is above average, creating a  pleasant environment that belies the Sequoia's rugged truck-based origins.  Gauges and controls are generally well placed and easy to use, with the  exception of the audio controls that require a bit of a reach for some drivers.  Also, getting started with Entune can be a  hassle since you have to install an app on your phone and register for an  account; plus, you always need an active data connection to use it. The  touchscreen interface has straightforward menus, but it's sometimes  unresponsive to touch inputs.\nWhen  it comes time to schlepp cargo, the Sequoia shines with a healthy 66.6 cubic  feet of space behind the second-row seats. Fold both the second and third rows  down and you open up a cavernous 120-cubic-foot cargo hold. The third-row seats  fold down into the floor, a much more practical design than that found in GM's  full-size SUVs, which still require you to remove and store the heavy seat  sections. \nThe  entry-level SR5 model comes with a long list of standard features, including  18-inch alloy wheels, foglights, heated mirrors, keyless entry, a roof rack,  running boards, rear privacy glass, a power-down rear window and towing preparation.  That list continues inside with tri-zone automatic climate control, power front  seats (eight-way driver, four-way passenger), a 40/20/40-split second-row bench  seat (with sliding and reclining functionality), a 60/40-split reclining and  fold-flat third-row bench, cruise control, a leather-wrapped  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, Bluetooth phone and  audio connectivity, and an eight-speaker audio system with a CD player,  satellite radio, HD radio, an auxiliary audio input and a USB/iPod interface.  New this year is Toyota's Entune system, which connects to the driver's smartphone and makes it possible to  access various entertainment and information apps via a standard 6.1-inch  touchscreen.\nOptions  for the SR5 include a Sport package with 20-inch chrome-clad alloy wheels, a  color-keyed grille and second-row captain's chairs. The available Premium  package bundles leather upholstery, a 10-way power-adjustable driver seat,  heated front seats, a power-reclining and -folding third-row seat, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror and a rearview camera (display built into the rearview mirror).\nStepping  up to the Limited model gets you 20-inch alloy wheels, power-folding and  auto-dimming outside mirrors, a sunroof, front and rear parking sensors and a  power liftgate. Inside, everything from the SR5's Premium package is included  as standard, along with side-window sunshades for the second and third rows,  upgraded gauges and a navigation system. A 14-speaker JBL sound system is optional, as is a rear-seat entertainment system with a Blu-Ray player.\nThe  top-of-the-line Platinum trim level comes standard with all the above features,  plus 20-inch chrome-clad alloy wheels, an adaptive air suspension (with a load-leveling  rear), blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, perforated leather upholstery,  heated and ventilated front seats, a 12-way power driver seat, driver memory  functions, heated second-row captain's chairs and a power-adjustable steering  wheel.",

With its recently improved cabin quality and handling, the 2016 Toyota Camry is a compelling and competitive midsize sedan. The balancing act continues for the 2016 Toyota Camry, a  perennial best-seller that's trying to move forward without abandoning its roots.

At the same time, the Camry faithful demand  traditional traits like an ergonomic control layout and a hushed, buttery ride.  Serving these two masters will be a key to the Camry's ongoing success.\nTo sustain the momentum from last year's redesign, Toyota has introduced a Special Edition trim  level for 2016. Based on the sporty Camry SE, the four-cylinder-only Special  Edition ups the edginess quotient with flashy 18-inch wheels, smoked  taillights, the SE's sport-tuned suspension and vibrant blue interior trim. But  the company knows that not everyone wants tuner-inspired performance and  styling flourishes, which is where the relatively staid LE and XLE trims come  in. Outfitted with more conservative bodywork, a comfort-biased suspension and  restrained interior decor, these Camry variants should reassure longtime fans that  Toyota hasn't lost touch with its base.\nThere's a plethora of intriguing alternatives in this  segment. On the athletic end of the spectrum, the Ford Fusion and Mazda 6 deliver still more  smiles per mile without scrimping on fuel economy or features. The refreshed Honda  Accord is a superb all-around choice, while the Hyundai Sonata is value-packed  and more sophisticated than ever. But with its distinct sport- and  comfort-oriented model lines, the Camry just might come the closest to being  everything to everyone. Whether you're looking for the tried-and-true or the  cutting edge, you owe yourself a drive in the Edmunds  \"A\" rated 2016 Toyota Camry. Every 2016 Toyota Camry trim comes standard with front-wheel  drive, a six-speed automatic transmission and a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine  that produces 178 horsepower and 170 pound-feet of torque.\nIn Edmunds testing, a Camry LE with that powertrain went  from zero to 60 mph in 8.3 seconds, which is average for a four-cylinder  midsize sedan.\nThe XSE and XLE trims also offer a 3.5-liter V6 rated at 268  hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. An XLE V6 sprinted to 60 mph in just 6.2 seconds in  our testing, a quick result for this class of vehicle with an upgraded engine.\nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the four-cylinder engine is 28 mpg combined (25 city/35 highway), a few mpg behind the four-cylinder Mazda 6 and Honda  Accord.\nThe V6's EPA-estimated fuel economy of 25 mpg combined (21/31) is about average compared to rival V6 engines. Every 2016 Toyota Camry comes standard with antilock disc  brakes, stability and traction control, front and rear side airbags, front knee  airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and a rearview camera.\nThe XSE and XLE can optionally be equipped with a blind-spot  warning system that's paired with a rear cross-traffic alert system. The  Technology package adds a lane-departure warning system and a collision mitigation  system that warns the driver of an imminent collision and automatically applies  the brakes if necessary.\nOptional only on the XLE is Safety Connect, which adds  automatic collision notification, an emergency assist button and a stolen-vehicle  locator.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, a Camry LE stopped from 60 mph in  an impressively short 116 feet. However, a pair of XLE V6 test cars stopped  from 60 mph in 127 and 129 feet, which is on the long side for this class.\nIn government crash  testing, the Camry received five  out of five stars for overall crash protection, with four stars for  frontal-impact protection and five stars for side-impact protection. The  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Camry its best possible rating  of \"Good\" in its moderate-overlap and small-overlap frontal-offset  impact tests. The Camry also earned a \"Good\" score in the side-impact,  roof-strength and head restraint/seatbelts (whiplash protection) tests. Thanks to numerous improvements last year, the 2016 Toyota  Camry is more responsive to driver inputs than the previous versions, not to  mention more composed when going around corners. This is especially true of the  SE, Special Edition and XSE trims, which dial up the driver engagement even  further with their sport-tuned suspensions. If true sportiness is what you're  after, you'll still likely prefer rivals like the Ford Fusion and Mazda 6, but  Toyota has closed the gap significantly.\nOf course, the Camry has traditionally been known for its  comfort and quietness, and fortunately those traits are still abundantly  present. Even the sport-tuned trims have a supple ride, but if you want the  creamiest suspension possible, the LE and XLE certainly deliver. Under the hood,  the base four-cylinder accelerates well enough, but the optional V6 is the star  of the show with its effortless and seemingly endless thrust. Either way, the  six-speed transmission is quite refined and notably quick to downshift. The 2016 Toyota Camry provides one of the most comfortable  and spacious cabins of any midsize family sedan. There's plenty of headroom and  legroom up front and not much less in back, where even taller adults will be  content to ride for extended periods. Moreover, a rear-facing child seat will  fit in back with ease. The fixed rear headrests make it difficult to properly secure  a front-facing child seat, though. Space in the trunk, at 15.4 cubic feet, is  average for a midsize sedan.\nFrom the driver's vantage point, most of the physical buttons  are plenty large, easy to understand at a glance and glove-friendly. The  sensibly designed climate controls deserve special praise for their simple,  intuitive operation. On the technology front, the Camry gets a standard  6.1-inch version of Toyota's Entune touchscreen infotainment system, with an upgraded  7-inch touchscreen specified on multiple trim levels. The graphics aren't as  crisp as the segment's best, but like the Camry's other control interfaces,  these screens are relatively straightforward and easy to use. \nStandard equipment on the base LE includes 16-inch steel  wheels, automatic headlights, heated mirrors, air-conditioning, keyless entry,  a rearview camera, cruise control, an eight-way power driver seat (with two-way  power lumbar adjustment), 60/40-split folding rear seatbacks, cloth upholstery,  a 6.1-inch Entune touchscreen electronics interface, voice controls, Bluetooth  phone and audio connectivity, Siri Eyes Free and a six-speaker sound system  with a CD player, an auxiliary audio jack and a USB/iPod interface.\nThe SE builds on that with 17-inch alloy wheels, a  sport-tuned suspension, sport-themed exterior styling and interior trim  elements, cloth and synthetic leather upholstery, a leather-trimmed steering  wheel with paddle shifters and a 4.2-inch color driver information display.\nOptional on the LE and SE is an Entune Audio Plus package  that includes an upgraded 7-inch touchscreen, satellite radio and HD radio. A  sunroof is also optional.\nThe SE-based Special Edition trim gets the Entune Audio Plus  package and sunroof as standard, and it adds 18-inch wheels, smoked taillights,  keyless entry and ignition (including hands-free trunk opening), blue interior  trim (including seat inserts and contrast stitching), unique gauges and Qi wireless smartphone charging.\nThe XSE doesn't come standard with the sunroof, keyless  entry and ignition or the wireless phone charger, but it retains the  sport-tuned suspension and adds 18-inch wheels of its own, LED running lights,  leather and synthetic suede upholstery, heated front seats, a four-way power  passenger seat and dual-zone automatic climate control.\nA Convenience package is offered on the SE and four-cylinder  XSE trims that includes keyless entry and ignition with hands-free trunk  opening and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. \nThe XLE is equipped similarly to the XSE, but switches to the  LE's comfort-oriented suspension tuning and goes without the sporty styling  elements. It has 17-inch alloy wheels and full leather upholstery.\nThe sunroof is optional on the SE, four-cylinder XSE and four-cylinder  XLE, while the wireless smartphone charger is optional on the latter two trims.\nNote that the V6-powered versions of the XSE and XLE get a  few additional standard features, including LED headlights, a noise-reducing  windshield, the sunroof, the Convenience package, the wireless smartphone charger  and an upgraded Entune touchscreen interface with split-screen capability and smartphone  app integration. The latter is optional on all but the base LE trim, as is a  navigation system.\nOptional on the XSE and the XLE is a blind-spot monitoring  and rear cross-traffic alert system, a Technology package (lane-departure  warning, adaptive cruise control, a pre-collision warning and braking system  and automatic high-beam headlight control) and a 10-speaker JBL sound  system.\nThe XLE can additionally be equipped with Safety Connect  emergency telematics (see Safety section).",

    "full_description": "Trailer sway control is now standard on every Toyota Sequoia, while a blind-spot warning system is now included on Platinum models. With class-leading refinement, versatility and user-friendly features, the 2012 Toyota Sequoia is one of the top picks among full-size SUVs. Like the giant redwood that is its namesake, the 2012  Toyota Sequoia is big, impressive and hard to ignore. What's really surprising,  however, is just how refined this full-size truck-based SUV can be. Inside, the  Sequoia offers a huge, well-equipped cabin with comfortable seating for eight  passengers (or seven with the available second-row captain's chairs). Equally  noteworthy is the Sequoia's ride quality, which, thanks to its independent rear  suspension, is markedly better than a number of other big SUVs. This is especially  true of the Sequoia's top-of-the-line Platinum models fitted with the  three-mode \"adaptive\" suspension.\nOf course, few buy a full-size SUV primarily for  comfort. The Sequoia has the hard-working angle covered, too, with an available  381-horsepower 5.7-liter V8 engine that delivers strong acceleration and a  7,400-pound towing capacity. An available four-wheel-drive system with a  low-range transfer case and a healthy 10 inches of ground clearance also makes  this beast reasonably capable off-road. An enormous cargo bay with second- and  third-row seats that fold to create a flat load floor adds yet more  practicality.\nTruth be told, most buyers would likely be better  served by one of the impressive large car-based crossover SUVs that are easier  to drive, boast stronger fuel economy and offer similar interior  accommodations. These include the Chevrolet Traverse (or its Buick Enclave  and GMC Arcadia siblings), Ford Flex and Honda Pilot. However, should  you need the added utility and capability that only a big, truck-based SUV can  provide, then the 2012 Toyota Sequoia is in many ways the top choice when  stacked up against competitors like the Chevy Tahoe and Ford Expedition. The 2012 Toyota Sequoia is offered with one of two V8  engines. Both are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and standard rear-wheel  drive. The optional four-wheel drive features a two-speed transfer case with  electronic shifting and push-button locking.\nBase SR5 models get a 4.6-liter V8 that makes 310 hp  and 327 pound-feet of torque as standard equipment. EPA-estimated fuel economy  is 14 mpg city/20 mpg highway and 16 mpg combined with rear-wheel drive and  13/18/15 with four-wheel drive.\nThe Limited and Platinum models come with a 5.7-liter  V8 (optional on the SR5) that produces 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque. In  Edmunds performance testing, a Sequoia with this engine went from zero to 60  mph in a quick 6.7 seconds. EPA fuel economy is 13/18/15 with rear-drive and  13/17/14 with four-wheel drive. Properly equipped, a 5.7-liter two-wheel-drive  Sequoia can tow up to 7,400 pounds. Standard safety equipment for all 2012 Toyota Sequoias  includes antilock disc brakes, stability control, traction control, trailer  sway control, front-seat side-impact airbags, front knee airbags and three-row  side curtain airbags. Front and rear parking sensors and a back-up camera are  standard on Limited and Platinum trim levels. A blind spot warning system is  standard on the Platinum version.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Toyota Sequoia required  127 feet to come to a stop from 60 mph, which is a short distance for SUVs in  this class. Like an all-star NBA center, the 2012 Toyota Sequoia  moves pretty well for a vehicle its size. The 5.7-liter V8's abundance of low-end  torque makes passing maneuvers effortless, and the six-speed automatic is  always on point with gear selection, even when towing. Even the entry-level SR5  model's smaller 4.6-liter V8 is no slouch, particularly if you won't be maxing out  your SUV's payload and towing capacities on a regular basis. \nThe Sequoia's ride quality ranges from very good to  positively cushy on the Platinum model fitted with its standard adaptive  suspension set to the \"Comfort\" mode. Handling is about what you'd  expect from a vehicle this size (cumbersome) and the numb steering only  increases the sense of heft. With 10 inches of ground clearance, four-wheel-drive  models have some off-road potential, though the vehicle's sheer size makes it  better suited to rutted fire roads than gnarly trails.  The Sequoia's passenger cabin offers abundant room for  passengers, cargo or a combination of the two. Whether you opt for the eight-  or seven-passenger variations, you'll find a more comfortable and versatile cabin  than its rivals. The second-row seats in particular not only recline, but slide  fore and aft for extra legroom -- a rare feature among full-sized SUVs. The  center section of the 40/20/40-split second-row bench also slides forward to  put little ones within easy reach of mom and dad. Controls are generally easy  to use, but those for the audio system require a long reach for the driver. \nThe Sequoia's interior is well set up for carrying  stuff, with 66.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second-row seats and a  healthy 18.9 cubic feet behind the third row. While the popular Chevy Tahoe  requires you to remove and stow its heavy third-row seats in order to maximize  cargo space, the Sequoia's independent rear suspension allows its 60/40-split  third-row seats to quickly fold down into the floor to create a vast 121 cubic  feet of cargo space with all the rear seats folded. In the Limited and Platinum  models, they fold with the touch of a button. \nThe SR5 base model comes standard with 18-inch alloy  wheels, foglights, heated mirrors, a roof rack, running boards, privacy glass,  a towing package, a sunroof, keyless entry, a power vertically sliding rear  window, cruise control, tri-zone automatic climate control, power front seats (eight-way  driver, four-way passenger), a 40/20/40 sliding and reclining second-row bench  seat, 60/40-split reclining and fold-flat third-row bench, cloth upholstery, cruise  control, a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, Bluetooth phone  and audio connectivity, and an eight-speaker sound system with a CD player, satellite  radio, an auxiliary audio jack and an iPod/USB audio interface.\nThe Limited adds 20-inch alloy wheels, power-folding and  auto-dimming mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, a power liftgate, leather  upholstery, driver seat adjustable lumbar, a power reclining and folding  third-row seat, upgraded gauges, a rearview camera, rear side window sunshades  (second and third rows) and a premium 14-speaker JBL sound system with a six-CD  changer. Available options on Limited models include second-row captain's  chairs, a rear-seat entertainment system and a navigation system with a  touchscreen interface, real-time traffic info and a four-CD changer that swaps  out the six-disc.\nThose options are included on the top-of-the-line  Sequoia Platinum, which also adds 20-inch chrome-clad alloy wheels,  load-leveling rear air springs, adaptive shock absorbers, adaptive cruise  control, perforated leather upholstery, heated and cooled front seats, a 10-way  power driver seat (adds thigh adjustment), driver memory functions, a  power-adjustable steering wheel, heated second-row captain's chairs and a  four-CD changer.\nThere are only two options for SR5 models, including a  Sport Appearance package that bundles 20-inch chrome-clad alloy wheels, a  body-color grille surround and second-row captain's chairs. Its Premium package  includes many of the Limited model's extra standard features.",

    "full_description": "The 2009 Toyota 4Runner adds a new trail edition option package for enhanced off-road capabilities. For a go-anywhere traditional SUV, the 2009 Toyota 4Runner remains one of our top choices. However, those looking for an urban people carrier with little or no off-road capability may want to consider a car-based crossover SUV instead. When Toyota introduced the 4Runner in 1984, the \"SUV\" acronym was mostly unknown to the masses. Two-plus decades on, the SUV is a familiar, ever-evolving part of our automotive landscape. In the beginning, sport-utility vehicles were rugged off-road warriors designed to bust trails and scale rocky peaks. Nowadays, the SUV category offers a wide range of choices, including luxury SUVs, crossovers, mini-utes and so on. There's a sport-utility to suit nearly any taste.The 2009 Toyota 4Runner is available in several flavors with varying degrees of utility and luxury, but its foundation of off-road strength remains undiluted; the 4Runner was, after all, originally designed to bully mountain paths, and the current model stays true to those roots. Based on a body-on-frame truck chassis, its rugged underpinnings can tackle the gnarliest of backwoods ruts. Thanks to Toyota's engineering and fine-tuning, the 4Runner is also well-mannered and easy to pilot in the city and on the highway.This isn't to say that the 4Runner can match the convenience of modern crossovers. Vehicles like Toyota's own Highlander, the GMC Acadia or the Hyundai Veracruz all best the 4Runner in terms of on-road comfort, interior roominess and amenities. Meanwhile, there are still some other traditional midsize SUVs out there that are either more powerful or have had some recent updates, such as the Dodge Durango, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Nissan Pathfinder. Help is on the way, as Toyota is expected to release a redesigned 4Runner in the next model year. In the meantime, a 2009 4Runner is still a respectable choice for consumers wanting something that stays true to the original SUV formula. The 2009 Toyota 4Runner is offered with a standard 4.0-liter V6 or an optional 4.7-liter V8. Both engines are available with either rear-wheel or four-wheel drive. The V6 produces 236 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque, while the V8 churns out 260 hp and 306 lb-ft of torque. In any configuration, the power is routed through a five-speed automatic transmission. Towing capacity for V6 models is 5,000 pounds when properly equipped, while the rear-wheel-drive V8 manages 7,300 pounds when properly equipped (the four-wheel-drive V8 maxes out at 7,000 pounds). EPA fuel economy estimates place the rear-wheel-drive 4Runner V6 at 16 mpg city/21 mpg highway and 18 mpg combined. A V8 version has a 15/19/17 mpg rating, and four-wheel-drive variants get mileage that's only slightly diminished relative to this figure. Fostering occupant safety, all 2009 Toyota 4Runners come equipped with antilock disc brakes with brake assist, stability control, traction control, front-seat side airbags and roll-sensing side curtain airbags for the front seats and second-row seats. In government crash testing, the 4Runner scored four out of five stars for driver and passenger protection in frontal impacts and a perfect five out of five stars for both front and rear side-impact passenger protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded its highest rating of \"Good\" for frontal- and side-impact passenger protection. Whether you choose the V6 or the optional V8, power is plentiful -- more than enough to satisfy heavy-footed drivers. If substantial towing capability is required, opting for the V8 is a wise choice; otherwise, the more-fuel-efficient V6 will easily manage any other situation.Despite being based on a traditional truck platform, the 2009 Toyota 4Runner exhibits a very civilized, smooth and controlled ride. When fitted with the X-REAS suspension, the 4Runner delivers reasonably tight and responsive handling. Perhaps more impressive is its off-road ability, as 4WD 4Runners can overcome steep obstacles and navigate wilderness trails with relative ease. The standard Toyota 4Runner offers spacious seating for five passengers, with the ability to seat two additional passengers in the optional third-row seats. Unfortunately, the third-row seating is extremely cramped, providing barely enough legroom for children. Making things worse, the 50/50-split third row does not stow or fold flat for added cargo space. Instead, the seats must be folded to the sides or removed altogether. Even with the third row left behind, maximum cargo capacity is 75 cubic feet, which is on the small side for a midsize SUV.On the whole, the 4Runner's interior is handsomely designed with quality materials. Comments on the Limited version's accommodations are akin to those you'd hear regarding a Lexus. Dials and switches are intuitive and well-placed with the exception of the odd, joystick-like climate controls (we'd much rather have conventional knobs). Upgrading to the Sport Edition will add 17-inch wheels and Toyota's X-REAS suspension that dampens body roll and pitch, enhancing on-road handling. Also included are power front seats (V6 models) and a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with cruise and audio controls. The decidedly upscale Limited trim level goes a step further by adding illuminated running boards, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, a household-style power outlet, a leather-trimmed interior, heated front seats, driver seat memory and a six-CD changer. Most of the Sport Edition and Limited add-ons are available as options for the SR5 model.Additional 4Runner options include a voice-activated navigation system, an upgraded 10-speaker sound system, a rear-seat entertainment system, detachable personal navigation, iPod connectivity, Bluetooth hands-free, satellite radio, a sunroof, a rear spoiler, third-row seats and a two-tier cargo system. The X-REAS system is offered on the Limited as an option along with a height-adjustable rear suspension. Available in conjunction with the sport package is the urban runner package that includes many of the upmarket features and options listed above, as well as some interior and exterior accents unique to this model.New for 2009 is the trail edition package for the V6 SR5 with four-wheel drive, which adds a locking rear differential, traction control and Bilstein shocks for added off-road acumen. Also included are seats covered in a water-resistant material and other exterior and interior trim.",

    "full_description": "With  the major changes handled in last year's full redesign, the 2020 Toyota RAV4  Hybrid carries over with just a few choice refinements. Android Auto smartphone  functionality finally joins the existing Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa  systems, and that's definitely a welcome addition for Samsung, Pixel and other  non-iPhone users. Several new standard features also appear throughout the  lineup, including satellite radio (LE and XLE), a power-adjustable driver's  seat (XLE) and a premium JBL sound system (Limited).  These  minor upgrades enhance the RAV4 Hybrid's already substantial appeal. Its  comfortable and roomy cabin is solidly built and has sensibly located and  easy-to-use controls. Another bonus: The RAV4's bundle of advanced driver  safety aids \u2014 which includes adaptive cruise control, lane keeping  assist and, on everything except the base trim, blind-spot monitoring  \u2014 is something that often costs extra on many competitive SUVs. But  for most buyers, the RAV4 Hybrid's fuel efficiency is its main draw. Aside from  returning 40 mpg combined, the RAV4's battery-assisted engine generates 219  horsepower, making it the most powerful RAV4 since its V6 engine was  discontinued in 2012. The hybrid's dual-electric motor setup also turns the  RAV4 into an all-wheel-drive SUV, which should be welcome news to drivers in  wet-weather climates. For  now, Toyota has largely cornered the small hybrid SUV market. But hybrid  versions of the Honda CR-V and the new Ford Escape are coming out for 2020, and  both look promising. Drivers who don't need as much passenger or cargo space  can also consider the Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid or the Kia Niro. Still, the RAV4  looms large here, and we actually like it more than the regular RAV4. It's a  great choice for a hybrid SUV.  Reasonably  priced and equipped with a full roster of safety features, the XLE is an  undeniable bargain. But we'd try to swing the XSE if we could. It's a big price jump, but you get a full spectrum  of upgrades such as improved interior trim and an 8-inch infotainment screen to  practicalities such as a power liftgate and ambient cabin lighting. How does the RAV4 Hybrid drive? Surprisingly swift acceleration, aided by the hybrid's electric power unit, makes the RAV4 Hybrid kind of fun to drive. There's always enough power ready for lively slingshots around traffic, and straight-line sprints are equally entertaining. Our test vehicle did 0-60 mph in 7.8 seconds. That's more than one second quicker than the non-hybrid RAV4 and respectably quick for a small SUV.    Things are less amusing when stopping \u2014 the brakes feel mushy and devoid of much feedback \u2014 and the same can be said of the steering. Still, the XSE's sport-tuned suspension helps the hybrid stay planted and stable around turns. All RAV4 Hybrids have all-wheel drive. It's not meant for off-roading, but it will definitely help provide more traction on snowy and icy roads. How comfortable is the RAV4 Hybrid? The RAV4 Hybrid can cover long and short distances in pleasant comfort. The XSE trim we tested handled rough patches and bumps with ease without feeling overly firm or harsh. As for the front seats, they are nicely sculpted and padded appropriately, but the seat bottoms begin to feel flat on longer drives. The passenger side's lack of adjustment can also make it difficult to find a comfortable position.    At highway speeds, the RAV4 is generally quiet. The exception is when you hit the gas for a burst of speed, at which point the engine sound gets rather coarse. The climate control system regulates temps quickly and distributes air well throughout the cabin. How\u2019s the interior? It's easy to get in and out of the RAV4 Hybrid's front and back seats, and the roomy cabin gives four adults plenty of space to stretch out. The RAV4 doesn't feel claustrophobic, and there's good visibility in all directions. And while the rear seats are set low, the front seats are oddly high and can't be adjusted down. It can be an issue for taller drivers and front passengers.    Most controls are logically placed and easy to figure at a glance. Unfortunately, there's still a long reach to the touchscreen. The tuning knob and buttons on the passenger side of the screen require a reach to use. How\u2019s the tech? Audio and navigation controls are easy to use thanks to a large tablet-style display, but the graphics look pretty dated. The tablet is nothing fancy, but it does the job. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now standard. It's a good thing too since Toyota's native Entune software remains clunky.    Voice commands can handle basic phone, audio and navigation functions but require deliberate verbal input. It pays to spend time training the system to learn your voice \u2014 or use Siri or Google Voice instead. The inclusion of advanced driver aids as standard equipment is a huge plus. How\u2019s the storage? The RAV4's cargo hold is nearly the largest in its class, hybrid or otherwise, and the load floor is low and makes loading items easy. The battery pack doesn't consume valuable cargo space, and the RAV4 Hybrid offers the same luggage space (37.5 cubic feet) as its gas counterpart. Tie-down hooks and a 12-volt power outlet enhance the hybrid's utility.    A small center console and a handful of storage nooks offer space for most small personal items, although a nifty tray lined with rubber grip spanning the length of the dash makes a good spot to park phones and wallets. Parents with young kids will appreciate the RAV4. It's easy to locate and connect safety seats to the lower car seat anchors. Forward-facing seats and boosters fit readily, but installing a rear-facing infant seat on the passenger side will likely require scooting the front seat up. How\u2019s the fuel economy? You'll have a hard time doing better than the RAV4 Hybrid's EPA rating of 40 mpg combined (41 city/38 highway). That's not only impressive in its own right, but it's also a full 10 mpg better than non-hybrid RAV4 models. We averaged 35.2 mpg during our test, and that was when driving with an often heavy foot. Drive a bit more deliberately and 40 mpg is within realistic reach. Is the RAV4 Hybrid a good value? The RAV4 Hybrid looks and feels well-built. Nice tactile touches abound, such as rubberized grips on dials and soft landings for elbows. The optional simulated leather upholstery is soft and pliable.    The hybrid doesn't cost much more than a non-hybrid, and in return you get better power and fuel economy. It'll actually pay for itself in gas savings during your loan or lease. Toyota's traditional warranty coverage is average, but the hybrid components are covered for eight years/100,000 miles. Free scheduled maintenance for two years/25,000 miles is generous. The RAV4's most recent styling change gives it a tougher look, but there's only so much design aggression you can bake into a crossover. Much of the fun of stabbing the hybrid's throttle for a juicy burst of low-end punch is negated by its rubbery steering, numb braking and droning engine under high load.     Still, its zippy electrically assisted acceleration, taut suspension and modest off-road capability make the RAV4 Hybrid a solid all-around driver. Toyota has mostly succeeded in taking the bland out of the RAV4.",

    "full_description": "The  2020 Toyota Corolla gets a full redesign that makes it more competitive against  some very strong rivals. This time around, the Corolla sheds a lot of the  uninspired personality and lackluster materials that held back previous  generations. It now looks a lot sharper, and the interior exceeds expectations  for the class. Joining  this sedan in the lineup are Corolla Hybrid and Corolla Hatchback variants (each reviewed  separately). Whichever Corolla you go with, there are plenty of features to  make you feel like you're getting the most out of your investment. These  include advanced safety features, adaptive cruise control and Apple CarPlay on  all models. This  latest 2020 Corolla represents one of the most significant redesigns in its  long history. It's now a serious competitor against the Honda Civic and the  Mazda 3, whereas previous generations often came across as though Toyota was  simply phoning it in or relying on its reputation for reliability. If you've  been turned off by the last round of Corollas, it may be time for you to come  back. Price  is likely a critical factor if you're shopping for a Corolla, which is why we  suggest checking out the LE trim.  For the small price increase over the base L trim, you get upgrades that will  make it feel less like an econobox. If your budget can handle another $2,000,  we recommend the more powerful and sporty SE trim. How does the Corolla drive? Acceleration is a bit underwhelming for the class (0-60 mph took 8.8 seconds in our testing), which means you'll likely be flooring the pedal when getting onto highways. Passing slower traffic requires a little extra planning and a heavy foot.     We tested the Corolla XSE, which is supposed to be the sporty trim level. Alas, we quickly discovered that it's not that sporty. It leans a lot when you go around turns, and its tires don't offer much grip. But as a routine daily driver, the Corolla does just fine. How comfortable is the Corolla? The Corolla's ride quality is smooth, and the front seats are comfortable. Whether you're tall or small, there are enough adjustments and sufficient range within those adjustments to find your preferred position.    Road noise increases noticeably on coarse asphalt surfaces, and you'll hear some extra wind noise around the mirrors at highway speeds. The noise isn't offensive, and the cabin is otherwise pleasantly quiet. How\u2019s the interior? The Corolla's interior benefits from a simple layout that is easy to use. The controls are right where you want them and are logically grouped. The number of buttons is sensible, with just enough to be useful but not so many that it looks cluttered.    It's also easy to get in and out of the car. There's plenty of room for front passengers, and the driver has clear sight lines to both the front and rear. Seating for rear passengers is tighter, especially with regard to headroom. Adult occupants' heads might be close to the roof. How\u2019s the tech? Toyota's recent infotainment systems have never managed to win us over, but this latest version is a marked improvement. That said, it's still not as intuitive or visually appealing as rival systems. Thankfully, Apple CarPlay is included and is our preferred interface, both in terms of on-screen and voice commands. Sadly, Android Auto is not offered.     Many advanced safety features are included as part of the standard Toyota Safety Sense suite, and almost all are well-tuned to be as unobtrusive as possible. The lane departure warning system is the outlier, and it can be oversensitive and annoying with its frequent beeping. The adaptive cruise control is praiseworthy for its smooth braking and acceleration. How\u2019s the storage? The Corolla has a smaller-capacity trunk than its primary competition, but only by a little. And it should still be enough for typical use. Unfortunately, the rear seatbacks don't fold flat with the trunk floor, which may complicate loading longer and bulkier cargo.     Storage for personal items is also on the small side. There are just enough places for your phone and the like, but many competitors give you more. On the plus side, there seems to be ample space for infant and child seats. The clearly marked car seat anchors should help with installation. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA rating for the 2.0-liter engine and CVT automatic is 34 mpg in combined city/highway driving. That's a strong showing from what is the most powerful engine in the lineup. The less powerful 1.8-liter engine is rated at 33 mpg combined. Want more? Check out the new Corolla Hybrid. Is the Corolla a good value? The Corolla is competitive against the top entrants in the small-sedan class. The cabin is upscale and is solidly put-together. Toyota's reputation for reliability figures into most shoppers' decisions, but there are other aspects to consider. You also get two years of free scheduled maintenance, which is unusual in this class. The latest Corolla brings a fresh and modern style without unnecessary trinkets and vents. It's also more enjoyable to drive than before, but other sedans in the class are noticeably more entertaining. The overarching themes are capable and competent.",

    "full_description": "The 2007 Toyota Prius lineup gets a little racier, as Toyota adds the Prius Touring model, which has a sport-tuned suspension, 16-inch alloy wheels, foglamps, xenon headlights and a larger rear lip spoiler. The other notable change for 2007 is that the original Toyota hybrid car now comes standard with front-seat side airbags and full-length head curtain airbags. The 2007 Toyota Prius is a full-featured midsize car that just so happens to be the most fuel-efficient car on the market. The fact that this hybrid starts at $22K makes it all the more attractive. Few cars of the last decade have had the impact of the Toyota Prius hybrid. It wasn't the first hybrid vehicle to enter the U.S. market, and the first-generation Prius had a quiet reception here, as it was too small, too slow and too conservatively styled to get much attention outside the hard-core environmentalist community. In contrast, the current-generation Prius, introduced in 2004, has attained celebrity status. It's not just that it's roomier, more fuel-efficient and cleaner-burning than the original, although these are all good reasons to consider buying one. It's that this midsize hybrid hatchback looks like no other car on the market and thus allows its driver to make a personal and political statement. Add in the ability to drive a Prius solo in the carpool lane in California, its biggest market, and it's clear the 2007 Toyota Prius will continue to sell in brisk numbers.The heart of the original Toyota hybrid car is a gas-electric drivetrain the company calls Hybrid Synergy Drive. In the Toyota Prius, the setup consists of a 1.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine paired with an electric-drive motor that draws power from a nickel-metal hydride battery pack (mounted under the car's rear hatch area) -- together they make 110 hp. A second electric motor functions solely as a generator, recharging the batteries. The primary electric-drive motor can also rejuice the batteries, using energy recaptured during braking. It sounds complicated, but a simplified continuously variable transmission (CVT) deftly shuffles power between the sources, providing smooth, seamless operation from the Prius driver's point of view. The Prius' claim to fame is its ability to operate under electric power alone at low speeds, which contributes to its low fuel consumption. With a combined EPA rating of 55 mpg, this is the most fuel-efficient car on sale in the U.S. for 2007.As technologically sophisticated as the Toyota Prius is, it's a remarkably practical car to drive on a day-to-day basis. Its interior is spacious enough to accommodate a family of four in comfort, and a tight turning radius combined with light, electric-assist steering makes it extremely easy to maneuver in crowded urban areas. The one thing the Prius doesn't offer is excitement, as its frugal drivetrain and modest handling capability make it one of the most tepid midsize cars on the road. This likely explains the introduction of the '07 Prius Touring model, which should provide slightly crisper handling along with a sportier look. If you're shopping for a Prius, you should also consider the similarly priced Honda Civic Hybrid. Its acceleration is equally pokey but it has better road manners and more mainstream styling. For those who can spend a bit more, Toyota's own Camry Hybrid offers a larger interior and all the comforts of a regular Camry. If you want to wear your green commitment on your sleeve, though, there's no better choice for a hybrid car than the 2007 Toyota Prius. There is only one engine and transmission combination available on the Toyota Prius. Called Hybrid Synergy Drive, the drivetrain consists of a 1.5-liter gasoline engine and two electric motors, one of which drives the front wheels and the other of which functions solely as a generator (recharging the car's battery pack). The gas engine produces 76 horsepower and 82 pound-feet of torque, while the electric-drive motor produces the equivalent of 67 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. Net peak hp is 110, mainly because the two power sources hit their peak at different times. Regardless, power delivery is smooth and consistent from rest all the way to top speed. The Prius features an elegantly simple continuously variable \"transmission\" of sorts. Toyota calls it a \"power split device.\" It provides the ease of a conventional automatic transmission, but there are no gears to shift, drive belts, torque converter or clutch. The electric-drive motor works in concert with the gas engine and through a planetary gearset to provide seamless power and maximum efficiency at all times. Fuel mileage is rated at 60 city and 51 highway, though real-world mileage is typically in the mid 40s. Every 2007 Toyota Prius comes standard with antilock brakes with brake assist, traction control, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags. Stability control is a package option. In NHTSA crash tests, Toyota's hybrid car earned four stars out of five for driver and front-passenger protection in frontal impacts. In side-impact testing, it earned five stars for front-occupant protection and four stars for the rear. In IIHS testing, the Prius earned the top rating of \"Good\" for its protection in frontal-offset and side-impact crashes. As you'd expect, the Toyota Prius is no speed demon (zero to 60 mph in about 10.4 seconds), but when it comes to the kind of daily driving that most drivers encounter, there's more than enough power to get around. Driving a Prius takes some getting used to since it doesn't have a conventional transmission that shifts gears, but most owners grow to like the car's smooth power delivery. Cabin noise is minimal, and the suspension provides an acceptably smooth ride despite the car's weight-saving chassis components. Although the 2007 Toyota Prius would make a fine highway companion, the car really shines when driven in the city, where its light steering, tight turning radius and excellent visibility make it easy to park and maneuver through traffic. Additionally, the Prius often returns its best gas mileage in freeway gridlock, as it's able to spend more time in full-electric mode. Materials quality is solid in the Toyota Prius and the overall look is upscale, an impression aided by the car's tight fit and finish. The gauge cluster is positioned toward the center of the dashboard, but the display is clear and easy to see. The optional touchscreen navigation system features a backup camera display and can be voice-operated. Although the front seats are relatively roomy, the driving position in the Prius is somewhat awkward, as the driver seat is not height-adjustable and the steering wheel does not telescope. The backseat offers ample room for adults and rear-facing infant seats, while the 14.4-cubic-foot rear hatch can accommodate a week's worth of groceries or a double stroller. Options are grouped in packages and include leather seating, an MP3 player input jack and a nine-speaker JBL audio system with an in-dash CD changer, a DVD-based navigation system, a rear backup camera and Bluetooth wireless technology. The available Smart Key system allows you to lock/unlock the doors and start the car with the key safely in your pocket or purse. Any Prius equipped with the nav system has a voice-command system that covers everything from temperature adjustment to Bluetooth cell phone dialing.",

    "full_description": "The 2009 Toyota Venza is an all-new crossover wagon based on the Camry sedan. The 2009 Toyota Venza is a new breed of vehicle, mixing crossover SUV attributes with a wagon. We think many families will find it to be pleasantly useful transportation. The 2009 Toyota Venza has a certain \"what is it?\" nature to it. This five-passenger vehicle is clearly not a wagon, but it's not a crossover SUV, either. However, as with the RAV4, Highlander and Lexus RX before it, Toyota has a knack for creating desirable new types of vehicles before the public realizes they actually want them. That's called being a trendsetter. Of course, only time will tell if the Venza turns out to be the latest trend in family transportation, but it certainly seems like a strong contender.In terms of size, the Venza falls in between two mechanically related Toyota products. It is the same length as the Camry sedan, shares the Highlander crossover's width and ride height, and is 5.5 inches taller than the Camry and 4.7 inches shorter than the Highlander. Like those two vehicles, the Venza offers four- and six-cylinder engine choices. Although the V6 option is basically identical among all three, the Venza shares the Highlander's larger 2.7-liter inline-4 -- albeit with 5 fewer horsepower. In terms of interior space, the five-passenger Venza provides a bit more spread-out space (particularly for hips and shoulders) than the Camry, but it lacks the Highlander's third row. Its 70 cubic feet of maximum cargo capacity is obviously way bigger than its sedan sibling but is far short of the Highlander (it's about the same as that of the Ford Edge).One area in which the Venza stands out is in interior design and quality. It bucks the recent downward trend exhibited by Toyota products, with better materials and improved fit and finish. The nifty multi-bin center console design is unique to the Venza, as are the high-mounted console shifter and simplified climate controls.This middle ground established by the Venza is intended for Toyota customers who need more vehicle than the Camry offers but don't need as much as the Highlander. We think this is a recipe for success, and in fact, the Venza seems more desirable and better-rounded than both its siblings. Also, compared to similarly sized crossover SUVs like the Ford Edge and Nissan Murano, the less cumbersome feeling that goes along with the Venza's wagonlike lower center of gravity is much appreciated. Even if we're not quite sure how to describe what the 2009 Toyota Venza is, we can say this: It is quite good. The 2009 Toyota Venza is available with four- or six-cylinder engines, as well as front- or all-wheel drive. All feature a six-speed automatic. The 2.7-liter four-cylinder produces 182 horsepower and 182 pound-feet of torque. Estimated fuel economy with this engine and front-wheel drive is 21 mpg city/29 mpg highway (combined has not yet been released); all-wheel drive drops those numbers by 1 mpg. The 3.5-liter V6 makes 268 hp and 246 lb-ft of torque. Its fuel economy with front-wheel drive is an EPA-estimated 19 city/26 highway and 22 combined. Once again, all-wheel drive produces a 1-mpg loss in all categories. Each 2009 Venza comes standard with four-wheel antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag and front-seat active head restraints. It shouldn't come as a shock that the 2009 Toyota Venza is hardly a wagon in the ilk of sporty European models. Instead, like the Camry on which it is based, the Venza is designed for comfort and ease of driving. Unlike the Camry, however, this crossover wagon gives the impression of being robust, with a more solid feel over bumps. The electric power steering also provides a bit more feedback than its sedan cousin, but it still feels pretty disconnected from the front wheels. Parking lot maneuvers couldn't be easier for a vehicle of this size, however. Both engines provide ample power to move this sizable wagon, although the V6 is obviously the way to go if passing folks on the highway takes precedence over achieving the best fuel economy. While other recent Toyota products have disappointed us in their build and materials quality, the 2009 Venza manages to avoid these problems. The front cabin's sleek center console is important to note, as its high-mounted shifter located next to the climate controls frees up space between the seats for a large bin covered by cupholders and a smaller bin designed for iPods and other small devices. There's another compartment designed specifically to hold Blackberrys, other PDAs and MP3 players. The audio and climate controls are a new design for Toyota, but they remain user-friendly. A high-mounted LCD screen shows trip computer and climate control information along with the optional back-up camera display.Although it lacks a third-row seat, the Venza provides loads of passenger space -- particularly in the rear, which features a reclining seatback. A bit more driver seat adjustment would be nice, though. The trunk can swallow 70 cubic feet of stuff with the rear seat folded, while boasting 34.4 cubes with the seats up (both numbers are a smidgen more than those of the Ford Edge and just a bit less than a RAV4). The availability of Toyota options and packages often depends on region, so check with your local dealer to determine what is offered in your area. Nevertheless, options on the Venza (mostly grouped into packages) include a power tailgate, a rearview camera, a sunroof, keyless ignition and entry, HID headlamps, a power passenger seat, leather upholstery and steering wheel, wood trim, heated front seats, heated mirrors and a windshield wiper de-icer. A 13-speaker surround sound audio system with Bluetooth and satellite radio is also available. It can be ordered separately or bundled with the optional voice-activated touchscreen navigation system or the rear-seat DVD entertainment system.",

    "full_description": "You  have more choices than ever for a three-row midsize SUV. But what if you want  one that gets great fuel economy too? Well, the redesigned 2020 Toyota  Highlander Hybrid could very well be just what you're looking for. \nFor  2020, the Highlander Hybrid gets a new 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that  replaces last year's V6. While this new four-cylinder hybrid system generates  roughly 60 fewer horsepower than the previous Highlander Hybrid, fuel economy  improves by 7-8 mpg in mixed driving. A newly available front-wheel-drive  configuration adds to the potential fuel savings. \nElsewhere,  the Highlander Hybrid isn't significantly different from the previous model.  While the new Highlander is a couple inches longer, the extra room has all gone  to increase cargo capacity. Passenger room is largely unchanged for 2020,  meaning there's good legroom in the first and second rows but not so much for  the third row. \nOverall,  we're pleased with the 2020 Toyota Highlander Hybrid. You can read more of our  evaluation in our in-depth Expert Rating. We  are torn between the LE and the Limited. The LE is great because it has a ton of features at a reasonable price.  Before you get to the Limited, there's the XLE. It doesn't cost much more than  the LE, but it doesn't add many quality-of-life improvements either. If you  want a Highlander Hybrid with upgrades, we suggest jumping right to the Limited, which adds leather, heated and  ventilated front seats, and parking sensors among other items. How does the Highlander Hybrid drive? The three-row Highlander has the same hybrid powertrain as the RAV4 Hybrid, though Toyota juiced it up a bit to handle the added weight. Our test Highlander accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 8.2 seconds. That's certainly respectable considering some SUVs with V6s take as much time and are far less fuel-efficient. Emergency braking power is also on par. \n\n   Around turns, this hybrid is surprisingly composed. The Highlander Hybrid isn't as athletic as the hybrid version of the Ford Explorer, but handling isn't usually a strong selling point for three-row SUVs. What's more important is ease of driving, and the Highlander Hybrid nails it. Power is readily available and smoothly delivered, and the brakes are smooth and don't exhibit the grabbiness found in some other hybrids. How comfortable is the Highlander Hybrid? The Highlander Hybrid's ride quality is plush. It smooths over most road imperfections yet remains controlled without much float at higher speeds. The wide front seats are pretty comfortable even on long drives, and the available second-row captain's chairs deliver nearly the same level of comfort. Alas, the third-row seats remain one of the Highlander's greatest liabilities. Thin padding, a very low seat cushion and limited legroom make them ill-suited for most adults.\n\n   We like the Highlander's excellent climate control system. It's easy to use and can quickly heat or cool the cabin. At highway speeds, the Highlander is nicely insulated from wind and road noise. The gas engine sounds unrefined when you go full throttle, but otherwise it's noninvasive. How\u2019s the interior? The first and second seating rows provide ample space. Unfortunately, the Highlander's third row is one of the most confining by midsize three-row SUV standards. If you're planning on regularly using the full passenger capacity, be sure it meets your needs first. \n\n   Adjusting the driver's seat is quick and easy, and there's ample range of adjustment. Tall drivers will likely want the steering wheel to telescope out a little more. Outward visibility, especially for a vehicle this size, is great. The windshield roof pillars are thin, which help you see around turns or in tight parking situations. \n\n   The Platinum trim, which is what we tested, also comes with some very useful features such as a camera-based rearview mirror that allows you to see out of the back even if you've fully loaded up the rear cargo area. There's also an available surround-view camera system. It has sharp resolution and can be rotated to look around the vehicle. How\u2019s the tech? In recent years, Toyota has trailed other manufacturers when it comes to tech. This new Highlander Hybrid makes big strides in the right direction, but it still has some minor drawbacks. The optional 12.3-in touchscreen is huge (an 8-inch screen is standard) and it responds quickly to inputs. But its high-gloss surface makes it prone to reflections and smudges. Our Highlander Hybrid Platinum tester had five USB charge ports for the first and second rows but none for the third row.\n\n   All Highlanders come standard with a comprehensive suite of advanced driver aids. We like the natural operation of the adaptive cruise control, but we found the lane departure warning slightly too sensitive and the lane-centering ineffective at highway speeds. How\u2019s the storage? Cargo space is a bit of a mixed bag with the Highlander Hybrid. Behind the third row, there's only 16 cubic feet of space, which is a bit less than what the Ford Explorer provides. Behind the second row, it expands to a better-than-average 48.4 cubic feet. The liftover height is about average for a midsize SUV. \n\n   There's decent space for your things, with a few useful shelves across the dash. If you have a phone charging on the wireless pad in the center bin, you have to remove it to access the space beneath. We didn't find it that cumbersome, but you might. \n\n   Got small children? You can easily install a large rear-facing car seat in the second row thanks to the generous amount of fore-and-aft movement of the available captain's chairs. The car seat anchors are also easy to locate and access for all types of seats, though there are no anchors in the third row. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The top trims for the all-wheel-drive Highlander Hybrid get an EPA-estimated 35 mpg combined. Front-wheel-drive versions are a little more efficient at 36 mpg combined.\n\n   On our relatively traffic-free evaluation route, we traveled 115 miles at an efficiency of 33 mpg. That's really good for a big three-row SUV, though it's obviously slightly below the EPA estimates. It's still significantly more efficient than the Ford Explorer Hybrid we tested (EPA estimate: 25 mpg combined), which returned 23.3 mpg on average. Is the Highlander Hybrid a good value? There's only one other non-luxury three-row SUV hybrid currently out: the Ford Explorer. Compared to the Ford, the Highlander's cost of entry is tens of thousands less. Even top trim for top trim, the Platinum Highlander is a better deal, not to mention far more fuel-efficient. The Highlander's interior is solidly put together with soft, padded surfaces where they matter most. Toyota's hybrids have a track record for running long and strong, so odds are high this Highlander will serve you loyally.\n\n   Toyota's warranty coverage is pretty common for the class with three years/36,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage and five years/60,000 miles for the powertrain. Hybrid components are covered for eight years/100,000 miles and Toyota has extended its hybrid battery coverage for 2020 model year vehicles to a generous 10 years/150,000 miles. The first two years of scheduled maintenance are also free. The Highlander Hybrid isn't something we'd choose for a winding road but it's no less composed than the lighter, non-hybrid version of itself. It's something you'd look forward to taking a long trip in, though, and some might consider that fun.\n\n   The Highlander's new styling gives it a more aggressive vibe overall, but we're not sold on the bold details traveling down the side of the car. To us it looks overdone, but to each their own.",

    "full_description": "There are some very minor changes for 2017, such as power actuation of the crew cab's sliding rear window. But there is one major change to the lineup: the range-topping TRD Pro trim level returns after a one-year absence. Ever  the sales leader in the midsize segment, the Tacoma trades heavily on Toyota's  well-deserved reputation for building small trucks with superior off-highway  capability and rugged dependability. Able to do much more than haul building  materials from the home improvement store (which it does quite well), the  Tacoma gives off an off-road lifestyle vibe that it can back up with actual  performance.  You can see it in the truck's stance, its ground  clearance and the cut of its front bumper. And frankly you'll also notice it  when you hoist yourself up into the cab, which is handsome and functional  enough but has an odd driving position born of the need for maximum underbody  clearance. The story is the same whether you buy a 4x2 or a 4x4 because in 2016  all two-wheel-drive Tacomas adopted the jacked-up stance of their  four-wheel-drive brethren.  We're not bowled over by the lack of response and  sometimes awkward drivability of its V6 engine, but the real culprit is likely  a shift program for the six-speed automatic that's designed to extract maximum  fuel mileage. Still, it gets the job done, and when the road turns to dirt, the  suspension, tires and traction management systems take over the lead role.  Two of the available six models are bristling with  off-road gear that further extends their appeal and capability. The TRD  Off-Road has knobby tires, special shocks and traction aids such as a locking  rear differential, crawl control and an advanced multimode off-road traction  control system. The reintroduced-for-2017 TRD Pro has all of that plus extra  suspension travel, a taller and wider stance, and trick big-bore Fox internal  bypass shocks, all of which allow it to soak up even more high-speed punishment  while still delivering a smooth ride on the pavement.\nWhat's it like to live with?\nThe Edmunds editorial team purchased a 2016 Toyota Tacoma  TRD Off Road and lived with it for nearly two years, logging more than 40,000  miles. We drove it every day, took it on long road trips, and tested it in the  harshest of off-road environments. For 2017, the Tacoma gained another  off-road-ready trim level, the TRD Pro, but it's the same generation truck, so  most of our observations still apply. To learn more about the Toyota Tacoma,  check out all the details in our long-term test. The 2017 Tacoma lives up to Toyota's long-standing reputation for building small trucks that are rugged and have go-anywhere capability. A well-mannered chassis and an attractive interior make it a good daily driver, and it has the off-road clearance and hardware that make it virtually unstoppable in the dirt. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road Crew Cab  4x4 (3.5L V6; 6-speed automatic). NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Toyota Tacoma has received some very  minor equipment revisions, such as the power actuation of the sliding rear  window. The TRD Pro is all new, but it is a low-volume model that is not part  of this evaluation. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's  Toyota Tacoma. The new 3.5-liter V6 makes 42 horsepower more than the old 4.0-liter V6, but acceleration is no better because of fuel efficiency priorities. Our test truck accelerated to 60 mph in 8.1 seconds, which is adequate for its intended mission, but not class-leading. Dependable stops are straight and true. In a panic the Tacoma will stop from 60 mph in 124 feet, which is good considering the soft off-road tires. But in normal driving the brakes tend toward touchy and overeager, making it hard to execute smooth stops. Our Tacoma's steering always comes across as predictable and reassuring, with smooth and progressive effort as you guide it through corners. And it feels steady and connected when cruising straight, too. The chunky leather-wrapped steering wheel feels solid in your hands. Body roll is gradual and restrained, and the Tacoma imparts a good sense of overall competence and coordination on the sorts of winding roads you inevitably need to traverse on the way to the campground, ski lodge or trailhead. It feels equally secure and sure-footed out on the trail, too. The new six-speed automatic shifts smoothly, but fuel efficiency-biased programming makes it reluctant to downshift. There is an ECT Power button that alters the shift points for more immediate response, but it must be reselected every time you restart the truck. A six-speed manual is available. All 4x4 versions of the Tacoma do very well, but the TRD Off-Road has the suspension, tires and abundant clearance to go places other pickups, including other volume-selling midsize truck models, cannot. The locking differential, terrain select and crawl control systems are real advantages. The seats feel comfortable and supportive even though their adjustments are quite simple. Very tall drivers may wish for more thigh support because of the unusual driving position. Heated seats are optional on the TRD Off-Road and TRD Sport but standard on higher trims. The ride is notably smoother and less busy than in past years. Bilstein shocks and tall sidewalls of the 16-inch TRD Off-Road tires are adept at filtering out small road flaws, better in some circumstances than the Limited's 18-inch tires. Still, any blindfolded passenger will know this is a pickup. The new cabin feels fairly tight, with lower levels of wind and road noise compared to past years. Mechanical engine noise is nicely muted, too, and there's less exhaust drone than the old 4.0-liter V6 produced. Not hushed like a sedan, but nevertheless a pleasant place to pass the miles. The standard system is very straightforward and easy to operate, with prominent controls that need no explanation. Airflow is good through the nice-sized vents. An optional automatic climate control system is available. All switchgear is exceptionally easy to reach, understand and use, and that includes the automatic climate control, the 4x4 selector switch, the crawl control system and the multiterrain selector, which are all operated via knobs. The Tacoma has a high cabin floor that is an outgrowth of its off-road design philosophy, which demands generous ground clearance. This makes step-in notably higher than in trucks such as the Colorado, and the legs-out seating position reduces step-out leverage somewhat. The Tacoma's high floor produces a legs-out driving posture that is more carlike than you might expect. Taller drivers tend to notice this because the telescoping steering wheel doesn't have enough adjustment range, forcing them to scoot closer with knees bent more than they would otherwise. There's plenty of personal space in the Tacoma, but the front seat headroom isn't generous. You've got to be taller than average to notice, and if that is the case you may want to think twice about that sunroof. The crew-cab backseat is tighter than the Chevy Colorado's but has more toe space. There's a clear view out in all directions, and the high seating position makes it easy to spot the front corners. The crew cab's rear windows are large, and the mirrors are good-sized. The standard backup camera is a further plus. Fully redesigned in 2016, the attractive new interior features a higher grade of materials than in past years, and they generally look less like hard plastic than the competition. Numerous trips off-road failed to reveal any squeaks or rattles. Four cupholders reside between the front seats, and they can also hold small items. The shelf ahead of them is meant for phones, and in some trims it's a wireless charging pad. Glovebox, center console box and door pockets are decent-sized. The rear seatbacks fold forward to reveal concealed bins. Crew cab's rear seats fold to create a flat platform that can hold more cargo than a Colorado. Standard composite bed needs no bedliner, has rails with movable tie-down cleats, a 400-watt power outlet, LED lighting and storage bins. Removable tailgate is damped so it won't slam when dropped open. The crew cab has two pairs of LATCH lower anchors and a trio of upper tethers. The former are recessed between the cushions, and the latter must be accessed by folding the rear seatback forward, which is a bit of a pain. Bulky rear-facing seats force the corresponding front seat to be slid forward. A 4x2 V6 Tacoma can tow as much as 6,800 pounds. Our TRD Off-Road 4x4 can tow 6,400 pounds. Both are solid numbers for a midsize truck. Tow package includes hitch, wiring, extra cooling, a bigger alternator and trailer sway control. The touchscreen audio and navigation system is easier to use than many competing systems because it has simple volume and tune knobs (though they could be larger). Graphics are clear, and there isn't much glare. Sound quality isn't top-notch, but we didn't purchase the available JBL speaker upgrade. Bluetooth pairing is simple, but the USB-based smartphone interface requires you to install the Entune app on your phone to take advantage of some features. But the app is clunky to use and locks the phone for other purposes \u2014 even if it's the passenger's phone. Cabin contains just one USB jack. A blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert system is available on the TRD Sport and TRD Off-Road, and it's standard above that. Rear parking sensors are part of the bargain. Other systems are not available. Touchscreen audio system-equipped models such as our TRD Off-Road include navigation, phone and audio voice controls that do a reasonable job. Those with a paired Apple iPhone can press and hold the voice button longer to engage certain commands using the much more sophisticated Siri interface. We bought a TRD Off-Road V6 4x4 for our long-term test, and we'd do it again. With strong go-anywhere credentials thanks to its all-terrain tires, Bilstein shocks, locking rear differential and crawl control, it doesn't break the bank like the admittedly impressive TRD Pro. The cab comes equipped with the 7-inch Entune touchscreen navigation system, and a single comprehensive option package can add a tilt-and-slide moonroof, heated seats, automatic climate control, rear parking sonar, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. Available in the full range of bed, cab and transmission choices, too.  Bare-bones isn't quite the right way to describe the  low-dollar SR, the most modestly  equipped Tacoma of the lot. Even so, it can be had with an extended cab with a  6.1-foot bed or a crew cab with a 5-foot bed, and you can choose between  two-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive with a low-range transfer case.  Its 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine with 159 horsepower can be paired with a  five-speed manual or a six-speed automatic, or you can get a 278-hp 3.5-liter  V6 and the automatic.  The SR is most easily identified by its dark grille  and 16-inch steel wheels. But even this basic Tacoma comes with a sliding rear  window, a tough composite bed that needs no bedliner, a movable cleat tie-down  system and a backup camera fitted in the tailgate release handle. Inside, the  four-way cloth seats have driver-side lumbar adjustment, and the steering wheel  tilts, telescopes, and has control buttons that work with the basic Entune  stereo, which supports Bluetooth and has a USB interface. There's even a  built-in GoPro camera mount at the upper edge of the windshield. Cruise control  and remote keyless entry are available as a package option, and the SR is the  only model where you can delete the extended cab's rear seat if all you really  want is a work truck. For most buyers, the SR5 is the most common starting point. Engine choices remain the  same, but the six-speed automatic is standard. In addition to the previous  configurations mentioned, you can also get a long-wheelbase version that pairs  the crew cab with the 6.1-foot bed. Outwardly, the SR5 gains a chrome rear bumper and a  flash of chrome on its charcoal-colored grille. It's got foglights set into its  front bumper, and the 16-inch steel wheels can be upgraded to alloys. Remote  keyless entry and cruise control become standard, its steering wheel is wrapped  in leather, and the sliding rear window uses privacy glass. There's a 4.2-inch  information screen between the gauges, and the enhanced Entune audio system  supports satellite radio, smartphone-enabled navigation via the Scout GPS app  and Siri Eyes Free voice control. Next up is the TRD  Sport. It is offered in the same cab and bed configurations as the SR5, but  the V6 is the only engine. All two-wheel-drive versions use the six-speed  automatic, but four-wheel-drive buyers can choose between the automatic and a  performance-oriented six-speed manual.  It comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, body-color  fender flares and rear bumper, turn signals in the mirror housings and,  everyone's favorite, a hood scoop. There's a 400-watt power outlet in the bed  and the crew cab's sliding rear window is power-actuated. Automatic  transmission-equipped trucks gain smart entry and pushbutton start, and all TRD  Sports make the jump to full navigation via the Entune premium audio system's  7-inch touchscreen. The TRD  Off-Road offers the same configuration and engine options as the TRD Sport,  and its truck bed and interior and audio trimmings are identical. Visual  differences include a chrome rear bumper, textured black fender flares and the  absence of the Sport's hood scoop. Off-road performance changes loom large in  this trim, and these include knobby all-terrain tires on 16-inch alloy wheels,  the deletion of the front air dam, extra skid plates, a lockable rear  differential, Bilstein monotube shocks, and an advanced off-road traction  control system with multiple terrain settings and crawl control. Both the TRD Sport and TRD Off-Road can be upgraded  with an option package that includes a sunroof, automatic climate control,  heated seats and a blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. Another  version of this package also includes a JBL speaker upgrade and a subwoofer. The Limited is the most civilized version of the Tacoma. It is only offered as a V6-powered  crew cab with the short bed in either two- or four-wheel drive. It has  body-color flares and rear bumper, and it rolls on 18-inch wheels with  lower-profile tires. It lacks the TRD Off-Road's specialized off-road upgrades  and is instead upgraded with leather-trimmed seats and all the equipment found  in the JBL version of the TRD Sport and Off-Road upgrade package. The TRD Pro is sold only as a crew cab with a short bed, and it comes only in four-wheel  drive. The V6 engine is standard, but you can choose between the manual and the  automatic transmission. It sets itself apart with a black throwback grille with  \"Toyota\" spelled out in capital letters, black head- and taillight  bezels, black textured fender flares and LED foglights. It rides on the same  16-inch knobby tires as the TRD Off Road, but the Pro's unique black wheels and  vastly more capable 2.5-inch Fox internal bypass shocks give it a tougher  stance that's an inch broader and an inch taller. After that it's a mix of all  of the others: the hood scoop from the Sport, traction management features from  the TRD Off-Road, and luxury interior appointments and safety systems from the  Limited. In fact, its heated leather seats go the Limited's one better because  of their textured pattern, contrasting red stitching and logo-emblazoned  headrests. There's a unique TRD shift knob and exhaust tip, too.",

    "full_description": "If  you believe that there are multiple timelines, and in each there exists an  alternative universe to this one, then perhaps in one of those timelines using  hydrogen to power an electric motor is as commonplace as gasoline engines are  here. For us, the 2021 Toyota Mirai is sci-fi stuff \u2014 a car that uses  compressed hydrogen gas to create electricity and emit only water as you drive  quietly to your destination. It feels like an escapee from one of those  alternate universes where hydrogen stations are commonplace and the landscapes  are well watered by automotive emissions.  \nWhile  the first-generation Mirai was an interesting \u2014 albeit quirky-looking  \u2014 front-wheel-drive sedan, the redesigned Mirai features  rear-wheel-drive underpinnings and a stylish new exterior. The cabin undergoes  a thorough rethink as well, with luxurious materials throughout and seating for  five. \nThe  Mirai may pack a lab's worth of chemistry under its hood, but it doesn't drive  like an experiment. Since the wheels are driven by an electric motor, the Mirai  feels like any other EV. Hitting the accelerator delivers immediate and  adequate forward momentum, but nothing that's going to put a dent in the faux  leather headrest. There's also no noticeable transition from when the battery  power gives way to fuel-cell cruising. Fully fueled with hydrogen, the Mirai  can travel up to an EPA-estimated 402 miles. That easily outclasses most  battery electric vehicles on the market. Refueling with hydrogen is much  quicker than recharging too. \nHowever,  it's lonely to be outside your timeline. The Mirai, along with the Honda  Clarity and Hyundai Nexo, can only be fueled at hydrogen fueling stations,  which are few and far between. (At the time of our review's publication there  were just 49 public stations in California and one in Oahu, Hawaii.) Unless  these three automakers can lobby operators to increase the number of accessible  fueling stations, the Mirai's universe, even with its 400-mile range, is a  rather small one.  This  year sees the addition of the more budget-friendly XLE, which is a great choice  for those looking for a more attainable hydrogen vehicle. However, hydrogen  itself is pricey, making any Mirai an expensive proposition. With the  significant cash outlay in mind, we think it makes sense for buyers to go for  the Limited trim. If you have the  ability to trade up, its additional safety features \u2014 plus unusual  items such as ventilated rear seats and a rear control panel \u2014 are  worth the upgrade. How does the Mirai drive? Hydrogen fuel cell cars are comparatively mild when you measure them against their battery electric vehicle counterparts. The Toyota Mirai leads the fuel cell field in acceleration, needing only 8.1 seconds to reach 60 mph, but that's unremarkable by gasoline-propelled vehicle standards, and laughable by EV standards.\n\n   While the Mirai's braking performance (120 feet from 60 mph) and steering feedback are also most unremarkable, it displays surprisingly good composure turning a corner thanks to its new rear-wheel-drive layout and near 50:50 weight distribution. We wouldn't call it sporty, but the Mirai moves with a surprising amount of grace for such a heavy vehicle. And because it's an EV, there's no transmission, which means smooth, shiftless acceleration. We do wish it had stronger regenerative braking and that we could permanently select the stronger setting and not have it reset after each stop. How comfortable is the Mirai? The Mirai's best quality, by far, is its ride comfort. Underneath, the Mirai is based on the full-size Lexus LS, and though its proportions have been shortened quite a bit, it rides like a full-size Lexus. Bumps of mostly any size don't seem to faze the Mirai, and we're not quite sure how Toyota pulled that off. Couple this with a quiet cabin, as long as you don't have the synthesized Active Sound Control effects turned on, and the Mirai feels convincingly luxury-esque.\n\n   The seats, unfortunately, aren't quite as impressive. We like the soft cushioning, but the front seats in particular lack support and enough adjustments and don't seem designed to accommodate taller folks either. Our Limited trim featured heated and ventilated seats, which were relatively weak in both heating and cooling. Thankfully, the climate system is more effective (as long as it isn't in Eco mode) and is easy to use thanks to its redundant touchscreen and physical controls. How\u2019s the interior? The Mirai's size is deceiving. It's longer and wider than a Lexus midsize sedan but doesn't have as much interior passenger space, especially in the rear. It is an improvement over the previous-generation Mirai but not by huge margins. Despite the smaller-than-expected accommodations the Mirai is pretty easy to get in and out of thanks to generous door clearances. And Toyota really put special effort into making the cabin easy to see out of even if you don't spring for the Limited trim, which comes with a 360-degree bird's-eye view camera system.\n\n   The layout of all the controls and the menus within the infotainment system require some time to become familiar with. Once you're comfortable, the large configurable screen is pretty good at multitasking. How\u2019s the tech? There is a lot of \"tech\" happening behind the scenes and making the Mirai move when you press the accelerator, but that's not what we're talking about here. Powertrain aside, the Mirai shares a lot of its interior tech with the rest of the Toyota line. The native navigation system is easy to use, but it's nothing special. The same can be said of the premium JBL sound system found in the Limited trim.\n\n   The Mirai comes with wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, a total of four USB charge ports (only one of which transmits data) and a wireless charging pad. The Mirai's large 12.3-inch touchscreen is never fully dedicated to smartphone projection, which, in the case of CarPlay, means the standard two rows of four icons.\n\n   We're fans of the adaptive cruise control and lane centering in the Mirai and found it useful in traffic. Without cruise control on, the lane keeping aid can feel a bit intrusive. The blind-spot monitoring was also a bit too sensitive in its detection of vehicles while you're trying to change lanes. How\u2019s the storage? If you're someone with a lot of baggage, literally speaking, or appreciate having lots of cabin storage for personal items, the Mirai is going to disappoint. The trunk holds just 9.6 cubic feet of stuff, and the Mirai doesn't have a pass-through or folding rear seatbacks to accommodate longer items. And forget about a front trunk \u2014 there's a lot of fuel cell hardware under that hood. The bad news continues into the cabin where storage is scarce and pockets are small. Hydrogen tanks require a lot of space, which means there's less of it for passengers and stuff.\n\n   Car seats are not impossible to install, but if convenience is a priority, the Mirai likely won't be a good fit. Installing a car seat in the outboard position comprises the comfort of anyone sitting in front, while having it in the middle makes loading and unloading your tiny passengers a strain on your back. Best to test your seat out before signing any paperwork. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Mirai is estimated to return 357 miles in Limited trim (64 miles per kg of hydrogen) and up to 402 miles for the entry XLE trim (72 miles/kg). That's more efficient than the Hyundai Nexo and comparable to the Honda Clarity. But the range figures seem a bit optimistic as we didn't surpass 300 miles for a tank in our regular driving during our time with our Limited test car. Hydrogen is expensive, too, and its price can fluctuate wildly. We paid $17 per kg of hydrogen, with a full tank costing nearly $90 at the time of testing. If we compare the cost of a tank of hydrogen to the current cost of a gallon of premium fuel ($5.85) and assume 300 miles of range for each vehicle, our Mirai returned about 19.5 mpg. While this isn't terrible, especially with the initial hydrogen fuel subsidy, it's definitely not nearly as cost-efficient or convenient as the least efficient battery electric vehicle. Is the Mirai a good value? A hydrogen fuel cell vehicle like the Mirai can be an excellent value for the right person. The Mirai comes with a generous fuel stipend, and the incentives and tax credits can significantly lower the cost of leasing or owning one. Toyota at one point was offering a $20,000 incentive for the Mirai, on top $15,000 worth of hydrogen fuel credit, an $8,000 federal tax credit, and for California residents, an additional $4,500 credit. But the Mirai's limited availability and the even more limited hydrogen fuel infrastructure make for a pretty unrealistic proposition for most.\n\n   However, if the stars align and a Mirai is something you're considering, things could play out nicely. The Mirai is a bit more expensive than the Hyundai Nexo and Honda Clarity, but it benefits from a more premium-looking interior and feels very well built. Warranty coverage is pretty standard, buy Toyota includes three years/35,000 miles of free maintenance and 21 days of complimentary car rentals over three years in case you need to drive somewhere where hydrogen isn't readily available (which is most places). While we commend the Mirai for its surprising composure on curvy roads, it's not a vehicle we'd drive for the sake of driving. Comfortable? Indeed. Fun to drive? Not really.\n\n   On the upside, the Mirai's styling is far less polarizing than the previous version. It's not quite attractive but it's interesting. Still, despite its amazing ride quality, we don't think there's enough intrigue here worth the hassle of putting up with a lack of hydrogen infrastructure versus charging your EV in the comfort of your own home.",

    "full_description": "The 2012 Toyota Camry is fully redesigned. Toyota has made a number of small but effective changes to the redesigned 2012 Camry. The result is that the Camry has moved back up to be a top choice for a midsize sedan. The 2012 Toyota Camry has been improved in almost every  detail, which is excellent news since the previous model was disappointing in  many regards. On the whole, this may look like the same package, but it's been massaged  and redesigned to bring it up to the standards of usability, safety and  interior construction set by the competition, and then retuned and restyled to  be a little more expressive. But as before, durability and reliability are  still the key attributes meant to set the 2012 Toyota Camry apart from its  rivals.\nYou'll notice that the new Camry offers improved versions of  last year's engines: a 178-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a 268-hp  3.5-liter V6. Both engines feature a six-speed automatic transmission to  deliver better fuel economy. The four-cylinder returns an EPA-estimated 35  highway mpg, while the V6 achieves 30 mpg on the highway. And yet, despite this  thriftiness, the Camry's engines are notably eager to deliver swift  acceleration when you need it. There's also a Camry Hybrid, covered in a  separate review.\nWithin the cabin, the front seats have been redesigned to be  more supportive and repositioned to afford more rear legroom. However, the  bigger difference inside can be seen in design and quality. The old Camry  suffered from subpar interior materials and a rather uninspired design. The new  Camry reverses this downward trend, especially in the SE and XLE trims, with  dramatically improved build quality and a pleasing selection of thoughtfully  chosen trim types, textures and materials. Meanwhile, a new, well-designed  touchscreen electronics interface and several high-tech features help set it  apart from the pack.\nToyota has also set out to address a long-running complaint  about the Camry being boring to drive. Suspension improvements have been made  to enliven the Camry's handling dynamics and make the ride more composed. It's  not entirely effective -- numb steering and a general disconnected feel make  the Camry a less desirable car to drive than most rivals. The exception to this  is the SE, which isn't so much a sport model, but rather the one that manages  to bring the Camry's driving dynamics up to par for the class.\nIn total, the Toyota Camry is once again one of the more  appealing midsize family sedans. Still, that class is better than ever and we  suggest checking out the competition thoroughly before settling on a Camry. The  Honda Accord and Mazda 6 continue to set the standard for those who want their  car to feel responsive, while the Hyundai Sonata  offers more style,  comparable refinement and stellar value. Meanwhile, the new Volkswagen Passat  is bigger and cheaper  than ever while still maintaining its European flavor. The Camry may have  corrected many of its predecessor's faults, but its improved competition means  choosing one still isn't the slam-dunk it once was. Every 2012 Toyota Camry features front-wheel drive and a  six-speed automatic transmission, but there are two engine choices. Base Camrys  are powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that produces 178 hp and 170  pound-feet of torque. In Edmunds performance testing, this engine brought the  Camry from zero to 60 mph in 8.1 seconds, which makes it one of the quickest  four-cylinder midsize sedans. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 25 mpg city/35 highway  and 28 combined, which puts the Camry among the class leaders.\nOptional is a 3.5-liter V6 that generates 268 hp and 248  lb-ft of torque. It hits 60 mph in 6.6 seconds, which is average for upgrade  engines in this class. Its fuel economy is an impressive 21/30/25. The 2012 Toyota Camry comes with a battery of standard  safety features, including antilock brakes with brake assist, stability  control, front- and rear-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags,  and knee airbags for both driver and passenger, the latter new for 2012. A  blind-spot monitoring system is also available.\nIn Edmunds braking tests, both the Camry LE and SE came to a  stop from 60 mph in about 120 feet, which is a bit better than average for the  class.\nIn government crash testing, the Camry received a top  five-star score for overall crash protection, four stars for overall frontal  protection and five stars for overall side protection. The Insurance Institute  for Highway Safety gave the Camry the best possible rating of \"Good\"  in the frontal-offset, side and roof strength tests. In terms of power, both four-cylinder and V6 engines are  pretty similar to last year's model. The 2012 Toyota Camry's new  electric-assisted steering (once limited to the hybrid) feels pretty decent in  the V6 and SE versions. But non-SE four-cylinder versions, which use an  electric-assist steering system from a different supplier, feel vague and  somewhat lifeless. On the bright side, this new Camry feels more alert, with a  more refined suspension that feels less floaty and disconnected. Still, we  highly recommend the SE. It's not exactly what we'd call sporty, but its  dynamics do feel more in line with the handling and responsiveness of its best  rivals. The revised interior for the 2012 Camry feels slightly  roomier. Thinner front pillars increase visibility and narrower door panels  open up elbow room. Door panel controls also move higher, allowing knees to  move more freely. The redesigned front seats are not only more comfortable and  supportive, but their thinner backs result in more rear seat legroom. This, in  addition to a nicely reclined seatback angle, helps the Camry match the Honda  Accord for the most comfortable backseat in the class.\nBut the most notable improvement has been regarding interior  design and materials. The previous mismatch of poorly fitted hard plastic has  been replaced with better construction and a more pleasing array of textures,  trim and subtle decorative stitching. The SE trim in particular has a certain  hip vibe that the Camry hasn't possessed in, well, possibly ever.\nThe Camry's new upgraded audio system also includes Entune,  a suite of smartphone-connected services that includes features like the Bing  search engine, Pandora streaming radio, real-time traffic, sports and stock  information, and the ability to reserve movie tickets or a table at a  restaurant on the go. (Entune is optional with the Display Audio package).  We're especially fond of the Camry's new touchscreen interface and accompanying  steering wheel controls, which makes operating your myriad radio and media  player choices a snap. \nThe Camry LE adds auto headlamps, power locks with remote  keyless entry, Bluetooth streaming audio and a central touchscreen interface for  audio, phone and car information.\nThe SE includes a sport-tuned suspension, 17-inch alloy  wheels, foglamps, heated exterior mirrors, unique interior and exterior styling  treatments, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and sport seats. SE V6 models get  18-inch wheels, keyless ignition/entry and an upgraded display interface that  adds navigation, HD radio, satellite radio, voice recognition and Entune  smartphone and Web integration.\nThe luxurious XLE reverts to the LE's softer suspension  settings and adds heated exterior mirrors, foglamps, a sunroof, dual-zone  automatic climate control, an eight-way power driver seat and the upgraded  display interface with Entune. XLE V6 models add a rearview camera, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, leather upholstery, a power front passenger seat and heated front  seats.\nSome of the extra features found on the higher trims can be  added as options to the lower trim levels, though availability can vary  depending on which region of the country you live in. A premium 10-speaker JBL  audio system is optional for the SE and XLE. On the XLE V6, Toyota also offers a  hard-drive-based navigation system with a larger central display.",

    "full_description": "Plenty of automakers offer midsize three-row SUVs, but only a handful bother to offer a hybrid version. One of them is Toyota with its 2021 Highlander Hybrid. It's fair to say the Highlander Hybrid is the originator of the class since Toyota has come out with four generations since 2006. The latest debuted just last year with a more efficient engine, a little more interior space and new technology features.  Powering the Highlander Hybrid is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that's paired to a hybrid system. Combined, they make 243 horsepower. While that's underwhelming compared to the typical V6-powered SUV, the Highlander Hybrid does get an excellent EPA-estimated 35-36 mpg in combined driving. Is the trade-off in power for greater fuel efficiency worth it? Get our in-depth take on the 2021 Toyota Highlander Hybrid by reading our Expert Rating below. With the Highlander Hybrid, we recommend the Limited trim. It's one of the more expensive trim levels \u2014 only the Platinum costs more \u2014 but you get a bunch of appealing features that would otherwise be optional or not available on the LE and XLE. How does the Highlander Hybrid drive? The three-row Highlander has the same hybrid powertrain as the RAV4 Hybrid, though Toyota juiced it up a bit to handle the added weight. Our test Highlander accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 8.2 seconds. That's certainly respectable considering some SUVs with V6s take as much time and are far less fuel-efficient. Emergency braking power is also on par.     Around turns, this hybrid is surprisingly composed. The Highlander Hybrid isn't as athletic as the hybrid version of the Ford Explorer, but handling isn't usually a strong selling point for three-row SUVs. What's more important is ease of driving, and the Highlander Hybrid nails it. Power is readily available and smoothly delivered, and the brakes are smooth and don't exhibit the grabbiness found in some other hybrids. How comfortable is the Highlander Hybrid? The Highlander Hybrid's ride quality is plush. It smooths over most road imperfections yet remains controlled without much float at higher speeds. The wide front seats are pretty comfortable even on long drives, and the available second-row captain's chairs deliver nearly the same level of comfort. Alas, the third-row seats remain one of the Highlander's greatest liabilities. Thin padding, a very low seat cushion and limited legroom make them a no-go for most adults.     We like the Highlander's excellent climate control system. It's easy to use and can quickly heat or cool the cabin. At highway speeds, the Highlander is nicely insulated from wind and road noise. The gas engine sounds unrefined when you go full throttle, but otherwise it's noninvasive. How\u2019s the interior? The first and second seating rows provide ample space. Unfortunately, the Highlander's third row is one of the most confining by midsize three-row SUV standards. If you're planning on regularly using the full passenger capacity, be sure it meets your needs first.      Adjusting the driver's seat is quick and easy, and there's ample range of adjustment. Tall drivers will likely want the steering wheel to telescope out a little more. Outward visibility, especially for a vehicle this size, is great. The windshield roof pillars are thin, helping you see around turns or in tight parking situations.     The Platinum trim, which is what we tested, also comes with some very useful features such as a camera-based rearview mirror that allows you to see out of the back even if you've fully loaded up the rear cargo area. There's also an available surround-view camera system. It has sharp resolution and can be rotated to look around the vehicle. How\u2019s the tech? In recent years, Toyota has trailed other manufacturers when it comes to tech. This latest Highlander Hybrid makes big strides in the right direction, but it still has some minor drawbacks. The optional 12.3-in touchscreen is huge (an 8-inch screen is standard) and it responds quickly to inputs. But its high-gloss surface makes it prone to reflections and smudges. Our Highlander Hybrid Platinum tester had five USB charge ports for the first and second rows but none for the third row.    All Highlanders come standard with a comprehensive suite of advanced driver aids. We like the natural operation of the adaptive cruise control, but we found the lane departure warning slightly too sensitive and the lane centering ineffective at highway speeds. How\u2019s the storage? Cargo space is a bit of a mixed bag with the Highlander Hybrid. Behind the third row, there's only 16 cubic feet of space, which is a bit less than what the Ford Explorer provides. Behind the second row, it expands to a better-than-average 48.4 cubic feet. The liftover height is about average for a midsize SUV.     There's decent space for your things, with a few useful shelves across the dash. If you have a phone charging on the wireless pad in the center bin, you have to remove it to access the space beneath. We didn't find it that cumbersome, but you might.     Got small children? You can easily install a large rear-facing car seat in the second row thanks to the generous amount of fore-and-aft movement of the available captain's chairs. The car seat anchors are also easy to locate and access for all types of seats, though there are no anchors in the third row. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The top trims for the all-wheel-drive Highlander Hybrid get an EPA-estimated 35 mpg combined. Front-wheel-drive versions are a little more efficient at 36 mpg combined.    On our relatively traffic-free evaluation route, we traveled 115 miles at an efficiency of 33 mpg. That's really good for a big three-row SUV, though it's obviously slightly below the EPA estimates. It's still significantly more efficient than the Ford Explorer Hybrid we tested (EPA estimate: 25 mpg combined), which returned 23.3 mpg on average. Is the Highlander Hybrid a good value? The Highlander's interior is solidly put together with soft, padded surfaces where they matter most. Toyota's hybrids have a track record for running long and strong, so odds are high this Highlander will serve you loyally. There's good value here, too, whether you're cross-shopping against a Ford Explorer Hybrid or even a regular gas-only Highlander.    Toyota's warranty coverage is pretty common for the class with three years/36,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage and five years/60,000 miles for the powertrain. Hybrid components are covered for eight years/100,000 miles, and Toyota has extended its hybrid battery coverage for 2020 model year vehicles to a generous 10 years/150,000 miles. The first two years of scheduled maintenance are also free. The Highlander Hybrid isn't something we'd choose for a winding road but it's no less composed than the lighter, non-hybrid version of itself. It's something you'd look forward to taking a long trip in, though, and some might consider that fun.    The Highlander's new styling gives it a more aggressive vibe overall, but we're not sold on the bold details traveling down the side of the car. To us it looks overdone, but to each their own.",

    "full_description": "Previously optional on the Limited top trim level, Toyota's Safety Sense package is now standard on all Avalons. It includes adaptive cruise control, a lane departure warning and intervention system, forward collision warning, automatic pre-collision braking and automatic high-beam headlight control. When you've got a winning formula, it's  typically a good idea to stick with it. And that's pretty much what Toyota has  done with the 2017 Avalon. Redesigned back in 2013, this large sedan has  received only a few updates in the last four years and otherwise has stayed  true as a comfortable, quiet and well-equipped sedan that's just at home  commuting as it is eating up endless miles of American highway.  As far as the basics go, the 2017 Toyota  Avalon pretty much has them all covered. It offers plenty of room for five  adults and a lovely cabin with high-quality materials and very good  construction, plus the choice of many available high-tech features. The Avalon  is extraordinarily comfortable on the highway and whisper quiet, too. It also  handles better than past generations of the car. The ride is definitely firmer  than in previous generations, but the Avalon is still remarkably easy to drive.  If you're in the market for a big sedan, you'll definitely want to go for a  test drive.Notably, we picked the 2017 Toyota Avalon as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars, Trucks and SUVs. With its combination of comfort, overall quality and solid performance, the 2017 Toyota Avalon is one of the best large sedans on the market. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2013 Toyota Avalon XLE (3.5-liter V6;  6-speed automatic). \u00a0   NOTE: Since this test was conducted, the current 2017 Toyota  Avalon has been revised, including some shuffling of standard and optional  equipment, along with the addition of an available sport-tuned suspension. Our  findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Toyota Avalon. With 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque on tap, the Avalon wastes no time getting up to freeway speed and gets from 0 to 60 mph in a quick 6.4 seconds. Few buyers will gripe about its acceleration. The Avalon's pedal is neither hard nor soft, and the car's braking performance is easy and predictable. There's a gentle initial bite and no odd body motions during heavy braking. Steering weight is light in nearly every situation in the Avalon, and it remains accurate. It may be a big car, but this Avalon is very easy to drive. The Avalon manages to be adequately damped to avoid feeling \"floaty.\" Sure, the Avalon isn't as good at dynamic handling maneuvers, but if you're driving this car at the limit of its handling, you're missing the point. The Avalon is easy, approachable and eminently drivable. It's as user-friendly as it should be. Toyota does seat comfort in the Avalon very well. The Avalon's driver seat is pleasant even on long drives. Multilevel heating is standard across styles, and ventilation is optional. Compared to the previous Avalon generation, the ride is definitely busier. But with stiffer springs and firmer damping, it is also more controlled. It's a worthwhile trade. This is one of the quietest cars we've tested. Road, wind and tire noise is virtually nonexistent. Most controls are intuitive and well placed. The audio system's volume knob, however, hides behind the steering wheel at night. Touchpads replace buttons for most controls. Wide door openings, plenty of space, and comfortable seat height front and rear make getting in and out of the Avalon a breeze. The Avalon is a genuine five-passenger sedan. Space in every dimension is more than adequate. Child seats, even the convertible ones, fit easily in the back. We observed no significant shortcomings with visibility while driving the Avalon. Rear-quarter visibility is respectable, and a big windshield provides an excellent view of the road ahead. Toyota's efforts to move the Avalon upscale are obvious. Panel gaps, materials and interior assembly were excellent on our test car. The Avalon is a big step up from your standard Camry. Storage cubbies provide ample room for keys and wallets, and the center console is large. The front section of the center console acts as a convenient \"eBin,\" with power cords passing through a sliding panel for two cellphones and auxiliary and USB connections. At 16 cubic feet, trunk space is very good, but class leaders offer a bit more room. Split-folding rear seats and a ski pass-through are standard. We recommend the 2017 Toyota Avalon in XLE  Plus trim: It is packed with safety and convenience features, a sunroof and  a very well-built interior, but it doesn't break the bank. The base trim level,  the XLE, has almost everything the XLE Plus does, minus the sunroof, so it's a  good choice as well. If you're looking for the top-trim-level treatment, you  can definitely go with the Limited, or for a sportier vibe you can opt for the  Touring. But with all the Avalon's standard equipment, the base XLE and XLE  Plus are hard to pass up.     As  previously mentioned, the XLE is  pretty well equipped for a base trim level, and it feels excellently put  together. It comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine (268 horsepower, 248  pound-feet of torque), a six-speed automatic transmission, 17-inch alloy  wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, leather upholstery, heated front seats, an eight-way  power-adjustable driver seat (with power lumbar support) and a four-way  power-adjustable front passenger seat.    Electronics  features that come standard on the XLE include keyless ignition and entry, a  rearview camera, Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen with Toyota's Entune interface  with voice controls, and an eight-speaker audio system. Added for 2017 as  standard safety equipment on the XLE is the Safety Sense package, which  includes adaptive cruise control, a lane departure warning and intervention  system, forward collision warning, automatic pre-collision braking and  automatic high-beam headlight control.    If  you want to add a sunroof and an auto-dimming rearview mirror to your base XLE,  upgrade to the XLE Plus.    The XLE Premium has a few more  significant upgrades such as driver-seat memory settings, Qi wireless  smartphone charging, integrated navigation, a nine-speaker audio system,  smartphone app integration, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. For  buyers looking for a bit sportier feel from their Avalon, the Touring trim is probably the right  choice. It comes with 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and taillights, a  sport-tuned suspension and unique  interior trim.    Even  shoppers who've owned or driven an Avalon in the past will likely be impressed  by all the equipment that's packed into the Limited trim level. It comes with all the same equipment from the  Touring trim (minus the interior accents) plus xenon headlights, auto-dimming  side mirrors, automatic wipers, ambient cabin lighting, tri-zone automatic  climate control, upgraded leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, a 10-way  power-adjustable driver seat, an eight-way power-adjustable front passenger  seat, heated rear seats, a rear power sunshade, Safety Connect and an 11-speaker JBL premium sound system.",

    "full_description": "The 2012 Toyota RAV4 carries over unchanged save for a newly available touchscreen audio interface and Toyota's Entune suite of Internet-streaming technologies. Spacious, comfortable and easy to drive, the 2012 Toyota RAV4 is good choice for a small-to-midsize crossover SUV, especially if you want a V6 or a usable kid-size third-row seat. Yet newer competitors are definitely worth a look. For those anticipating the 2012 Toyota RAV4 to feature an  all-new design, the above photo may seem like a mistake. However, despite the  widespread assumption that the RAV4 would get a clean-sheet redo for 2012, it  instead soldiers on for another year in its present form.\nAs such, all RAV4 models come off as a little stale compared  to a host of newer crossover SUV competitors. The RAV4's interior is quite  roomy and capable of seating five or seven passengers, but its design,  materials and construction are of a lesser quality than what you'll find in crossovers  like the Chevy Equinox and Dodge Journey. Its V6 engine is still pretty sweet, offering  an appealing blend of better-than-average acceleration and fuel economy, but  the base four-cylinder is a disappointment. Paired to a behind-the-times  four-speed automatic, its fuel economy is below average for the class and only  2 mpg thriftier than the V6.\nIn light of this, you'd be wise to check out the  aforementioned American competitors along with the Honda  CR-V, Kia  Sorento and Subaru Outback. But  that doesn't mean you should completely write off the RAV4. Its ability to  effortlessly make the transition from an accommodating family runabout to a  cargo-schlepping pack mule can't be beat. And this year the RAV4 Limited model  should stand out thanks to the availability of Toyota's new Entune suite of electronics  features. So even if the 2012 Toyota RAV4 has gone a little past its expiration  date, it's still a good choice for a small or midsize crossover. Every 2012 Toyota RAV4 trim level is available with two  different engines and either front- or all-wheel drive. The availability of  these combinations can depend on where you live, however.\nThe standard 2.5-liter four-cylinder produces 179 horsepower  and 172 pound-feet of torque. A four-speed automatic is standard, and with  front-wheel drive includes an automatic limited-slip differential (auto LSD).  EPA-estimated fuel economy with front-wheel drive is 22 mpg city/28 mpg highway  and 24 mpg combined. This drops to 21/27/24 with all-wheel drive, and both  estimates are a tad disappointing given the V6's fuel economy as well as the  RAV4's many competitors.\nThe 3.5-liter V6 produces 269 hp and 246 lb-ft of torque. A  five-speed automatic is standard, and it, too, gets the auto LSD with front-wheel  drive. In Edmunds performance testing, a RAV4 V6 with all-wheel drive went from  zero to 60 mph in 7.2 seconds, which is better than average for its class. The  EPA estimates that it'll achieve 19/27/22 with front-wheel drive and 19/26/22  with AWD. This is thrifty among V6-powered crossover SUVs.\nThe all-wheel-drive system sends  power to the front wheels until tire slippage is detected and then power is  also directed to the rear wheels. The torque split can be manually locked at 50  percent front/50 percent rear for driving in poor traction conditions, such as  gravel or snow. With the optional tow package, the RAV4 V6 can pull as much as  3,500 pounds. Antilock disc brakes, stability  control, traction control, whiplash-reducing front headrests, front-seat side  airbags and full-length side curtain airbags are standard on every 2012 Toyota  RAV4. Vehicles equipped with the V6 and/or the optional third-row seats also  come with hill-start assist and hill-descent control.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, a four-cylinder  RAV4 came to a stop from 60 mph in 125 feet -- an average distance for a  compact crossover. The heavier RAV4 EV still managed to remain competitive at  126 feet.\nIn government crash testing, the RAV4 received an overall score of three stars (out  of five). It got three stars for overall frontal crash protection and four  stars for overall side crash protection. In  crash tests done by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the RAV4 earned  the top rating of \"Good\" in both the frontal-offset and side-impact  crash tests. It achieved the second-best rating of \"Acceptable\" in  the roof strength test. Although relatively capable off  the beaten path, the 2012 Toyota RAV4 is meant for a life on pavement. Its taut  suspension and precise electric-assist steering make daily errands a pleasant (although  not particularly interesting) experience. The RAV4 is not as responsive to control  inputs as the Honda CR-V or Kia Sorento, but the Toyota offers a smooth ride  that's forgiving enough for commuters who drive on crumbling expressways. Road  noise can be an issue, and in total the RAV4 seems less buttoned-down and solid  on the highway than the Chevy Equinox or Dodge Journey.\nThe RAV's four-cylinder version is  a reasonable choice for most buyers, as it provides adequate power for day-to-day  driving. However, its four-speed transmission and fuel economy are  unimpressive, and if we were to buy a 2012 Toyota RAV4, it would have to come  with the optional V6. It generates 90 hp more than the inline-4 engine, yet  according to the EPA, you'd only spend about $200 more per year. We  highly recommend finding the extra dough to get it. The RAV4's interior boasts a clean  design with large, simple controls and lots of storage space. Overall interior quality  is acceptable, but most competitors now make the RAV's interior look too  insubstantial and budget-oriented. Several rivals also come with additional  standard equipment.\nNevertheless, the Toyota RAV4 is a  model of practicality. The rear seats recline and can slide fore and aft to  optimize passenger space or cargo capacity. Normal seating capacity is five,  while the optional third-row seat bumps it to seven. Though this seat is meant  only for children, it is at least reasonably sturdy and spacious for them.\nTo configure the RAV4 for cargo,  all you need to do is flip a lever in the cargo area to fold the second-row  seats flat. Honda now offers this feature in its CR-V, but in the  process, lost the second row's ability to slide fore and aft -- a capability  the RAV4 continues to offer. With all seats lowered,  there's an impressive 73 cubic feet of cargo capacity. The load floor is also  quite low for this class, which minimizes the strain of loading a week's worth  of groceries or makes it easy for a dog to climb aboard. However, the Toyota's  tailgate can be an inconvenience when you're parked on the street, as it has  hinges on the right side, the opposite of what you want for curbside loading in  the United States. \nThe base RAV4 comes standard with 16-inch steel wheels, full  power accessories, air-conditioning, cruise control, a height-adjustable driver  seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, 60/40-split sliding and reclining  second-row seat (with remote cargo-area folding), Bluetooth phone and audio  connectivity, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, auxiliary audio  jack and an iPod/USB audio interface. One can upgrade to 17-inch steel or alloy  wheels. The Upgrade Value package includes the alloy wheels, a roof rack, rear  privacy glass, a sunroof, a cargo cover and upgraded upholstery.\nThe Sport adds 18-inch alloy wheels, sportier suspension  tuning, foglamps, rear privacy glass and upgraded upholstery. V6-powered models  get automatic headlamps. The Appearance package adds run-flat tires and a  different tailgate design (in lieu of the tailgate-mounted spare tire), heated  mirrors and chrome-look interior trim. The Enhancement Value package adds a  roof rack and sunroof.\nThe Limited lacks the Sport suspension and reverts back to 17-inch  alloy wheels, but adds automatic headlamps, heated mirrors, a hard-shell spare  tire cover, a roof rack (optional on other trims), keyless ignition/entry,  dual-zone automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a  cargo cover (optional on other trims). \nThe Premium package available on the Sport and Limited  includes leather upholstery, an eight-way power driver seat and heated front  seats. On the Limited only, the Premium Plus Value package adds a sunroof to  these items, while the Navigation Value package goes further with a navigation  system, a touchscreen interface and Toyota's Entune system, which includes  real-time information (traffic, weather, fuel prices, sports scores) and a  suite of apps that connect the car to Internet sites like Pandora, iHeart Radio  and Open Table through your smartphone. V6-powered models can be equipped with  a towing package.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota RAV4 gets updated styling for 2016, including a sleeker front fascia. There's also a new SE trim that boasts sharper handling, LED headlights and additional distinctive styling elements inside and out. A new Toyota Safety Sense package available on the SE and Limited includes a variety of high-tech accident avoidance technologies. Finally, a new RAV4 Hybrid also debuts. Although the 2016 Toyota RAV4 isn't a standout in any one area, its combination of features, passenger space and everyday utility warrant a closer look if you're shopping for a small crossover.  As any sports fan will attest, sometimes you can have a  well-rounded team, play at a competitive level, pack the stands and still fail  to find glory. Well, we hereby present that as a metaphor for the 2016 Toyota  RAV4. It's spacious, versatile, decent to drive, comfortable and well-equipped,  and it also enjoys one of the best reliability reputations in its segment. Trouble  is, there are competitors that match or beat it in those areas while going a  few steps further in others. \nTo its credit, Toyota has tinkered with the RAV4 this year in hopes of improving its appeal. The  exterior styling has been subtly massaged, especially up front, where there's a  more streamlined look that modernizes this crossover's mien. The 2016 RAV4 also  adds an SE trim to its portfolio. The SE, following in the footsteps of Toyota's  popular Camry and Sienna SE trims, boasts sporty styling flourishes and a suspension  tuned for better handling. \nWhat thankfully carries over is the RAV4's impressive cabin  space. The cargo area is large, boxy and its load floor is low, making it one  of the most versatile compact crossovers available. Need to carry the box for a  Little Tikes playhouse or lug around a vivacious Weimaraner? The RAV4 is well  suited to the task. It also offers one of the most accommodating cabins for passengers.  It's this spacious interior, along with the RAV4's history of dependability,  that constitutes this compact crossover's primary appeal.\nYet, the RAV4 isn't the only model with a polished resum\u00e9.  The Honda CR-V is just as  spacious and dependable, but it can also claim superior fuel economy and an  even more versatile cabin. To a lesser extent, the same can be said of the rugged Subaru Forester,  which also boasts best-in-class acceleration with its optional turbocharged  engine. Then there's the Mazda  CX-5, which isn't quite as utilitarian but offers a more dynamic, carlike  driving experience. The 2016 RAV4 is a well-rounded, solid competitor that's popular  for good reason, but a few of the other members of this league may stand a  better chance of winning you over. The 2016 Toyota RAV4 is motivated by a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder that produces 176 horsepower and 172 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed  automatic transmission and front-wheel drive are standard, and all-wheel drive  is optional. \nIn Edmunds testing, an  all-wheel-drive Toyota RAV4 took 9.2 seconds to hit 60 mph, an average time for  a small crossover with a four-cylinder engine of this size.\nThe EPA estimates that the front-wheel-drive RAV4 returns 26 mpg  combined (23 city/30 highway) while the all-wheel-drive version returns 25 mpg  combined (22 city/29 highway). These estimates are slightly lower than those  of certain competitors, notably the Honda CR-V and Mazda CX-5. Every 2016 Toyota RAV4 includes antilock brakes, stability and  traction control, front side airbags, full-length airbags, a driver knee airbag,  a rearview camera and an integrated driver blind-spot mirror. A blind-spot  warning system and rear cross-traffic alert are optional on the XLE and standard  on the SE and Limited. \nThe optional Toyota Safety Sense system (standard on the  Limited) includes a forward collision warning system (with pedestrian detection),  forward collision mitigation with automatic emergency braking, a lane-departure  warning and intervention system and automatic high-beam headlight control. \nIn Edmunds brake testing, a RAV4 Limited AWD stopped from 60  mph in 128 feet, which is a few feet longer than average. \nIn government  crash tests, the RAV4 received five out of five stars for overall crash  protection, with four stars for total frontal protection and five stars for total  side protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the 2016 RAV4  the best  possible rating of \"Good\" in the small- and moderate-overlap  frontal-offset crash test as well as the side-impact and roof-strength tests.  It also received a \"Good\" rating for the performance of its head  restraints and seats, as well as the best possible rating of \"Superior\"  for its available forward collision warning and mitigation system.  The 2016 RAV4's 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine is powerful  enough for most tasks and returns pretty good fuel economy. Toyota doesn't  offer an optional V6 anymore, though, so if you want more pep you'll need to  look elsewhere.\nThe engine's six-speed automatic transmission shifts  smoothly, but if you tend to drive assertively, you'll find it slow to  downshift in passing situations. Additionally, when climbing steady mountain grades,  we've noticed that the transmission has a tendency to hunt between gears  (rather than picking one gear and sticking with it). Both of these  characteristics are likely a consequence of the powertrain being tuned for  maximum gas mileage.\nWe do like how the Toyota RAV4 feels refined and comfortable  when cruising down the highway. It's also steady and composed going around  turns. Although we've yet to sample the new SE trim, we suspect it will offer a  ride-handling balance more akin to those offered by sportier rivals. At the  same time, both the SE and Limited come with 18-inch wheels that some may find  result in a ride that's too firm and jittery. \nOverall, the RAV4 is similar in personality to Honda's ultimately  more impressive CR-V, less entertaining to drive than rivals like the CX-5 and Ford  Escape, and less capable of venturing off the beaten path than the Forester and  Jeep Cherokee. Again, it's perfectly pleasant, but it's not a segment standout  from behind the wheel.  The 2016 Toyota RAV4 features an interior design with  pronounced angles and lines that form a streamlined and modern-looking dash. A  few of the audio and climate controls feel slightly flimsy, however, and while  the cupholder count is adequate, there aren't as many useful storage cubbies up  front as you'll find in the Honda CR-V. If you want genuine leather upholstery,  you're out of luck as the RAV4 comes only with cloth or leatherette.\nAlthough all of the RAV4's  audio systems have Toyota's Entune branding, only models with the bigger 7-inch  screen include the Entune suite of smartphone-connected services, among these Pandora streaming radio and a  navigation app. Thankfully, the touchscreen interface itself has  straightforward menus, large virtual buttons and faster responses for 2016. All  conventional controls are also easy to use.\nRear passenger comfort is hampered slightly by a low-mounted  bottom cushion, but space is nevertheless abundant even for taller adults. We  also like how the 60/40-split seatbacks provide a large amount of recline  adjustment.\nThe cargo bay measures 38.4 cubic feet and opens up to a  generous 73.3 cubes when the second row is folded. That's one of the largest  capacities in the class. There's also a payoff for that low-mounted rear seat:  a very flat load floor and low load-in height, both of which help minimize the  strain of loading heavy items or help dogs jump aboard. The power-operated and  height-adjustable liftgate is especially convenient. \nThe LE comes standard with 17-inch steel wheels, an  integrated driver blind-spot mirror, rear privacy glass, roof rails,  air-conditioning, a rearview camera, cruise control, a height-adjustable driver  seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a 60/40-split folding and reclining  rear seat, a 6.1-inch touchscreen interface (Entune), Bluetooth phone and audio  connectivity, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, an auxiliary  audio jack, a USB port and a media player interface.\nOptional for the LE is the Entune Audio Plus package, which  adds satellite and HD radios, traffic and weather information, Siri Eyes Free  for iPhones and the Scout GPS Link navigation smartphone integration app.\nThe XLE includes the Entune Audio Plus package plus 17-inch  alloy wheels, foglights, heated mirrors, a sunroof, a height-adjustable power  liftgate, dual-zone automatic climate control, more aggressively bolstered  front seats and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\nThis year's new SE adds to the standard XLE equipment a sport-tuned  suspension; different exterior styling; 18-inch wheels; LED exterior lighting  (automatic headlights, running lights and taillights); keyless ignition and  entry; heated front seats; an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar);  driver memory settings; synthetic leather (SofTex) upholstery; steering wheel  paddle shifters; a blind-spot warning system; and rear cross-traffic alert. \nThe Limited shares the XLE's suspension and styling, but  includes the SE's other equipment along with chrome-clad 18-inch wheels and exterior  trim, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, the Toyota Safety Sense package (see  Safety section), adaptive cruise control, a 7-inch higher-resolution  touchscreen, a navigation system and smartphone app integration.\nOptional for the XLE and SE is the Entune Premium Audio  package, which adds the bigger touchscreen, nav system and smartphone app  integration. The XLE's Convenience package bundles those features with keyless  ignition and entry, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, front  and rear parking sensors and the Safety Sense package.\nThe SE and Limited can also be equipped with an 11-speaker  JBL sound system as well as the Advanced Technology package that includes that  system plus a 360-degree top-down parking camera system, front and rear parking  sensors and, on the SE, adaptive cruise control and the Toyota Safety Sense  package.

The 2014 Toyota Tundra remains a capable workhorse among full-size pickups, but even with this year's updates, it lags behind newer rivals in fuel efficiency and ride comfort. After years of standing pat, Toyota has finally pulled the trigger on a major restyling of the full-size Tundra. It's not the complete overhaul you might expect at this point in the truck's life cycle, though. Toyota has left the Tundra's powertrain and suspension hardware largely unchanged, and that's a potential liability in the light-duty full-size truck class, in which competitors continue to set new benchmarks for fuel economy and ride comfort.\nRecently, Edmunds.com gave the 2014 Toyota Tundra an overall \"B\" rating and we praised the practical interior and updated styling. If you're a fan of traditional truck styling, this truck should be right up your alley. The previously rounded edges have given way to squared-off lines, even around the fenders. The hood sits higher than before, with a larger, brighter grille out front. Should you doubt Toyota's intent to give its full-size pickup a huskier image, you can't miss the large \"Tundra\" badge stamped into the tailgate.\nInside, last year's deep instrument binnacles have been replaced by a traditional gauge cluster that's far more handsome and readable. What's more, the previously heroic reach to the Tundra's radio and climate knobs has been remedied by a center stack that's now 2.6 inches closer to the driver. Toyota has also added its Entune suite of smartphone-connected services to help bring the Tundra more in line with its competition. Although the ability to stream Internet radio and search for points of interest on Bing are nice features, we would have liked to see the automaker add another USB port or two, as even top trims have only a single port (whereas competitors offer multiple charging ports).\nOtherwise, the 2014 Toyota Tundra feels much like last year's truck. The entry-level V6 remains just that, while the midrange 4.6-liter V8 is smooth and capable. The top-of-the-line 5.7-liter V8 is stellar, as good as anything the competition is offering -- except in the fuel economy department. Ride quality is also a bit behind the times, as the Toyota is choppy over bumps. To top it off, the Tundra feels like the big truck it is, whereas newer rivals feel smaller and more maneuverable.\nIf refinement comes as an afterthought to workhorse duties, the 2014 Toyota Tundra remains a worthy option for a full-size truck. Still, the competition matches its abilities while offering superior fuel economy, road manners and tech features in the cabin. The Ram 1500 is our top pick in this class, especially with its diesel engine option for 2014, and the redesigned Chevrolet Silverado (and its GMC Sierra twin) is another great choice. The Ford F-150 is getting on in years as well, but it remains a solid all-around choice, particularly with its strong yet efficient EcoBoost V6 engine option. The 2014 Toyota Tundra is offered with a choice of three engines and rear-wheel or four-wheel drive. Unlike on the competition, each engine comes with a single rear axle ratio, making it easier to configure a truck that meets your needs.\nRear-wheel-drive SR models come with a 4.0-liter V6 that puts out 270 horsepower and 278 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed automatic transmission is standard. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 17 mpg combined (16 mpg city/20 mpg highway).\nNext up is a 4.6-liter V8 that produces 310 hp and 327 lb-ft of torque. It's optional for the 2WD SR double cab and standard for the 4WD SR double cab and all SR5 models. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 16 mpg combined (15 mpg city/19 mpg highway) on 2WD models; 4WD versions also rate 16 mpg combined but have lower city/highway figures.\nA 5.7-liter V8 is the most powerful engine available for the 2014 Tundra. It's standard on 4WD regular cabs and all Limited, Platinum and 1794 trims, and optional on the other models. It generates 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque, and comes with a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 15 mpg combined (13 mpg city/18 mpg highway) on two-wheel-drive models; 4WD models also rate 15 mpg combined but drop a point on the highway rating. A tow package is standard on all Tundras equipped with the 5.7-liter V8, and towing capacity tops out at 10,400 pounds when properly equipped.\nIn Edmunds testing, a 1794 Tundra with four-wheel drive accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 6.8 seconds, which is one of the quickest times in the segment. The 2014 Toyota Tundra comes standard with antilock brakes, stability and traction control, trailer sway control, front side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags that cover both rows and front knee airbags. A rearview camera is standard across the board, while parking sensors are optional on the Limited and standard on the Platinum and 1794 Edition. A blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alerts is optional on the Limited, Platinum and 1794 models. During Edmunds' braking test, a 1794 Tundra with 4WD came to a stop from 60 mph in 130 feet, which is about average for the segment. Despite the size of the 2014 Toyota Tundra, nobody's going to feel sold short by the 5.7-liter V8. It may not be a class leader in horsepower anymore, but it remains a champ for towing thanks to its prodigious torque and well-sorted six-speed automatic. Casual users probably will find the 4.6-liter V8's shove adequate for most driving situations short of big-time towing, and it provides better fuel economy -- although neither V8 is a class standout in this department. The entry-level V6 is available only on 2WD regular cabs; if you want a full-size truck with a six-cylinder, the offerings from Ford and Ram are better bets.\nThe Toyota's light but accurate steering makes it fairly easy to drive on a daily basis, but the Tundra feels bigger and less comfortable than competing trucks. Even with various suspension revisions for 2014, the Tundra still has a stiff ride over bumps and ruts. While cruising, it's not very quiet, either, and that contributes to the very trucklike feel. Inside, the Tundra has received a thorough update for 2014. Everything seems at once larger and more legible, and the uncomfortably long reach to the audio and climate dials and buttons on the center console has been shortened by reorienting the dashboard 2.6 inches closer to the driver. The instrument cluster now features two conventional and wonderfully legible dials for the speedometer and tachometer. It's nothing wacky or trendy -- it's just instrumentation that works.\nThe 2014 Toyota Tundra's interior materials also look and feel higher-quality than in past years, and the leather appointments in the upper trims are particularly appealing. A touchscreen display is now standard across the board, and most models are available with Entune, a suite of smartphone-connected services that includes such features as the Bing search engine, Pandora streaming radio, real-time traffic and sports and stock information. Getting started with Entune can be a hassle, though, since you have to install an app on your phone and register for an account, plus you always need an active data connection to use it.\nThe front seats in every trim are broad and comfortable, but as this is a truck, you shouldn't expect much in the way of lateral support. There's a vast amount of legroom and headroom in the backseat of the CrewMax, which shouldn't surprise considering the enormity of this configuration's footprint. The folding rear seats in double cabs and CrewMax models also provide a good amount of protected storage for valuable items you'd rather not leave in the bed.  \nAdded to this matrix are five trim levels: the base Tundra SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum and 1794 Edition. Not all of these variations are available together, and the availability of some options depends on the region where you live.\nStandard equipment on the entry-level SR regular cab models includes 18-inch steel wheels; a matte black lower front bumper, rear bumper and grille surround; tow hooks (four-wheel-drive models); keyless entry; heated mirrors; full power accessories; a windshield wiper de-icer; a damped tailgate; cruise control; air-conditioning; cloth upholstery; a 40/20/40-split bench seat with four-way manual adjustment for the driver's and passenger sections; a tilt-only steering wheel; two 12-volt power outlets; Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity; a 6.1-inch touchscreen; a rearview camera; and a four-speaker audio system with a CD player and USB/auxiliary audio inputs. Options for the base 2014 Tundra include a bed rail system and a Work Truck package with vinyl seats and flooring.\nGet the SR Tundra in the double cab body style and you add front and rear map lights, an eight-way manually adjustable driver seat (four-way for the passenger) 60/40-split fold-up rear seats and two extra speakers.\nThe SR5 trim is available in the double cab and CrewMax body styles. Additional standard equipment includes foglights, a chrome grille surround, chrome rear bumper, variable intermittent wipers, a center-console shifter, an upgraded instrument panel, a manual sliding rear window (power sliding in the CrewMax, which also gets an overhead console), a higher-resolution 7-inch touchscreen display, satellite radio and HD radio. The optional SR5 Upgrade package brings front bucket seats with an eight-way power driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a front console, a rear under-seat storage tray (double cab only) and an alarm system. The TRD Off-Road package adds 18-inch alloy wheels, all-terrain tires, an off-road-tuned suspension, skid plates and tow hooks (2WD models). \nThe Limited trim adds 20-inch alloy wheels, chrome heated side mirrors, a more upscale silver billet grille, the bed-rail system, dual-zone automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather upholstery, power front bucket seats (10-way driver, four-way passenger), heated front seats, a power-operated sliding rear window (double cab), an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a navigation system and the Entune smartphone app suite. The Limited Premium option package provides front and rear parking sensors, one-touch power windows, illuminated entry lighting and a glass-breakage sensor.\nThe Platinum trim comes only in the CrewMax cab and adds trim-specific 20-inch wheels, more chrome exterior detailing, power-folding outside mirrors that are heated and auto-dimming, a sunroof, upgraded leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, driver-seat memory functions and an upgraded sound system with 12 JBL speakers.\nAt the top of the 2014 Tundra range is the 1794 Edition (named for the Texas ranch on which a portion of the Tundra assembly plant now stands). Available only as a CrewMax, the 1794 adds unique silver exterior details, saddle-brown leather upholstery with simulated suede trim for the front seats and matching soft-touch materials for the shift console, door trim and instrument panel.\nA blind-spot monitoring system with cross-traffic alerts is optional on the Limited, Platinum and 1794 Edition models.",

    "full_description": "For 2012, the Toyota Avalon is unchanged. The 2012 Toyota Avalon is a solid choice for a full-size sedan, but some newer and less expensive competitors might be more appealing. For decades, full-size cars were as much a part of the American landscape as drive-in theaters. But just like this icon of the American landscape, only a handful of full-size models remain. Within this group, the 2012 Toyota Avalon continues to be a well-known and respectable choice. \nDebuting back in 2005, the current-generation, Camry-based Avalon is one of Toyota's oldest models, even if it underwent a significant design overhaul last year. But there's still a lot to like here, including a spacious cabin, excellent visibility and a refined ride. Also maintaining big sedan tradition is the Avalon's massive backseat, which boasts standard reclining seatbacks, abundant headroom and an available power rear sunshade.\nUnlike in years past, however, the Avalon now faces more competent competitors, such as the stylish Buick LaCrosse, the impressively revamped Chrysler 300, the tech-oriented Ford Taurus and the upscale Hyundai Genesis. Compared to these models, the Avalon can come off as less refined and a bit boring due to its conservative styling and overall driving demeanor.\nPerhaps most importantly, the Avalon's base price when new starts anywhere from about $3,000-$7,000 above the base versions of its chief rivals. But overall the 2012 Toyota Avalon is still worth consideration given its success in fulfilling the core aspects that most full-size sedan shoppers will be looking for. The front-wheel-drive 2012 Toyota  Avalon is motivated by a 3.5-liter V6 rated at 268 horsepower and 248  pound-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, an  Avalon Limited accelerated to 60 mph in 6.8 seconds, a reasonably quick time  for a large sedan. The EPA's fuel mileage estimates for the Avalon stand at 19  mpg city/28 mpg highway and 23 mpg combined, making  it one of the more fuel-efficient full-size sedans available. Standard safety equipment on the 2012  Toyota Avalon includes antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control,  active front head restraints, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and  a driver-side knee airbag. During Edmunds brake testing, the Avalon came to a  stop from 60 mph in 129 feet, a slightly longer-than-average distance for this  class.\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway  Safety testing, the Avalon earned the top score of \"Good\" for its  protection of occupants in frontal-offset, side-impact and roof-strength tests. Not surprisingly, the 2012 Toyota  Avalon is at its best on the open highway. The ultra-smooth V6 engine has  plenty of passing power and the suspension swallows up road imperfections  without drama. The Avalon is no athlete, though, so those interested in a  slightly more involved driving experience should consider the Buick LaCrosse or  Chrysler 300. And although it's reasonably quiet as cars go, the Avalon does  generate more road noise at highway speeds than most other full-size sedans. The Toyota Avalon's interior feels  upscale and inviting thanks to its glowing gauges, attractive and ergonomic  control layout and high-quality materials. Standard wood and metallic accents  further the luxury ambience, making the Avalon impressively similar to its  upscale cousins from Lexus. That said, the Avalon's competitors have a similar  interior ambience.\nThe front seats are wide and  accommodating, and the Avalon Limited offers them heated, ventilated and with a  seat cushion length adjuster. The rear seats are very comfortable as well.  Legroom is abundant even by full-size sedan standards, and the seatbacks  recline, which allows passengers to stretch out on long trips. A 6-footer can  sit in back with more than enough knee- and headroom. And with a nearly flat  floor, getting three into the backseat on carpool day is no problem, which is a  noticeable advantage compared to some of the Avalon's rear-drive competitors.\nOne minor annoyance is the inability  to fold the rear seats down -- the trade-off for the reclining feature. The  trunk measures 14.4 cubic feet, which is smaller than what's available in other  full-size sedans. \nStandard equipment on the base Avalon includes 17-inch alloy  wheels, foglights, auto-dimming driver and rearview mirrors, heated mirrors, a  sunroof, automatic headlights, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate  control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, an eight-way power driver seat,  a reclining rear seat, leather upholstery, a rearview camera (mounted in the  rearview mirror), Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity and a nine-speaker sound  system with a six-CD changer, satellite radio, an auxiliary audio jack and a USB/iPod  interface.\nThe Limited adds xenon headlights, automatic wipers, keyless  ignition/entry, additional power driver seat adjustment, a power passenger  seat, heated and ventilated front seats, driver memory functions, a power rear  sunshade and a 12-speaker sound system.\nA few of the Limited's features, such as the upgraded sound system  and heated seats, are available on the base Avalon, while a voice-activated  touchscreen navigation system with real-time traffic is optional for both  trims.",

    "full_description": "The  2019 Toyota Sequoia is one of just a few traditional truck-based SUVs around.  It has a robust V8 engine that helps this big SUV tow more than 7,000 pounds.  Seating is available for seven or eight, and there are plenty of nooks and pockets  to store all your passengers' favorite road-trip amenities. Alternately, fold  down the second- and third-row seats to exponentially increase cargo volume. \nAn  optional four-wheel-drive system gives the Sequoia surprisingly competent  off-road capability. Your biggest trail limitations will be the Sequoia's sheer  size and wheelbase. A TRD Sport package upgrades the suspension for better  handling and performance over harsh impacts typical of off-roading, but the  updates are great on the road as well.\nThe  Sequoia is a very functional SUV, but it has drawbacks. Though powerful, that  V8 engine lacks the efficiency that most buyers in this category have come to  expect. Also, the Sequoia's infotainment interface, with its dinky 6-inch  screen and lack of full smartphone integration capability, is about as  geriatric as these things get. \nWe  prefer the Ford Expedition. Recently redesigned, it bests the Sequoia in just  about every metric. And if you don't need massive towing capability, a  three-row crossover SUV will likely suit you just fine. Overall, though, the  aging Toyota Sequoia's exceptional utility and V8 brawn give it a certain  amount of timeless appeal.  Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the Toyota Sequoia TRD Sport (5.7L V8 |  6-speed automatic | 4WD). Think of the Sequoia as a Tundra pickup  with three rows and an SUV roof. It's got the same kind of effortless power  from its big V8 engine, and that makes it well-suited to towing trailers, boats  and other toys. It also makes for easy highway passing when it's not pulling a  load. That's backed up by our track-measured 0-60 mph acceleration time of 7.2  seconds, which is only a few tenths behind the class leader.\u00a0 \nAt  almost 6,100 pounds, and with light steering that doesn't have much road feel,  the Sequoia isn't our first pick for winding roads. But it's surprisingly agile  for its size, and the upgraded TRD Pro suspension should make hill climbs and  descents a little more stable and add some confidence to braking maneuvers. All-around comfort and surprising serenity  are the Sequoia's main strengths. The seats don't offer much side-to-side  support. They're basically just big chairs that provide good long-haul support.  The front seats are limited in adjustments, however. We do like the Sequoia's  plush ride quality. It absorbs impacts and shrugs off smaller bumps not unlike  a luxury SUV. \nTire  and wind noise is well-suppressed, but you'll hear the engine straining when  it's working hard. The height-adjustable suspension helps maintain comfort when  hauling heavy loads. The air conditioning blows strong and cold in the back  row, but it's oddly weak up front when all three zones are pumping. The Sequoia feels spacious, but you expect  that given its size. Getting into the Sequoia's first two rows requires a step  up, but the running boards and grab handles help. The second-row seats tilt and  slide, making for easy third-row entry, but getting out requires a limber,  deliberate effort, especially for tall adults.\nThere  is plenty of room for heads, arms, elbows and shoulders all around. The downside  is that the driver and front passenger will need to stretch to reach the  touchscreen and stereo controls. The third row is narrow but offers good adult  legroom. It's fine for short trips, but you don't really want more than six  adults in this SUV.  Utility is the Sequoia's game. Its cargo  space, which is helped by two rows of fold-flat seats, is among the largest in  the class and is arguably the key reason you buy a Sequoia. With 120.1 cubic  feet of maximum space, it's only beat by the Chevrolet Suburban and the Ford  Expedition Max. \nWith  seats up, it's still impressive: 67 cubic feet with just the third row folded  and 19 cubes of room for groceries with the third row up. A power liftgate  enhances the ability to stuff the Sequoia full of gear. Slimmer plastic panels  would increase capacity, but it's impressive as it is. The Sequoia offers so  many nooks and cubbies that some personal items will disappear forever. Next to rival systems, the  Sequoia's infotainment is woefully deficient. The touchscreen media interface  is small, dated and limited. It just has the basics: Bluetooth, one USB port  and one auxiliary audio jack. There is no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto  support. But Bluetooth pairing is easy and offers browsing of a device's audio  library. The single-screen rear DVD entertainment system is good enough to make  passengers forget about their iPads for a while. \nActive  safety tech, on the other hand, is comprehensive. And it's all standard\nfrom the base model on up. Every Sequoia has  automatic emergency braking, blind-spot and cross-traffic monitoring, front and  rear parking sensors, lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control. The SR5 is the affordable base model,  but when equipped with the available Premium  Package, this SUV is a well-equipped eight-passenger family hauler. The  Premium Package includes gotta-have SUV items such as navigation, power-folding  third-row seats, and heated, power leather front seats. Thanks to the standard  V8 engine, you won't have to worry about matching a trim with the engine; the  only question is, do you want two-wheel drive or four? \nThe  2019 Toyota Sequoia is powered by a 5.7-liter V8 (381 horsepower, 401 lb-ft of  torque) and a six-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard,  and four-wheel drive is optional. You can get the Sequoia in one of four trims:  the base SR5, the TRD Sport, the Limited (blending luxury and functionality) and the fully loaded Platinum model. There are significant  price jumps between trims, but there are option packages for the SR5 and the  Limited that help bridge the gaps. The SR5 and Limited models seat eight  passengers, while the second-row captain's chairs on the TRD Sport and the  Platinum reduce seating to seven.\nThe  base SR5 model comes stocked with a  healthy number of standard features. Highlights include 18-inch wheels, LED  headlights, a sunroof, a power rear window, tri-zone automatic climate control,  a power-adjustable driver's seat, a 40/20/40-split second-row bench seat (with  sliding and reclining functionality), a 60/40-split reclining and fold-flat  third-row bench, second- and third-row retractable sunshades, a rearview  camera, Bluetooth, a USB port, a 6.1-inch touchscreen, and an eight-speaker  audio system with a CD player and satellite and HD radio.\nStandard  safety features for the SR5 include forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking, lane departure warning, front and rear parking sensors, a  rearview camera, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and  traffic-adapting cruise control.\nAn  optional SR5 Premium package bundles an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather  upholstery, a power-adjustable passenger seat, heated front seats, a power  liftgate, a power-reclining and -folding third-row seat, and an integrated  navigation system.\nThe TRD Sport has a few mechanical  differences that set it apart from the rest of the Sequoia line. It rides on  20-inch TRD wheels and features sport-tuned dampers and stiffer front and rear  anti-roll bars to help the car handle better on the road and take bumps off the  road. The other changes are all cosmetic, such as unique badging and front  grille, blacked-out taillights, and TRD trim pieces.\nCompared  to the SR5, stepping up to the Limited model  gets you 20-inch wheels, power-folding and auto-dimming exterior mirrors,  upgraded gauges and everything from the SR5's Premium package.\nA  seven-passenger option swaps the second-row bench for two captain's chairs,  reducing seating capacity to seven. A premium 14-speaker JBL sound system  (bundled with driver-seat memory settings) is optional, as is a rear-seat  entertainment system with a Blu-ray player.\nThe  top-of-the-line Platinum trim level  comes standard with all of the above features, plus an adaptive air suspension  (with a load-leveling rear), ventilated front seats, heated second-row  captain's chairs (seating seven), a second-row center console and a  power-adjustable steering wheel.",

    "full_description": "For 2015 the Toyota Prius gets the addition of a Persona Series trim level, which adds some cosmetic equipment to the Prius Three trim level. Also, a rearview camera is now standard across all five trim levels. The 2015 Toyota Prius remains the quintessential hybrid car and a solid all-around choice, though other, newer hybrids are more enjoyable to drive. One of the most identifiable cars on the market, the Toyota Prius has pretty much become  synonymous with the word \"hybrid.\" And with good reason -- not only  has it been a pioneer but also by far the most popular hybrid in terms of  sales. But a lot of new hybrids have come out in recent years, so it's right to  wonder how the 2015 Toyota Prius continues to hold up.\nWell, if it's fuel economy you're looking for, the Prius will  still be your huckleberry. With an EPA combined estimate of 50 miles per  gallon, you won't find another competing hybrid that can match it. Also in the  Prius' favor: it's reliable, easy to drive around town and spacious thanks to  the hatchback design. The backseat is large enough for full-size adults and  there's a lot of cargo space, especially with the rear seats folded flat. With  five different trim levels, there's a wide variety of available features, too  -- options range from touchscreen navigation to styling and suspension tweaks.  From plain to flashy, you can equip a Prius any way you'd like, but it will  remain frugal between visits to the pump. \u00a0\nThe Prius definitely has an edge when it comes to mileage,  but otherwise, it's a bit basic. The interior feels a little low buck, with  lots of hard plastic on the dashboard and door panels. It is a bit noisy, too,  with noticeable wind and tire noise making their way into the cabin. And  although a fun driving experience probably isn't at the top of your list if  you're interested in a Prius, know that acceleration is slow and even with the  sport-tuned suspension the Prius isn't as entertaining to drive as some rivals. \n\n  Those rivals can offer nearly similar mileage along with some added panache.  The 2015 Ford C-Max is a good example as it's more refined and enjoyable to drive. If you want  something bigger, there are several midsize hybrid sedans available including  the 2015 Ford Fusion Hybrid,  the 2015 Toyota Camry  Hybrid and the 2015  Honda Accord Hybrid. Each has their own virtues, but in general they all feel  more substantial and more like a normal car than the Prius. Overall, though,  the 2015 Toyota Prius deservedly remains a go-to choice for hybrid intenders.  The 2015 Toyota Prius is powered by a 1.8-liter  four-cylinder engine combined with a pair of electric motor/generators.  Together they send a total output of 134 horsepower to the front wheels through  a specialized continuously variable transmission (CVT).\nIn track testing, the Prius accelerated from zero to 60 mph  in 10.2 seconds; that's about the same as the Subaru XV Crosstrek Hybrid, but a  few seconds slower than the C-Max Hybrid and about three seconds slower than  most hybrid midsize sedans. The EPA  estimates that the 2015 Prius will return a very impressive 50 mpg combined (51 mpg city/48 highway). In real-world testing, we've found these estimates  reasonably accurate.  Every 2015 Toyota Prius comes standard with antilock disc brakes,  stability and traction control, front side airbags, side curtain airbags and a  driver knee airbag. A rearview camera is also standard.\nOptional on the Prius Four and Five is Toyota's Safety Connect emergency  communications system, which includes emergency and roadside assistance,  collision notification and stolen vehicle location. The Prius Five is also  eligible for the Advanced Technology package which includes a frontal-collision  warning system and a lane-departure warning system. \nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Prius came to a stop from 60  mph in 124 feet, which is a few feet longer than average.\nIn government crash tests, the Prius received four  stars (out of a possible five) for overall protection, with four stars for  frontal crash protection and five stars for side crash protection. The  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Prius the highest possible rating of  \"Good\" in its moderate-overlap frontal-offset impact test and a  second-best \"Acceptable\" rating for the small-overlap frontal-offset  impact test. The Prius received a \"Good\" score for the remaining side  impact, roof strength and whiplash protection (seats and head restraints) tests.  Acceleration in the Toyota Prius is far from sprightly, but  it should be adequate for most buyers. Four driving modes -- Normal, Eco, Power  and EV -- allow the driver to choose the optimum powertrain configuration  depending on conditions. Eco is measured and sluggish, but returns the best  fuel economy. Power is useful for entering freeways or driving on hills. EV  mode locks out the gasoline engine, but allows only a maximum speed of 25 mph  and requires at least a half-charged battery pack.\nAround town, the Prius is an easy-to-drive runabout. The  steering doesn't provide much feedback, but it makes the car effortless to  maneuver in parking lots without feeling overly light at highway speeds. The  ride is generally comfortable, but nastier bumps can upset the suspension and  disturb the car's occupants. There is also an excessive amount of road noise  that permeates the cabin regardless of speed. Moreover, the noises emitted by  the Prius' small gasoline engine under hard acceleration are not what we'd  describe as sonorous. The 2015 Toyota Prius features straightforward controls that  jut out toward the driver in a \"floating console\" that provides a  storage tray underneath. It's stylish and also helps maximize cabin space. The  digital instrument panel features a floating layer that displays audio,  temperature and trip computer information when the driver touches those  controls on the steering wheel, minimizing eye movement. Some drivers might  find the overall design a bit cluttered, however. Potentially more irksome though,  is the lack of useful range provided by the telescoping steering wheel, which  doesn't extend far enough to reach some drivers.\nThe standard touchscreen operates many of the Prius'  high-tech features and is, for the most part, smartly designed. The optional Entune system can be a hassle, though, since you have  to install an app on your phone and register for an account; plus, you always  need an active data connection to use it.\nMaterials quality in the Prius is also disappointing, with  harder and cheaper plastics than other cars in its price range. The  corduroylike texturing on the climate and audio controls seems nice at first,  but it collects oil from the skin and causes circular dark spots on most  buttons.\nHowever, the Prius remains highly versatile. The hatchback  body style provides considerably more cargo capacity than a typical midsize  sedan, and the backseat offers plenty of space for passengers. \nStandard equipment on the Prius Two includes 15-inch alloy  wheels, heated power mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, a rearview camera, cruise  control, automatic climate control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, cloth  upholstery, a height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split folding rear seat,  an advanced trip computer, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a 6.1-inch  touchscreen display and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, an  auxiliary audio jack and an iPod/USB audio interface.\nThe Prius Three gains an enhanced keyless entry system, a  navigation system, voice controls, satellite radio, HD radio and Toyota's Entune  system, which includes real-time information (traffic, weather, fuel prices,  sports scores) and the ability to use apps like Pandora, iHeart Radio and Open  Table via a connection with your smartphone.\nThe Persona Series gets the Three's equipment plus 17-inch  alloy wheels, additional chrome trim, side mirrors with integrated turn  signals, footwell illumination and leatherette upholstery.\nWith the Prius Four you get the Three's equipment as well as  automatic headlights, an eight-way power driver seat, heated front seats, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror and an eight-speaker JBL sound system.\nThe Prius Five adds unique 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights  and LED headlights.\nAn optional Solar Roof package for the Prius Three adds a  sunroof and a solar-powered ventilation system that keeps the car cool while  parked to limit the burden on the air-conditioning system. It's also offered  for the Four, and then includes a head-up display, Safety Connect emergency  communications and an upgraded navigation system with a 7-inch high-definition  display and split-screen capability.\nThe Five can be equipped with an Advanced Technology package,  which adds adaptive cruise control, a pre-collision alert system, a  lane-departure warning system, Safety Connect, a head-up display and the aforementioned  higher-quality navigation display.\nAlso available for the Prius are the Plus Appearance and  Plus Performance packages. The former adds 17-inch wheels and an aerodynamic  body kit while the latter package also features a sport-tuned suspension.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota Venza is unchanged for 2011. The 2011 Toyota Venza is hard to define, but whether you call it \"wagon\" or \"crossover,\" it's a competitive and comfortable family vehicle. It's a wagon. It's a crossover. It has cartoony 19-inch  dubs, yet has a ride your grandmother would like and a name she'd confuse with  a drug she saw advertised during Jeopardy! The 2011 Toyota Venza is a strange creation, one rife with contradictions and  difficult to properly define. There is one thing we're sure of, though; it  makes a great family vehicle.\nThe Venza has the basic body dimensions and interior space  of a midsize crossover SUV -- think Ford Edge or Nissan Murano -- but with one  significant exception: The Venza is nearly 4 inches shorter in height than its  rivals, and technically this puts it in the same camp as a wagon, not a  crossover. Its wagon-style dimensions also make the Venza feel more like a car  from behind the wheel compared to Toyota crossovers like the Highlander and  RAV4, although we certainly wouldn't call it athletic. Instead, like other  Toyotas, the Venza puts an emphasis on comfort and ease of driving.\nThe Venza's strange body style isn't the only thing that  stands out, however. Unlike with most midsize crossovers, the Venza features a  four-cylinder base engine. This provides sufficient power, but given that the  bigger V6 achieves similar fuel economy, it would be foolhardy to not at least  consider shelling out a few more bucks for the big engine. This is one of the  best -- and possibly the top -- V6s in the crossover class. If that weren't  incentive enough, going with the V6 gets you even bigger, 20-inch wheels. \nIn the front cabin, the Venza is filled with a variety of  innovative storage solutions. By placing the shift lever up high on the center  console, space opens up for several storage bins. You don't get the same sort  of versatility in back as you would in the more utilitarian RAV4, though. The  Venza's rear seat doesn't slide, it's not split three ways and there's no  option for a third row. The backseat does recline, but that's common among its  competitors.\nThat might be nitpicking, as would complaining that  interior-materials quality doesn't quite live up to the standards of the class  best. Certainly, the 2011 Toyota Venza is a strong contender whether you're in  the market for a wagon like the Subaru Outback or a midsize crossover like the 2011 Ford Edge, 2011 Nissan Murano and 2011 Chevrolet Equinox.  The Venza is also a more likable and stylish choice than the similarly  conceived 2011 Honda  Accord Crosstour. When a vehicle is such an indefinable oddity, it's bound  to draw comparisons to such a diverse range of vehicles, but against them all,  the Toyota Venza stands tall on its big wheels. The 2011 Toyota Venza is available with a four- or six-cylinder engine and can be had in either front- or all-wheel drive. All versions feature a six-speed automatic transmission. The 2.7-liter four-cylinder produces 182 horsepower and 182 pound-feet of torque. In Edmunds performance testing, a four-cylinder, front-drive Venza went from zero to 60 mph in 9.3 seconds -- an average time compared to similarly powered crossovers. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 21 mpg city/27 mpg highway and 23 mpg combined with front-wheel drive and 20/25/22 with all-wheel drive.\nThe 3.5-liter V6 produces 268 hp and 246 lb-ft of torque. In Edmunds performance testing, it accelerated an all-wheel-drive Venza from zero to 60 mph in a quick 6.9 seconds. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 19/26/22 with front drive and 18/25/21 with AWD. This is strong for a vehicle of its size and power. Every 2011 Toyota Venza comes standard with four-wheel antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag and front-seat active head restraints. In Edmunds brake testing, the Venza came to a stop from 60 mph in 122 feet regardless of engine.\nThe Venza has not been rated using the government's new, more strenuous 2011 crash-testing procedures. Its 2010 rating (which isn't comparable to 2011 ratings) was a perfect five stars in all frontal- and side-impact tests. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Venza its highest rating of \"Good\" in the frontal-offset, side and roof strength tests. It shouldn't come as a shock that the 2011 Toyota Venza is hardly a wagon in the ilk of sporty European models. Instead, like the Camry upon which it is based, the Venza is designed for comfort and ease of driving. Unlike the Camry, however, this crossover wagon gives the impression of being robust, with a more solid feel over bumps. The electric power steering also provides a bit more feedback than its sedan cousin, but it still feels pretty disconnected from the front wheels. Parking lot maneuvers couldn't be easier, however. Both engines provide ample power to move this sizable vehicle, although the V6 is obviously the way to go if passing folks on the highway takes precedence over achieving the best fuel economy. The 2011 Venza doesn't quite exhibit the top-notch interior quality of past Toyota models, but it is a tad nicer than its current Camry stablemate. Its design in particular is rather fetching and practical to boot, with a sleek center console that features a high-mounted shifter that frees up space between the seats. This allows for a large bin, generously sized cupholders and smaller bins perfect for iPods and other small devices. The audio and climate controls are a new design for Toyota, but they remain user-friendly.\nAlthough it lacks a third-row seat, the Venza provides loads of passenger space, particularly in the rear, which features reclining seatbacks. A bit more driver seat adjustment would be nice, though. The cargo area can swallow 70 cubic feet of stuff with the rear seat folded and a healthy 34.4 cubes with the seats up. These numbers put the Venza a smidgen ahead of the Ford Edge and just a bit behind the decidedly more utilitarian RAV4. \nThe availability of Toyota options and packages often depends on region, so check with your local dealer. Mostly grouped into packages, options include a rearview camera, a panoramic sunroof, xenon headlamps with automatic high beams, keyless ignition/entry, a four-way power passenger seat, heated front seats, leather upholstery, leather-wrapped wheel and shift knob and a 13-speaker JBL surround-sound audio system with a six-CD changer. To that JBL system can be added a navigation system (reduces the CD changer to four discs) and/or a rear-seat entertainment system.",

    "full_description": "Coming  off a full redesign last year, the 2021 Toyota Highlander broadens its lineup  with a new and sporty XSE model with a sport-tuned suspension. Most shoppers  seeking a three-row family SUV probably aren't looking for handling  performance, though, and the Highlander is already skilled in that area.  Otherwise, this three-row midsize SUV returns unchanged, with the same perks  and drawbacks as last year. \nWe  enjoy the Highlander's comfortable seats and ride quality, as well as its  potent V6 engine that comes standard. But this Toyota is held back by its  cramped third-row seating and smaller cargo space behind those seats. If cargo  space is a priority, it's worth checking out the impressive Kia Telluride (and  related Hyundai Palisade) as well as the Honda Pilot or Volkswagen Atlas. Still  interested? Check out our Expert Rating to get our in-depth take on the ups and  downs of the 2021 Highlander. Most  shoppers on a budget will be well served by the Highlander in LE trim, mainly for its addition of a  power liftgate and a blind-spot monitor. For those in harsh weather regions,  all-wheel drive is available throughout the lineup. If you have more room in  your budget, the XLE model looks and feels quite a bit nicer thanks to its  added convenience features and simulated leather upholstery. How does the Highlander drive? Unlike some SUVs that can be slow to respond when you first step on the accelerator, the Toyota Highlander delivers near immediate response. At our Edmunds test track we measured 0-60 mph at 7.5 seconds, which is slightly better than average and a dead heat with the top-rated Kia Telluride \u2014 though the Highlander feels a little quicker from the driver's seat. \n\n   The Highlander's ability to negotiate a twisty road has improved. Body roll is controlled as you go around turns, and the available torque-vectoring AWD system can also help by applying engine power to individual rear wheels to subtly enhance the SUV's handling balance (in addition to the usual benefit of extra traction in wet weather).\n\n   Despite all this advanced technology, the Highlander still feels like a bigger SUV. A number of competitors move with more purpose and lightness, and many are able to stop quicker in an emergency braking scenario. Ultimate performance aside, the Highlander makes daily driving a low-effort activity, which is most important. How comfortable is the Highlander? The Highlander's ride quality is pleasantly plush. Large and small road imperfections are smoothed over thanks to the compliant suspension, yet it avoids feeling floaty or disconnected at higher speeds. The front seats are quite comfortable even on long drives, and the available second-row captain's chairs deliver nearly the same amount of comfort. Alas, the third-row seats are one of the Highlander's greatest liabilities. Thin padding, a very low seat cushion and narrow space make them ill-suited for adults.\n\n   Wind noise is well silenced on the highway, and road noise is minimal. Our test Highlander did have a minor creak developing at the top of the driver's door. How\u2019s the interior? The first and second seating rows provide ample space, but the third row is one of the most confining in the midsize three-row SUV class. If you're planning on regularly using the full passenger capacity, you will be better served by rivals such as the Kia Telluride or Volkswagen Atlas. Once you're seated, it's easy to find your preferred driving position, but taller drivers may wish for a bit more extension range from the telescoping steering wheel. It can be a bit of a reach.\n\n   We give the Highlander high marks for outward visibility. The front roof pillars are thin, which help you see around turns. Some of the Highlander's available technology features help too, such as the camera-based rearview mirror that allows you to see out the back even if you've fully loaded up the rear cargo area. The available surround-view camera system is sharp and can be rotated to \"look around\" the vehicle. How\u2019s the tech? In recent years, Toyota has trailed other manufacturers when it comes to tech. This latest-generation Highlander makes big strides in the right direction, but it still has some drawbacks. The optional 12.3-inch touchscreen is huge (an 8-inch screen is standard) and it responds quickly to inputs, but the reflections on the surface make using it more difficult than it should be. Our Highlander Platinum test vehicle had five USB charge ports for the first and second rows but none for the third row.\n\n   Toyota provides a comprehensive suite of advanced driver aids as standard on all Highlanders. Among other things, we like the adaptive cruise control, but we found the lane departure warning slightly too sensitive in the normal mode and not sensitive enough in the low mode. How\u2019s the storage? Cargo space is a bit of a mixed bag with the Highlander. Behind the third row, there's only 16 cubic feet of space, which is small for the class. Behind the second row, it expands to a better-than-average 48.4 cubic feet. The liftover height is about average for a midsize SUV. \n\n   As for cabin storage, there are good-size pockets and cupholders, as well as two shelves built into the dash (one has a clever phone cable keeper too). Because the wireless phone charger is in the center armrest bin, you have to flip it up to access the space underneath, which some might find inconvenient.\n\n   Got kids? A large rear-facing car seat will easily be accommodated in the second row thanks to the generous amount of fore/aft movement of the available captain's chairs. The car seat anchors are also easy to locate and access for all types of child safety seats, though there are no anchors in the third row. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates the all-wheel-drive Highlander returns 23 mpg (20 city/27 highway) and a slightly better 24 mpg (21 city/29 highway) for front-wheel-drive models. This may not seem like a huge advantage over the competition with a difference of just 1 or 2 mpg, but it's significant for this class of vehicle.\n\n   On our 115-mile highway-heavy evaluation route, we achieved 24.7 mpg, which indicates to us the EPA's estimates should be achievable. Of note, the Highlander Hybrid is estimated to return 36 mpg combined. Is the Highlander a good value? In general, the Highlander is a little more expensive than its closest rivals, and you don't quite get as many standard features. When it comes to quality, the interior materials are only about average when compared to what's used in the top-rated SUVs in this class.\n\n   Toyota's warranty coverage is pretty common for the class with three years/36,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage and five years/60,000 miles for the powertrain. Toyota provides the first two years of scheduled maintenance for free. The new styling up front gives the Highlander more of an industrial, truck-like appearance, which is pleasing. The same can't be said of the Supra-inspired character line that goes from the bottom of the front door and over the rear wheels. \n\n   One thing that helps boost this score is the Highlander's composure on a twisting road. We might even say it's fun to drive for a midsize three-row SUV.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota Sequoia is unchanged for 2017. The 2017 Toyota Sequoia is worth a look if a traditional three-row SUV is in your future. Though it lacks some of the latest tech and safety features, its seating for eight, legitimate off-road and towing capabilities, and substantial cargo room make it a capable rig for doing just about anything.  The current generation Sequoia has been around for nine years now without a redesign. That's a long time in the automotive industry, and it's mostly apparent in the Sequoia's dated infotainment system and lack of the latest driver safety aids such as lane departure warning and forward collision mitigation. And in general, know that other big crossover SUVs can provide similar amounts of interior room to the Sequoia but with superior fuel economy and a better combination of ride comfort and secure handling.  But as traditional SUVs go, the Sequoia still offers a more comfortable ride than many in its class, especially when equipped with the Platinum trim's air suspension. It's also pretty capable off-road thanks to its substantial ground clearance, though obviously this isn't a vehicle you'll want to try to squeeze down a tight, narrow trail. Overall, the Sequoia isn't our top pick for a big three-row SUV, but there are enough positives that it's worth considering. The 2017 Toyota Sequoia is worth a look if a traditional three-row SUV is in your future. Though it lacks some of the latest tech and safety features, its seating for eight, legitimate off-road and towing capabilities, and substantial cargo room make it a capable rig for doing just about anything. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2013 Toyota Sequoia Platinum (5.7L V8; 4x4; 6-speed automatic). NOTE: Since this test was conducted, the current Toyota Sequoia has received some revisions, including a sunroof and a rearview camera added to the standard equipment list in 2015 and upgrades to the infotainment system in 2016. But our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Toyota Sequoia. For a big three-ton SUV, the Sequoia is no slouch. The 5.7-liter V8 is willing, clocking a 0-60 mph sprint in 6.9 seconds. There's always power in reserve, and the six-speed automatic transmission is smooth. The Sequoia is well-controlled during panic stops, with reasonably short distances, considering its weight. But the brake pedal felt long and soft in normal driving around town. Steering responsiveness is better in the Sequoia than your average big SUV, but it's still not what we'd call tight or precise. It could use a bit more feel. Even in its sportiest setting, the Sequoia felt soft and sloppy during aggressive maneuvers, though it's not so noticeable on a mountain road. There's quite a bit of body roll, too. For the most part the Sequoia is easy to drive, with light steering and a smooth-shifting automatic. But the gas pedal's responsiveness is more abrupt than we would like. The low-range transfer case makes the Sequoia capable in true off-road conditions, as does its substantial 10 inches of ground clearance. However, its large size will keep it off tight trails. What's the sign of a good seat? You don't think about its comfort while driving. The leather is slippery, though, and there's zero lateral support. The door armrests could be softer. The ride is generally plush, especially with the three-mode suspension set to Comfort. Although soft, it's not so pillowy that you're completely isolated as a driver from the road. The Sequoia is very quiet, especially considering this is a truck-based SUV. You can hear the V8 lumbering on the highway, but there's almost no tire noise. Even wind noise is reduced to just a whisper. The center stack is composed of a smattering of buttons and knobs, but most are easy to decipher. The cupholders are too far of a reach on the center console. The same goes for the stereo, which requires a stretch to press the virtual buttons accurately. Getting into the Sequoia's front seats require a step up, but the grab handles on the front pillar help. The second-row seats are even easier. Third-row entry is fairly simple due to the second row's tilt-and-slide function. There's plenty of headroom and elbow and shoulder room up front. Captain's chairs for the second row give mega-space all around. The three seats in the third row are not wide enough to comfortably seat adults, but they should be fine for short trips if needed. The windshield is not actually all that tall for a big SUV. Large pillars behind the front seat occupants block the back and side view, especially on the driver side. The standard backup camera is greatly appreciated. The quality and feel of cabin materials are outclassed by what you'll find in many of the Sequoia's newer rivals. The cabin is filled with hard-touch plastics, and it was disheartening that our tester's 4WD selector knob spun freely. There are plenty of storage bins throughout the cabin, even way back in the third row. The center console bin is large, and 16 cupholders are spread throughout the cabin. Cargo space is impressive for the class. Behind the first row is 120.1 cubic feet of space, compared to the Chevrolet Tahoe's and Nissan Armada's roughly 95 cubic feet. Only the Chevrolet Suburban and Ford Expedition EL are similarly sized. The Sequoia has a max towing capacity of 7,000 pounds for the Platinum 4WD model and 7,200 pounds for the RWD Platinum version. You can tow up to 7,400 pounds in the less luxurious RWD SR5 model. The base Sequoia SR5 is well-equipped as is, and the reasonably priced Premium package adds most of the extras, such as leather seating surfaces and navigation, we'd want in a large SUV. However, it might be easier to just go with the Limited, which gets those extras as standard, plus a power liftgate and the option for blind-spot monitoring. Upgrading to the Platinum is fairly expensive, so only consider it if you absolutely need the extra luxury features or if you tow frequently because it comes with a load-leveling air suspension.  The base SR5 model comes stocked with a healthy amount of standard features. Highlights include a 5.7-liter V8 (381 horsepower, 401 pound-feet of torque), a six-speed automatic transmission, 18-inch wheels, a sunroof, a power rear window, tri-zone automatic climate control, a power driver seat, a 40/20/40-split second-row bench seat (with sliding and reclining functionality), a 60/40-split reclining and fold-flat third-row bench, second- and third-row side sunshades, a rearview camera, a 6.1-inch touchscreen and an eight-speaker audio system. An optional Sport package gets you 20-inch wheels, a color-keyed grille and second-row captain's chairs (reducing seating capacity to seven). The separately available SR5 Premium package retains eight-passenger seating and bundles an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather upholstery, a power passenger seat, heated front seats, a power-reclining and -folding third-row seat, and an integrated navigation system.  Stepping up to the Limited model gets you 20-inch wheels, power-folding and auto-dimming exterior mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, and a power liftgate. Inside, everything from the SR5's Premium package is included as standard, along with upgraded gauges. The Safety and Convenience option package adds blind-spot monitoring and driver-seat memory functions. A 14-speaker JBL sound system is optional, as is a rear-seat entertainment system with a Blu-ray player. The top-of-the-line Platinum trim level comes standard with all of the above features, plus an adaptive air suspension (with a load-leveling rear), adaptive cruise control, ventilated front seats, heated second-row captain's chairs (reducing seating capacity to seven), a second-row center console and a power-adjustable steering wheel.",

    "full_description": "For 2011, the Toyota Sienna has been completely redesigned. Changes include a new entry-level four-cylinder version as well as a sport-tuned (yes, we're serious) SE trim level. Roomy, comfortable, well-built and offered in several different flavors, the 2011 Toyota Sienna minivan is an excellent choice for larger families.Notably, we picked the 2011 Toyota Sienna as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars, Trucks and SUVs. Despite the popularity of crossover SUVs, the minivan  remains the king of family vehicles. Let's face it: The minivan's boxy shape is  the best for maximizing passenger and cargo space within a given footprint, and  its dual sliding rear doors make entry and exit super-easy. And to spark more  interest in this function-over-form segment, there's the redesigned 2011 Toyota  Sienna.\nThe newest Sienna is virtually the same size as the outgoing  version, and as before it can seat seven or eight passengers and has available  all-wheel drive -- a Sienna exclusive. But there are a number of significant  changes for 2011. Among them are the debut of a four-cylinder engine, a new  six-speed automatic transmission, available recliner-style seating for the  second row and a new split-screen video monitor for the rear seat entertainment  system.\nThose on a tighter budget who are also looking for max fuel  economy may want to consider the new four-cylinder base and LE trims. On the  other side of the spectrum is the new Sienna SE, which comes with a sport-tuned  suspension as well as styling tweaks that include lower skirting and a larger  lower grille. What hasn't changed much is the Sienna's basic and likable  character, which means a smooth, quiet ride, easy handling, comfortable seating  and plenty of family-friendly features. And based on its strong record, we  assume the Sienna will likely provide many miles of low-maintenance and  trouble-free transportation.\nStill, the Sienna has its age-old rival, the 2011 Honda Odyssey, vying  for minivan supremacy. Previously, the Honda had the advantage in driving  enjoyment with its superior steering feel and relatively agile handling, making  it the choice for driving enthusiasts in need of practical family wheels. Now,  however, Toyota offers the Sienna SE to appeal to that same consumer. The  Sienna also has a quieter ride and continues to offer the option of all-wheel  drive. The latter is an exclusive option for the 2011 Toyota Sienna, and gives  it added appeal to those who live in inclement climates.\nAnother consideration is the value-packed 2011 Kia Sedona, which may  not offer quite the same refinement in the cabin, but boasts solid performance  and plenty of features for quite a bit less than the two stalwarts. Though the  Chrysler-derived minivans (Grand Caravan, Town & Country and VW Routan)  offer attractive styling and features, their build-quality problems and an antiquated  base engine prevent us from recommending them. This sets the minivan market as  a three-horse race. The Toyota is certainly the newest and has a lot going for  it, but you'll also want to check out the Honda and Kia to determine which minivan  best suits your needs.  Base and LE models come with a 2.7-liter inline-4 that makes 187 horsepower. Available on those two trims and standard on all others is a 265-hp 3.5-liter V6. Both engines come matched to a six-speed automatic transmission. The Sienna LE, XLE and Limited V6 models can also be had with all-wheel drive.We timed the V6 (in front-drive Limited trim) from zero to 60 mph in a swift 7.9 seconds. The EPA fuel economy estimates come in at 19 mpg city/26 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined for the four-cylinder/front-wheel-drive models, with the V6/front-wheel-drive versions earning estimates of 18/24/20 and V6/AWD rating 16/22/18. Antilock disc brakes, stability control, traction control, a windshield de-icer and a full complement of airbags (including driver knee, front-seat side and full-length side curtain) are standard on all 2011 Toyota Sienna models. The LE adds a rearview camera (with the monitor integrated into the rearview mirror).\nThe Limited also comes with front and rear park assist; it's optional on the XLE. If you opt for the navigation system, you'll also get a wider-range (180-degree) rearview camera that uses the large screen of the nav system as the monitor. At the test track, a Sienna Limited stopped from 60 mph in 127 feet -- about average for the minivan segment -- with a solid, confident brake pedal feel.\nIn the government's new, more strenuous crash testing for 2011, the Sienna earned an overall rating of four stars out of a possible five, with three stars for overall frontal crash protection and five stars for overall side crash protection. In tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Sienna earned a top score of \"Good\" for its performance in frontal-offset, side-impact and roof-strength impacts.\n Equipped with the V6, the 2011 Toyota Sienna offers truly spirited performance, just as we've come to expect from this jewel of a power plant. This year's new alternative, the 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine, is a smooth and fairly quiet operator, and it has enough punch to deal with traffic and freeway cruising with two people aboard. But when faced with steeper inclines, quick merging or a full load of passengers, it has to work harder and the thrust quickly tapers off. The smart six-speed automatic does a great job at keeping the four-cylinder lively, but the downside of this powertrain is that the fuel economy isn't that much different from the V6's.The Sienna's ride quality is plush, and handling is competent in all versions. The SE, due to its recalibrated suspension, provides more agile handling with a somewhat firmer (though still comfortable) ride quality. The steering is typical Toyota, meaning precise if somewhat numb, though the SE offers a meatier feel in the wheel.\nRead our Toyota Sienna Long-Term 20,000-Mile Test The Sienna's cabin is handsomely fitted with high-quality fabric on the lower trim levels and leather and somewhat unconvincing faux wood on the higher-end models. Some of the plastics, however, strike us as odd and downmarket, such as the purposely rough-textured plastic on the dash. The various controls are simple to use, storage space is plentiful and the seats are plush. The available rear seat entertainment system has a new split-screen monitor that can allow two different media (e.g. a movie on one side and a video game on the other) to be shown simultaneously.Seven-passenger Siennas feature second-row captain's chairs that tip up to allow easier access to the third row. They also have a long-slide feature to maximize legroom for taller passengers. However, those seats do require a fair amount of effort to slide, and removing them is a job best left to two people, as they are rather heavy and awkward. The eight-passenger version uses a 40/20/40-split second-row bench whose center section slides close to the front seats for easier access to the little one seated there.Models fitted with the lounge seats offer La-Z-Boy-style comfort to those in the second row, provided those seats are slid back far enough (and the front seats are up far enough) to allow the footrests to come up all the way. With the second-row seats out and the third row stowed, the Sienna provides a massive 150 cubic feet of maximum cargo capacity. The base Sienna includes 17-inch alloy wheels, dual sliding rear doors with power-down windows, triple-zone air-conditioning, full power accessories, a telescoping steering wheel, cruise control and a four-speaker CD/MP3 stereo with an auxiliary audio jack. The four-cylinder LE adds privacy glass, heated side mirrors, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, a 3.5-inch display (includes a back-up monitor), floor and overhead consoles and an 8-way (manual) driver seat. The LE V6 adds a roof rack, power-sliding side doors, auto-dimming rearview mirror, power lumbar supports (front seats), second- and third-row sunshades, Bluetooth and a six-speaker audio system (with satellite radio, a USB jack, iPod connectivity and Bluetooth audio).The sport-themed SE is equipped similarly to the LE V6 but adds more aggressive styling via 19-inch alloy wheels, a unique front fascia (with foglights, mesh inserts and a larger air intake), lower body skirting and tinted head- and taillights. Inside the SE are leatherette/cloth upholstery, unique instruments and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. The audio system, however, is essentially the base unit with six speakers.The Sienna XLE features a unique metallic gray grille insert, a power liftgate, a sunroof, a tow prep package, triple-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, wood grain interior trim, a power driver seat, heated front seats and auto-up/down power windows. The AWD version of the XLE also comes with second-row lounge seats that feature pop-up footrests.The plush Limited features 18-inch alloy wheels, a satin chrome grille, power-folding side mirrors (with auto-dimming, signal repeaters and puddle lamps), dual sunroofs, keyless ignition/entry, two-tone leather seating, driver memory settings, a leather-and-wood steering wheel, an upgraded 10-speaker JBL surround-sound audio system, second-row lounge seats and a power-folding/split third-row seat.Options on the Toyota Sienna are grouped into packages that vary based on trim level and buying region. Notable highlights include xenon headlights, rain-sensing wipers, adaptive cruise control, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system (with a large screen that can be split to display two different sources) and a navigation system (with a back-up camera).",

    "full_description": "For 2013, the Toyota 4Runner returns with no significant changes. For the relatively few drivers who require an all-conquering all-terrain SUV, the 2013 Toyota 4Runner is a top choice. In  every crowd there's always a contrarian who ignores the conventional wisdom and  stubbornly goes his own way. In the midsize SUV segment, that would be the 2013  Toyota 4Runner.\nIn  an era when virtually all of its competitors have made the switch to kinder,  gentler car-based platforms, the midsize 4Runner has remained true to its  rugged roots. Though much has changed in the nearly 30 years since its  introduction, the 4Runner retains the traditional body-on-frame underpinnings  that give it a robust off-road capability that's increasingly hard to find.\nJust  because its basic layout remains the same, however, that doesn't mean the 4Runner  is some kind of four-wheeled anachronism. Its 270-horsepower V6 engine has more  than enough guts to keep up with the latest generation of car-based crossovers  while still returning decent fuel economy numbers. It has a roomy interior with  plenty of cargo space and the potential to carry seven passengers. And as if to  prove this is no old-school SUV, it has a number of high-tech features  including an emergency telematics system and Toyota's Entune electronics  interface.\nYet  there's plenty of old-school off-roader here, too. The 4Runner's two different  four-wheel-drive systems with low range and locking center and/or rear  differentials give it the ability to go where most of its competitors rightly  fear to tread. There's also the KDSS dynamic suspension system that features  electronically disconnecting sway bars for improved wheel travel, and Crawl  Control that allows the driver to concentrate on choosing the correct line  through tough off-pavement sections while the computer takes charge of the  throttle and brake.\nWhile  the 4Runner has a number of points in its favor, it's not right for everybody.  Buyers looking for similar off-road capability with more guts under the hood  will want to check out the V8-powered 2013 Jeep Grand  Cherokee, which also  offers a more upscale interior.\nAnd  if you're one of the many SUV buyers who aren't likely to venture very far off  the pavement, you'll want to consider some of those car-based crossover SUVs.  Top choices would include the 2013 Nissan Pathfinder  and Toyota's own Highlander. Still, the 2013 Toyota 4Runner offers something  that's downright uncommon these days, namely the ability for those folks who  don't like to follow the crowd to blaze their own trail. The  2013 Toyota 4Runner comes standard with a 4.0-liter V6 engine that produces 270  hp and 278 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed automatic is the only available  transmission.\nRear-wheel  drive is standard on SR5 and Limited models. The SR5 trim level can also be had  with an available part-time four-wheel-drive system with low range, while the  Limited offers optional full-time four-wheel drive with a lockable center differential.  The Trail model comes standard with the part-time low-range-equipped  four-wheel-drive system and includes a locking rear differential and selectable  electronic terrain-sensitive systems. Regardless of model or drivetrain, the  4Runner's towing capacity is rated at 5,000 pounds.\nIn  Edmunds instrumented testing, a rear-drive 4Runner SR5 accelerated from a  standstill to 60 mph in 7.2 seconds (8.2 seconds for a four-wheel-drive Trail  model), which is about average among competing SUVs. The EPA estimates fuel  economy at 17 mpg city/23 mpg highway and 19 mpg combined for a  rear-wheel-drive 4Runner, which is also average in this segment. With  four-wheel drive, those numbers drop to 17/21/18. Standard  safety features on the 2013 Toyota 4Runner include antilock disc brakes,  stability and traction control, front-seat side airbags, full-length side  curtain airbags, front knee airbags and active front head restraints. The  Limited comes with the Safety Connect emergency communications system, which  includes automatic collision notification, a stolen-vehicle locator and  roadside assistance.\nIn  Edmunds brake testing, a rear-wheel-drive 4Runner SR5 came to a stop from 60  mph in 122 feet, which is average among SUVs in its class. However, a Trail  model with its off-road-oriented tires consumed 140 feet to come to a  standstill.\nIn  government crash tests the 4Runner earned an overall rating of four stars (out  of a possible five) along with four stars in frontal crash protection and five  stars in side impact protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety  awarded the 4Runner its top rating of \"Good\" for both frontal-offset  and side-impact protection and a second best \"Acceptable\" in the roof  strength test. From  behind the steering wheel the 2013 Toyota 4Runner displays a level of  refinement you might not expect from a truck-based SUV. The V6 engine is strong  enough that it's unlikely the lack of a V8 option will be an issue for most  buyers. The ride is also smooth and well-controlled, with hardly a trace of the  bounciness once common to vehicles with this level of off-road capability. \nOn  the pavement, the 4Runner's handling is not particularly impressive. The  steering feels less communicative than we'd like, but its light effort works  well in both slow-speed parking lot maneuvers and off-road, where it results in  reduced kickback on gnarly trails. Speaking of its performance in the dirt, the  4Runner is one of the best in its class, especially if it's the Trail model  equipped with Toyota's KDSS suspension system, which allows for a greater range  of wheel travel. The  2013 Toyota 4Runner offers an interior that's as straightforward as the rest of  the vehicle. Its utilitarian DNA can be seen in the expanses of hard plastics  (or maybe it's just penny pinching), but either way, key points of contact at  least get some welcome padding. Controls are simple and easy to use, though the  large climate controls knobs don't feel very substantial. Toyota's Entune  system, which is standard on Limited models and available as an option on both  the SR5 and Trail, integrates with the driver's smartphone to enable the use of  handy apps like Pandora or OpenTable through the dash's touchscreen interface.\nAs  for passenger accommodations, the standard five-person seating arrangement  includes a reclining 40/20/40-split-folding second-row seat. The available  third-row seat bumps capacity to seven passengers, but is cramped enough that  no one over the age of about 14 will want to spend much time there.\nThere's  a healthy 47 cubic feet of cargo room behind the second-row seats, a number  that jumps to an even healthier 90 cubic feet with all the rear seats folded  down. That's about the same as crossovers like the Ford Explorer and Nissan  Pathfinder. The cargo hold also has a couple of clever features including a  sliding rear cargo floor with a 440-pound capacity and a Party Mode that shifts  the audio system's output to the speakers in the liftgate to provide tunes for  tailgate parties. \nThe  entry-level SR5 comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, skid plates,  hill-start assist and hill descent control, foglights, heated mirrors, rear  privacy glass, a power-lowering liftgate window, a windshield wiper de-icer, keyless  entry, cruise control, air-conditioning with second-row vents, cloth  upholstery, a height-adjustable driver seat (with power lumbar adjustment), a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, 40/20/40-split-folding and reclining rear  seats, a trip computer, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity and an  eight-speaker sound system with a CD player, satellite radio, an auxiliary  audio jack and an iPod/USB audio interface.\nThe  Trail model adds off-road-oriented tires, extensive off-roading mechanical  elements, mud guards, black exterior trim, a sunroof, power front seats  (eight-way driver, four-way passenger), water-resistant cloth upholstery, a  rearview camera, a sliding rear cargo floor, upgraded gauges and two 120-volt  household power outlets. The Trail can be equipped with the optional KDSS  off-road suspension.\nThe  Limited includes the Trail's interior upgrades plus 20-inch alloy wheels,  adaptive suspension, automatic headlights, keyless ignition/entry, dual-zone  automatic climate control, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, HD radio, a touchscreen audio interface and Toyota's Entune  smartphone integration system.\nMany  of the features found on the 4Runner Trail and Limited models are available as  options on the lower trim levels, though specifics will vary based on the  region of the United States in which you live. Other option highlights include  a voice-activated navigation system and automatically deploying/retracting  running boards (not available on Trail). ",

    "full_description": "The Toyota RAV4 carries over unchanged for 2008. Spacious, comfortable and easy to drive, the 2008 Toyota RAV4 is a top pick for a small SUV, especially if you want a V6 or a usable kid-size third-row seat. An engine can make or break a car. That's rather obvious since without cylinders pumping under the hood, a car is nothing but an expensive lawn ornament. But in the case of the 2008 Toyota RAV4, its optional V6 engine catapults this otherwise competent compact- to medium-sized crossover SUV to the top of its class. Not only does the 269-horsepower six-cylinder provide excellent acceleration, it gets about the same fuel economy as four-cylinder-equipped competitors putting out 100 fewer horses -- including the four-cylinder RAV4. More power without more consumption is always a recipe for success.The vehicle surrounding that engine is a model of user-friendly transportation. Though previous generations of the Toyota RAV4 were petite, the third-generation RAV has ballooned to offer a huge 73 cubic feet of cargo space (more than the midsize Ford Edge, for example) and ample space for five passengers. A third-row seat provides room for two children, or possibly small adults with a high threshold for cramped spaces. There are also plenty of family-friendly cubbies, cupholders (10, to be exact) and other features like an available rear-seat DVD entertainment system.Even with its boffo V6, the 2008 Toyota RAV4 still isn't the most involving crossover to drive. As such, driving enthusiasts might prefer a Mazda CX-7 or Saturn Vue Red Line. Otherwise, the V6-powered RAV4 is hard to beat for families in search of a vehicle that offers plenty of space, features and value (both at buying time and at the pump). The four-cylinder RAV4 isn't quite as attractive. Unless you really need a third-row seat, the Honda CR-V is a more well-rounded, versatile and luxurious choice. And although they don't offer the same space and/or fuel economy, the Nissan Rogue, Mitsubishi Outlander, Saturn Vue and Hyundai Santa Fe are also worthy of a look. The 2008 RAV4 comes standard with 2.4-liter four-cylinder that delivers 166 hp and 165 pound-feet of torque. A four-speed automatic transmission is standard. Revised fuel economy figures for this engine with front-wheel drive are 21 mpg city and 27 mpg highway, while the four-wheel-drive model gets a 20/25 mpg rating.Optional on all trim levels and coupled to a five-speed automatic transmission is a 3.5-liter V6 that produces an impressive 269 hp and 246 lb-ft of torque. This powertrain gets almost the same fuel economy as the much less powerful four-cylinder, with 19 mpg city and 27 mpg highway. Getting four-wheel drive results in a loss of only 1 mpg on the highway. In performance testing, the RAV4 V6 4WD delivered a very quick 0-60-mph time of 7.2 seconds.All RAV4s can be equipped with either front- or four-wheel drive. Front-drive models have a limited-slip differential, while the electronic 4WD system sends most of the power to the front wheels until it identifies potential slippage. Unlike many competitor vehicles, the RAV4 offers a true 4WD lock feature that fixes the front/rear power split 50/50, which is useful for driving in snow and light off-roading. Antilock disc brakes, stability control, traction control, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags are standard on every 2008 Toyota RAV4. Vehicles equipped with the V6 and/or the optional third-row seat also come with hill-start assist and downhill assist control. In crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the RAV4 earned a perfect five stars for driver protection in frontal impacts and four stars for the front passenger. It earned five stars for front- and rear-occupant protection in side impacts. Toyota's small SUV performed well in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests as well, earning the top rating of \"Good\" in both the frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. Although plenty capable off the beaten path, the 2008 Toyota RAV4 is meant for and succeeds at a life on pavement. Its taut suspension and quick electric steering (that can nevertheless feel a little vague) make daily errands much more enjoyable than they would be in most SUVs. The RAV is not as athletic as the Mazda CX-7 or Honda CR-V, but in trade, the Toyota offers a smooth ride that's forgiving enough for commuters who drive on crumbling expressways. Road noise can be an issue at times, but wind noise is well controlled.If we were to buy a RAV4, it would have to come with the optional V6. Despite having 100-plus more horses than the CR-V and four-cylinder RAV4, V6-equipped RAVs manage to get almost the same fuel economy. The four-cylinder is a reasonable choice for most buyers, as it provides adequate power for day-to-day driving, but when equipped with this engine, the RAV doesn't fare as well against its competitors that offer similar power, gas mileage and space.Read our Toyota RAV4 Long-Term 20,000-Mile Test Inside, the RAV4 has a clean design with large, simple controls and lots of storage space. The cabin isn't as plasticky as previous-generation RAV4s, but it still has a budget feel compared to competitors like the CR-V, Rogue and Santa Fe. Nevertheless, the Toyota offers a highly practical design. The rear seats recline, and can slide forward or rearward 6.5 inches to optimize passenger space or cargo capacity. Normal seating capacity is five, while the optional third-row seat bumps it to seven. Though this seat is meant only for children, it is at least reasonably sturdy and spacious.To configure the RAV4 for cargo, all one has to do is flip a lever to instantly get a flat load floor -- no need to remove headrests or fold up seat cushions. With its flat load floor, the RAV4 can hold a maximum of 73 cubic feet of cargo. The load floor is also quite low for this class, and minimizes the strain of loading a week's worth of groceries. The Toyota's side-hinged tailgate can be an inconvenience when you're parked on the street, though, as it opens away from the curb. Standard features for the base RAV4 include 16-inch steel wheels (17-inch alloys are optional), rear tinted windows, full power accessories, keyless entry, cruise control, a tilt-telescoping steering wheel and a six-speaker stereo with CD/MP3 player and auxiliary audio jack. The Sport adds 18-inch alloy wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, foglights, heated side mirrors and several exterior details. The range-topping Limited trim includes 17-inch wheels for a smoother ride, dual-zone automatic climate control, an eight-way power driver seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and an in-dash six-CD changer (optional on the two lower trims).Options available on the Limited trim include leather upholstery, heated front seats and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system. Optional on the Limited and Sport trims is a sunroof and upgraded nine-speaker stereo system with satellite radio capability and Bluetooth. Toyota packages these options together, but those packages' exact content and availability varies based on region.",

    "full_description": "For the 2006 Toyota Camry, the navigation system is now available as a stand-alone option on the SE V6. The Camry's stated power ratings are also a bit lower this year due to Toyota's implementation of a new SAE engine testing procedure. It won't win any design awards or run circles around its competitors, but when it comes to practicality, value and refinement, few midsize sedans can top the 2006 Toyota Camry. When it comes to midsize family sedans, there are few cars more well-known than the Toyota Camry. A huge success in the United States, the Camry appeals to buyers because of its comfort, safety and value. It has been, and still is, the \"safe\" choice in the family sedan class. Buy the Toyota Camry and you can rest assured that it will do little wrong and provide years of faithful service. The Camry was last redesigned in 2002. Compared to the previous-generation Toyota car, this Camry features bolder styling, larger interior packaging, better performance, reduced noise and more safety features. It's an excellent vehicle and fulfills its mission of providing an incredibly comfortable, easygoing ride. A common complaint over the years is that the Toyota Camry lacks panache. Just compare it to some of the latest competing sedans, and you'll see that it does indeed impart a bit of a snooze response in regards to style and performance. But if these things don't matter much to you, well, you'll do just fine. As usual, the Camry's closest competitor is the Accord. Both are targeted toward the same type of buyer and both have similar levels of style, comfort and features. Pushed to making a decision, we'd probably suggest the Accord as it seems to be a better overall package for the money. But if you choose the 2006 Toyota Camry, you'll know you ended up with a great car that is well suited to today's modern American family. Three engines are available on this Toyota car. The first is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder that makes 154 horsepower (145 with PZEV emission controls). It's mated to either a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission, and should be powerful enough for the majority of buyers. A 3.0-liter V6 that generates 190 hp is also available on the LE and XLE, while a 210-hp, 3.3-liter V6 is available on the SE model only. Six-cylinder Camrys come with the automatic only. Antilock brakes are standard on all 2006 Toyota Camry models. Optional on all models are front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags. Stability control is available on V6 models. In NHTSA crash tests, the Toyota Camry earned a perfect five stars for frontal-impact protection. Side-impact testing resulted in a four-star rating for front-occupant protection (without side airbags) and a three-star rating for the rear. In IIHS frontal-offset testing, the Camry earned a \"Good\" rating (the highest possible) and was named a \"Best Pick.\" In IIHS side-impact tests, the Camry received a \"Good\" rating (the highest) when equipped with the optional side airbags (without the bags, it rated \"Poor\"). Toyota didn't design the Camry to be particularly sporty (for that, check out the Camry Solara). Instead, it focused on giving this car a smooth and quiet ride that makes daily commutes a painless chore. Power from the four-cylinder engine is average for this class, but it's delivered in such a refined fashion that only those who demand above-average acceleration are likely to complain. Same goes for the V6 engines, though the more powerful SE V6 has no trouble hanging with the competition. The Camry's interior offers excellent build quality, high-quality materials and a straightforward design that won't leave you thumbing through the owner's manual to figure out where everything is located. Additionally, the 2006 Toyota Camry boasts competitive amounts of head-, leg- and shoulder room, including the roomiest backseat of any midsize family sedan. The optional navigation system is one of the best around with simple controls and a large, easy-to-read screen. The 2006 Toyota Camry sedan is available in Standard, LE, SE and XLE trims. The entry-level Standard offers basics such as power locks and windows, cruise control and a CD player, but has limited option availability. The LE adds upgrades like keyless entry, a power driver seat and color-keyed exterior mirrors. The sporty SE is similarly equipped, but features different interior trim and upholstery, a sport-tuned suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, foglamps and a unique grille. Step up to the XLE and you get automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, upgraded audio system and, on the XLE V6, leather seating. Various options include a sunroof, leather seating, heated front seats, a DVD-based navigation system and an in-dash CD changer",

    "full_description": "The  2019 Toyota Highlander is your quintessential three-row family mover. With  comfortable seating, plenty of standard safety features, a strong V6 engine and  an impeccable reputation for reliability, the Highlander checks all the boxes  for large families in motion. Thanks to its just-right size, the Highlander is  also easy to maneuver around town and does so at near-luxury levels of quiet  and comfort.  But  the Highlander isn't flawless. Its third-row seat and cargo area aren't  especially voluminous, and its infotainment system, while fine, doesn't offer  Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration. The base four-cylinder  engine is also pretty gutless, but at least the V6 that comes in most  Highlanders is respectably stout. It  might be worth your while to look at some rival crossover SUVs. The Honda Pilot  and the Volkswagen Atlas are roomier, for instance, and the Mazda CX-9 provides  a more upscale and energetic driving experience. Overall, however, the popular  Highlander has what it takes to satisfy the majority of your family-hauling  needs. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the Toyota Highlander XLE (3.5L V6 |  8-speed automatic | AWD). Toyota makes a solid V6 engine. Mash the gas and the 3.5-liter V6 screams (almost too loudly) to life. Midrange power is commendable and good for passing and merging. Roll into the gas slowly, however, and the engine doesn't feel fully awake. It'll hit 60 mph in 7.9 seconds, which is about middle of the pack. The brake pedal engages with minimal effort. Responsiveness is predictable and progressive. In Edmunds' panic-stop brake test, our Highlander XLE slowed from 60 mph to a stop in 128 feet. That's an average distance for a three-row SUV. There is considerable free play in the steering wheel at low speeds. This vague communication takes getting used to. The super-light effort, however, certainly helps when parking a vehicle of these dimensions. The effort gets a bit heavier at speed, offering a greater sense of stability and control. The Highlander fits the classic big-and-boaty mold of large SUVs. It drives big in parking lots, though the low-effort steering alleviates some of the stress. When going around turns, the Highlander doesn't maintain its composure as well as the top players in the segment. Opt for straighter roads when possible. The conservative gas pedal's response time is slow and can get annoying. Transmission shifts are otherwise smooth, and midrange power is commendable. Driver assist features are tuned conservatively, making for a generally laid-back driving demeanor. Ground clearance is listed at 8 inches, which exceeds that of most in the segment. You also get above-average approach and departure angles for a family-oriented SUV. All-wheel-drive versions are available and include both hill descent control and an electronically lockable differential. The front seats are comfortable at the outset. But over long distances, their contours don't feel as supportive. A lack of seat-bottom adjustability may contribute here. The same can be said for the rear seats, though their reclining seatbacks help. The door armrests are ultra-plush. The suspension smooths out all the bumps and ruts in the road commendably well. Over larger dips, there is an ever-so-slight sensation of buoyancy that may affect third-row riders sensitive to motion sickness. But the same can be said for other SUVs in its class. Passengers are well-isolated from exterior noise. Road noise will creep in over certain surfaces in the form of a steady hum, but there are certainly competitors less successful than the Highlander with regard to noise control. This cabin is comfortably quiet. The automatic climate control functions use logical dials for temperature control and buttons for fan speed. Rear passengers control their own climate manually via a panel of buttons on the back of the center console. Heated and ventilated front seats work well, and ceiling-mounted vents for second and third rows help make everyone happy. The size of the dash and distance from the driver require a stretch for some controls. The simplicity of dials for frequently used functions such as climate, volume and media selection is welcome, though touch-sensitive buttons near the display screen lack tactile feedback and require too much of your attention to push. The wide doors open almost 90 degrees, making entry a breeze, but their size can be a drawback in tight spaces. Both the second-row captain's chair and bench seat options slide forward to allow easy third-row access. The levers to manipulate the seats are quite heavy to pull. Driver-seat adjustability is such that most will find an acceptable position. The steering wheel tilts and telescopes, and there is a broad range of fore-aft seat movement. This said, thigh support is lacking, and the seat bottom does not extend or tilt upward to help support longer legs. Headroom, legroom and elbow room are ample for first- and second-row occupants and even more prominent with the captain's chairs. The Highlander's tall, square interior shape adds to the spaciousness. Adults will not fit in the third row no matter how far forward the second-row seats are positioned. A large windshield and tall side windows provide excellent outward visibility. Huge second-row headrests obstruct the over-the-shoulder view somewhat, but blind spots are minimal otherwise. The standard rearview and optional surround-view cameras are excellent. Despite a somewhat aging interior design, the Highlander offers excellent fit and finish all around. The leather seating is of a high quality, and interior pieces are soft where they should be. You get the sense that Toyota built the Highlander to last. An innovative storage nook runs the length of the dash. Cupholders are abundant, and the door pockets are long and wide. A deep bin between the front seats fits it all. The optional captain's chair configuration has shallow trays between the seats. Overall, the Highlander has plenty of storage for small items. With all three rows of seats up, the Highlander's cargo space trails the pack. The load floor, with the third-row and second-row seats folded down, is nearly flat with a volume of 83.2 cubic feet. The cargo space is decently roomy, but rivals such as the Chevy Traverse are noticeably bigger in back. There is a lot of legroom for child seats in the second row, but it is tighter in the third. LATCH anchors and tethers are numerous and easily accessed. There is a conversation mirror for spying on your kids, as well as optional Driver Easy Speak feature, which uses speakers to amplify voices. Its 5,000-pound max tow rating (for SE and Limited trims) aligns with all the top players in this segment. A towing receiver hitch and wiring harness are available as an option. The nav system is logical to use and will get you where you need to be. Traffic info is not as accurate as what's provided by smartphone projection apps used by competitive vehicles. We like the simple layout of the radio dials and redundant controls located both on the touchscreen and steering wheel. Bluetooth phone connection and switching between paired phones are quick. Media integration options vary from aux jacks to USB (five total!) to a two-prong 12-volt outlet. The lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Audio hurts the Toyota since many of its peers offer this integration as standard. Many driver aids are standard, and most can be activated or deactivated at will. The adaptive cruise system is especially effective, but the lane departure system only works when lanes are marked clearly. Voice controls are basic (phone calls, navigation directions, radio tuning) and respond acceptably well once you've learned the correct prompt for each. Voice training is available to help effectiveness. The voice input volume is also adjustable, so the user does not have to shout to make commands. Priced  right in the middle of the Highlander lineup, the XLE is our pick. It  comes standard with the V6 engine and several desirable extras, including  blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems, leather upholstery,  heated front seats, and keyless entry and ignition.  Toyota Highlander LE The  base LE starts with a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine (185 horsepower, 184 pound-feet of torque), a six-speed  automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. The 3.5-liter V6 (295 hp, 263  lb-ft) that comes standard on all other trims is optional on the LE and pairs  with an eight-speed automatic. Optional all-wheel drive can be added to the V6. Standard  LE features include 18-inch alloy wheels, heated mirrors, a windshield wiper  de-icer, rear privacy glass, a rearview camera, rear air conditioning, a  height-adjustable driver's seat, a sliding and reclining 60/40-split second-row  seat, and a reclining 60/40-split third-row seat. You also get a 6.1-inch  touchscreen, five USB ports (three in the front and two in the rear),  Bluetooth, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player. Every  Highlander also comes with the Toyota Safety Sense bundle that includes  automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, and forward  collision warning with automatic emergency braking.  Toyota Highlander LE Plus The LE Plus adds the V6 engine, a  height-adjustable power liftgate, a flip-up rear window, foglights, tri-zone  automatic climate control, upgraded upholstery and trim, a power-adjustable  driver's seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert systems, a high-resolution 8-inch touchscreen, satellite  and HD radio, and a variety of smartphone-connection apps. Toyota Highlander XLE Building  on the LE Plus' equipment, the XLE adds  a sunroof, roof rails, keyless entry and ignition, an upgraded instrument  panel, leather upholstery (simulated leather for the third row), heated front  seats, a power-adjustable passenger seat, an auto-dimming rearview mirror,  second-row window sunshades, a 110-volt power outlet, a navigation system, and  Driver Easy Speak, which carries the driver's voice through the rear speakers  to distant passengers.  Toyota Highlander SE The SE is equipped similarly to the XLE  but with a sport theme that extends to larger 19-inch wheels, LED running  lights, and sportier suspension tuning and styling elements.  Toyota Highlander Limited The Limited adds LED running lights,  different 19-inch wheels, rear parking sensors, a rear cargo cover, heated and  ventilated front seats, driver-seat memory settings, second-row captain's  chairs, and a 12-speaker JBL audio system to the XLE trim's features.  Toyota Highlander Limited Platinum The Limited Platinum gains a panoramic  sunroof, automatic wipers, a surround-view parking camera system, front parking  sensors, Safety Connect emergency communications, a heated steering wheel, and  heated second-row seats.",

    "full_description": "After a complete redesign last year, the 2010 Toyota Corolla adds standard stability control but otherwise holds its ground. The 2010 Toyota Corolla compact sedan rides well and is fuel-efficient in base form, but is otherwise unremarkable. Brand loyalty will likely keep the buyers coming, but there are better choices in this segment. There's an obvious reason why the 2010 Toyota Corolla is bound to be one of the country's best-selling vehicles this year: Since its debut more than four decades ago, the Corolla has become synonymous with dependability. That alone, we suspect, is enough for many. But if these shoppers did venture over to their local Hyundai or Mazda or Honda dealers for some test-drives, they'd likely realize that the Corolla is far from the class leader it once was. It's not a bad car by any stretch of the imagination -- it's just that its rivals have gotten better, while Toyota has largely stood pat.On the bright side, the Corolla provides impressive fuel economy with the volume-selling base 1.8-liter engine, and its ride is more compliant than the typical compact sedan's. Its controls are also intuitive, though most cars these days can claim the same. In other respects, the Corolla ranks anywhere from \"unremarkable\" (acceleration, seat comfort) to \"below average\" (handling) to \"memorably poor\" (the vague and artificial-feeling steering). Even the interior materials aren't anything to write home about -- a departure from Corollas past.Like some other small sedans, the Corolla offers a more powerful optional engine -- a 2.4-liter four-cylinder borrowed from the Camry that generates 158 horsepower. It's available only in the sport-themed Corolla XRS, which boasts quicker steering, bigger wheels and a front strut tower brace for sharpened handling. Unfortunately, this model also fails to impress. Despite decent grunt from the larger engine, the XRS doesn't provide a particularly exciting driving experience, and its fuel economy is a significant downgrade.The 2010 Toyota Corolla generally gets the job done. But the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Mazda 3 are similarly priced compact sedans that do it better, and all have similar (or even better) modern reputations for reliability. We'd also give the Mitsubishi Lancer a look, and the Honda Fit is another intriguing alternative, combining superior cargo space with a smaller footprint. In all likelihood, the Corolla will maintain its status as the world's best-selling automotive nameplate -- but not because it's the world's best compact sedan. Other than the XRS, all 2010 Toyota Corollas are motivated by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 132 hp and 128 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed manual transmission driving the front wheels is standard, and a four-speed automatic is optional. The manual returns 26 mpg city/35 mpg highway and 30 mpg combined, according to the EPA, while the automatic squeezes out 27 mpg city. We recorded a 10.1-second 0-60-mph time for the 1.8-liter four-cylinder and automatic, which is about average for this class of engine.The XRS muscles up with a 2.4-liter engine good for 158 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque. A five-speed manual is standard and a five-speed automatic is optional. We recorded a 0-60 time of 9.1 seconds with this engine connected to the manual. Fuel economy drops significantly, with a 22/30/25 rating for both transmissions. The Corolla comes standard with antilock brakes, stability control, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and active front head restraints. Notably, only the XRS has four-wheel disc brakes; other Corollas have rear drums. In government crash testing, the Corolla earned four out of five stars for its protection of occupants in frontal collisions. Side impact testing resulted in a perfect five stars for front occupants and four stars for rear passengers. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Corolla scored a top rating of \"Good\" for its performance in frontal-offset and side impact collisions. The Corolla's base 1.8-liter engine should satisfy most shoppers in this segment, delivering sufficient acceleration and very good fuel economy. The four-speed automatic on non-XRS models works adequately well, but rivals are increasingly offering five-speed automatics, particularly on higher trim levels. In any trim, the 2010 Toyota Corolla's softly sprung ride is perfect for commuting, and wind and road noise are nicely quelled, even at highway speeds. Handling is on the soggy side, even in ostensibly sporty XRS trim, a natural consequence of the Corolla's compliant suspension tuning. The electric steering is so vague and numb that you may find yourself making repeated corrections simply to keep the car traveling in a straight line. The 2010 Toyota Corolla's cabin is pleasant enough, but it doesn't stand out in any particular way. Unlike previous Corollas, this one has a telescoping steering wheel, which helps longer-legged drivers find a comfortable position. In back, the Corolla offers plenty of space for children and just enough for adults. The control layout is intuitive, as you'd expect in a modern compact sedan. A double glovebox increases storage up front. Materials quality is adequate, but no better than the norm in this class. The trunk measures an average 12.3 cubic feet, but boasts a usefully wide opening. The Corolla XLE also gets the 16-inch wheels and an upgraded stereo while adding accoutrements like a sliding center armrest, wood-grain interior trim, electroluminescent gauges, keyless entry and variable intermittent wipers. The XRS forgoes some of the XLE's standard conveniences, but it boasts a larger engine, 17-inch alloy wheels, sport-tuned suspension and steering, a rear deck spoiler and chrome interior trim. Cruise control is also standard on the XRS; it's optional on other Corollas.Heated mirrors are optional across the Toyota Corolla line, while the S, XLE and XRS are eligible for a sunroof, an upgraded JBL sound system (with satellite radio and Bluetooth connectivity) and a navigation system with real-time traffic. Leather upholstery is available on the S and XRS only.",

    "full_description": "For 2013, the Toyota Sienna drops the four-cylinder engine and gains a few added standard features. Roomy, comfortable, well-built and offered in several different trim levels, the 2013 Toyota Sienna minivan is an excellent choice for larger families.Notably, we picked the 2013 Toyota Sienna as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars, Trucks and SUVs. When it comes to family haulers, nothing beats a minivan.  And when it comes to minivans, it's tough to beat the 2013 Toyota Sienna. As you'd  expect of any modern minivan, the Sienna offers a spacious interior and an  embarrassment of riches as far as available luxury and convenience features go.  But it's the Sienna's impressive combination of refinement, performance, fuel  efficiency and reliability that push it to the front of this segment.\nThis year sees the four-cylinder engine dropped from the  roster. Though we liked the way the Sienna drove with this lightweight engine,  we imagine the number of buyers who selected it has been fairly small, given  the fact that it got pretty much the same fuel mileage as the frugal but much  more powerful V6. There are also a few new standard features, as the LE picks  up triple-zone automatic climate control while the XLE and Limited gain a blind-spot  monitoring system.\nSpeaking of trim levels, the Sienna offers quite the  variety, including the SE with its sport-tuned suspension and aggressive  styling tweaks that do their best to make the minivan look cool. If a first-class  cabin is more to your liking, you'll be pleased to know that luxuries such as  recliner-style seating for the second row and a rear video entertainment system  sporting a large split-screen monitor are available.\nRegardless of which version you lean toward, the 2013 Toyota  Sienna has the basics nailed down, providing a smooth, quiet ride, spirited  acceleration and comfortable seating. It also can carry up to eight and offers available  all-wheel drive, the latter exclusive to the Sienna and a boon for those who  frequently slog through rain and snow.\nOf course, the minivan segment boasts some impressive  choices. Our other top choice is the talented 2013 Honda  Odyssey whose wide,  uniquely configurable second-row seat adds an extra measure of versatility. You  might also want to look at the 2013 Dodge Grand  Caravan or the 2013 Nissan Quest for their fold-flat second- and third-row seating arrangements. Still, the 2013 Toyota Sienna  is easy to recommend to savvy consumers thanks to its pleasing mix of features,  power and versatility. Every Toyota Sienna comes with a 3.5-liter V6 that delivers  266 horsepower and 245 pound-feet of torque and which drives the front wheels  through a six-speed automatic transmission. The  Sienna LE, XLE and Limited models can also be had with all-wheel drive.\nIn Edmunds testing, we timed a front-drive Sienna Limited  from zero to 60 mph in a swift 7.5 seconds. The EPA fuel economy estimates come  in at 18 mpg city/25 mpg highway and 21 mpg combined. Opting for all-wheel  drive drops those estimates to 16/23/19. Antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control,  front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, a driver-side knee  airbag and active front head restraints are standard on all 2013 Toyota Sienna  models. A package that includes active cruise control, a pre-collision warning  system and hill start assist is optional on the Limited. At our test track, a  Sienna Limited stopped from 60 mph in 127 feet -- about average for the minivan  segment.\nIn government crash testing, the  Sienna received an overall score of four stars out of five. It got three stars  for overall frontal crash protection and five stars for overall side crash  protection. In tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Sienna  earned a top score of \"Good\" for its performance in frontal-offset,  side-impact and roof-strength crash tests. We've long been impressed with the Sienna's V6, which has  the juice to deliver lively acceleration whether you're bopping around town  running errands or swiftly getting up to cruising speed on the freeway. The  smart six-speed automatic does a great job at\u00a0keeping the thrust on tap,  yet the combination still manages to provide respectable fuel mileage provided  one isn't too heavy on the throttle.\nThe 2013 Toyota Sienna's ride quality is plush, and handling  is competent in all versions. The SE's recalibrated suspension helps it provide  more agile handling with a somewhat firmer (though still comfortable) ride  quality. The steering is typical Toyota, meaning precise if somewhat numb,  though the SE offers a meatier feel to the steering action. Lower trim levels of the Sienna are attractively decked out  with high-quality fabric upholstery, while higher-end models get leather along  with faux-wood cabin accents. Some of the plastics feel a bit downmarket,  though, while others -- such as the intentionally rough-textured plastic on the  dash -- are just plain odd. Seating is plush, there's abundant space for  storage and the Sienna's controls are user-friendly.\nOn the electronics front, the Sienna's available navigation  system includes Entune, a suite of smartphone-connected services that includes  features like the Bing search engine, Pandora streaming radio, real-time  traffic, sports and stock information. The touchscreen interface is pretty easy  to use, but sometimes the virtual buttons' delayed response to touch inputs can  be frustrating. We do like the available rear-seat entertainment system, which  features a split-screen monitor that allows two different media (e.g., a movie  on one side and a video game on the other) to play simultaneously.\nWith a seven-passenger Sienna, you get second-row captain's  chairs that tip up to allow easier access to the third row; these chairs also  have a long-slide feature to maximize legroom for taller passengers. However,  the seats do require a fair amount of effort to slide, and removing them is a  job best left to two people, as they are rather heavy and awkward. The  eight-passenger version comes with a 40/20/40-split second-row bench whose  center section slides close to the front seats for easier access to the little  one seated there.\nIf you choose a model fitted with the lounge seats, the  second-row passengers get to recline in La-Z-Boy-style comfort, provided the  seats are slid back far enough (and the front seats are up far enough) to allow  the built-in footrests to come up all the way. With the second-row seats out and  the third row stowed, the Sienna provides a massive 150 cubic feet of maximum  cargo capacity. \nThe Sienna  L includes 17-inch alloy wheels, sliding rear doors with power-down windows,  triple-zone air-conditioning, full power accessories, a telescoping steering  wheel, cruise control and a four-speaker sound system with a CD player and an  auxiliary audio jack.\nThe LE  adds a roof rack, power-sliding side doors, power rear liftgate, privacy glass,  heated outside mirrors, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, floor- and  overhead-mounted control consoles, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, triple-zone  automatic climate control, an eight-way power driver seat, a four-way power  passenger seat, power driver lumbar support, second- and third-row sunshades, a  3.5-inch display (including a back-up monitor), Bluetooth (phone and streaming  audio) and a six-speaker sound system with satellite radio and an iPod/USB  interface.\nThe  sport-themed SE is equipped similarly to the LE but adds more aggressive  styling thanks to 19-inch alloy wheels, a unique front fascia (with foglights,  mesh inserts and a larger air intake), lower body skirting and tinted head- and  taillights. The SE also has firmer suspension tuning, revised power steering  and a power liftgate. Inside the SE are leatherette/cloth upholstery, unique  instruments and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\nThe Sienna XLE adds a number of  luxury features to the LE's list of amenities, including a unique metallic-gray  grille insert, automatic headlights, a sunroof, a tow prep package, an acoustic  windshield, a blind spot monitor, leather upholstery, wood-grain interior trim,  heated front seats and auto-up/down power windows. \nThe plush Limited features 18-inch  alloy wheels, a satin chrome grille, auto-dimming outside mirrors, dual  sunroofs, front and rear parking sensors, keyless ignition and entry, two-tone  leather seating, driver memory settings, a leather-and-wood steering wheel, an  upgraded 10-speaker JBL surround-sound audio system, second-row lounge seats  and a power split-folding third-row seat.\nOptions on the Toyota Sienna are  grouped into packages that vary based on trim level and buying region. Notable  highlights include xenon headlights, rain-sensing wipers, adaptive cruise  control, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system with a large screen that can be  split to display two different sources and a navigation system with Entune  smartphone app integration and a back-up camera.",

    "full_description": "The 2016 Toyota Tacoma has been completely redesigned. Looking for a midsize pickup that can do it all? You should definitely check out the 2016 Toyota Tacoma, a go-anywhere truck that combines an efficient V6 engine with a truck bed loaded with clever cargo-management features. We're especially partial to the TRD off-road version and its unrivaled off-highway capability. Let's see which one is right for you. For more than 20 years now, the Toyota  Tacoma has been a very popular alternative for shoppers who feel regular  full-size trucks are just too big or too expensive. It's no surprise, then,  that the redesigned 2016 Toyota Tacoma hasn't drifted far from the proven  formula. If you liked the long-running previous-generation Tacoma, you're going  to like this one, too. But Toyota has also made some notable improvements that  burnish the latest version's appeal.\n\nThe new 2016 Toyota Tacoma  bears a clear family resemblance to the larger Tundra, although its dimensions  are largely unchanged from the outgoing model.\nOne thing you won't find in the 2016  Tacoma lineup is the venerable handyman special, a.k.a. the regular-cab 4x2 stripper  with dinky steel wheels. Regular cabs were ousted last year, leaving only the extended  cab and crew cab body styles on the roster, and for 2016, all rear-drive  Tacomas share the raised suspension and ground clearance with their 4x4  brethren. Capable off-road performance is still part of the 4x4 Tacoma's  repertoire, though, as the TRD Off-Road model (with the automatic transmission)  inherits the Crawl Control system from the 4Runner and Land Cruiser. All  Tacomas even get an integrated GoPro mount so owners can record their  adventures (and misadventures). Other additions for 2016 include a revamped interior  design with Toyota's latest touchscreen interfaces, a standard lockable damped  tailgate and an available tri-fold hard tonneau cover.\nUnder the hood, the outgoing Tacoma's base  2.7 liter four-cylinder engine carries over unchanged, but the noisy and  somewhat coarse 4.0-liter V6 has been replaced by a smoother and more  fuel-efficient V6. Derived from the 3.5-liter V6 found in many Toyota products,  the Tacoma's version boasts 42 more horsepower than last year's V6. Both  engines are offered with a new six-speed automatic transmission, and 4x4s are available  with a manual gearbox as well. Tacoma 4x4s also get a redesigned transfer case  and a beefier rear axle.\nPut it all together and you're looking  at a pretty desirable choice for a midsize pickup. That said, you should still  take a look at the vastly improved General Motors twins, the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon. For  taller drivers, they're likely more comfortable to drive, and V6 performance is  stronger, though the Colorado and Canyon aren't as capable off-road as the  Tacoma. The General will also be adding a diesel option to both trucks for  2016, which should give them a huge advantage in fuel economy. There's also the Nissan Frontier to consider, but it's overdue for a redesign and brings up the rear in terms of  refinement. Overall, we'd say the redesigned 2016 Toyota Tacoma is  well-positioned to retain its throne. The 2016 Toyota Tacoma comes with either  a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine (SR and SR5 only) or a 3.5 liter V6. Both rear-wheel-drive  (4x2) and four-wheel-drive (4x4) configurations are available. All 4x2 Tacomas  get a six-speed automatic transmission, while 4x4s can be had with the  automatic or one of two manual transmissions (five speeds for the four-cylinder  engine, six speeds for the V6).\nTacoma 4x4s have low-range gearing.  Manual-transmission TRD Off-Road models also get a special mode that allows the  truck to be started in gear without depressing the clutch, thus eliminating  clutch slippage and rollback while stalled going uphill.\n\nAll 2016 Toyota Tacomas  offer 9.4 inches of ground clearance, even 4x2 models. The TRD Off-Road 4x4  seen here is a serious bushwhacking machine.\nThe 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine is  rated at 159 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque. EPA fuel economy ratings  are 21 mpg  combined (19 city/23 highway) for the 4x2 automatic, 20 mpg combined (19/21) for the 4x4 manual and 20 mpg combined (19/22) for the 4x4 automatic.\nThe V6's output jumps up to 278 hp and  265 lb-ft of torque. EPA estimates for a V6 4x2 Tacoma (automatic) are 21 mpg combined (19/24). A V6 4x4 Tacoma returns 19 mpg combined (17/21) with the manual (18 mpg Double  Cab) or 20  mpg combined (18/23) with the automatic.\nIn Edmunds performance testing of two TRD  Off-Road Double Cab V6 models with the automatic, we recorded an average acceleration  time to 60 mph of 8.3 seconds, which is slower than the four-wheel-drive  Colorado V6. A TRD Sport Double Cab V6 we tested hit 60 in a slightly better  8.2 seconds.\nFour-cylinder Tacomas can tow a maximum  of 3,500 pounds, while V6 models can handle between 6,400 and 6,800 pounds,  depending on driveline and cab configuration. All Tacomas come with active front  headrests, front-seat side airbags, driver and passenger knee airbags and  full-length side curtain airbags, as well as traction and stability control and  antilock brakes with brake assist. Unlike most pickup trucks, the Tacoma still  uses drum brakes at the rear. A blind-spot warning system with rear cross-traffic  alert is optional on TRD models and standard on the Tacoma Limited.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, a TRD Off-Road  Double Cab V6 needed 135 feet to stop from 60 mph, a disappointing early result  that's partly due to this trim level's trail-busting tire specification. A  subsequent testing of a different TRD Off-Road Double Cab V6 resulted in a much  better 124 feet. A TRD Sport Double Cab V6 with less extreme tires stopped in  130 feet. For reference, our best-braking Colorado needed just 123 feet. The Tacoma's 3.5-liter V6 engine is noticeably  smoother and quieter than its 4.0-liter predecessor, and it feels sprightly enough  in real-world driving, especially at higher rpm. In our acceleration tests,  though, it trails the old V6 to 60 mph despite its extra 42 horses. We expect  that testing the manual-transmission version will yield further insight, but  for now, the numbers don't lie -- the V6-powered GM twins are significantly  quicker from zero to 60. Also, the automatic transmission tends to hunt between  gears on freeway inclines, making it more of a chore than expected to keep up  with traffic.\nThe 2016 Tacoma's cab is better insulated  than ever before, giving the truck a more serene ride on a variety of surfaces.  While the TRD Off-Road's suspension and 16-inch tires are optimized for rough  terrain, we like the way it soaks up the bumps on pavement, too. On a brief drive,  a Limited model felt noticeably firmer with its 18-inch tires and road-tuned  suspension setup, though certainly not uncomfortable. Either way, we applaud the  Tacoma's steering, which offers a pleasant build-up of effort and good  centering. Off-road, the Tacoma is ready for just about anything with its 9.4  inches of ground clearance and 29- or 32-degree approach angle, far surpassing  the GM twins' 8.4 inches and 18 degrees, respectively. After a remarkable 11 years on the  market, the old Tacoma was certainly showing its age from behind the wheel, so  we're pleased to see some contemporary design flair in the new truck's dashboard.  As expected, most of the materials seem to have been selected with durability  in mind, not luxury, but there are some inspired choices here and there,  including trim-specific dash inserts ranging from rubber (TRD trims) to  simulated leather (Limited). We're also happy that the user-friendly nature of  the control layout hasn't changed. The very responsive touchscreen interface  (measuring either 6.1 or 7.0 inches) sits front and center, with glove-friendly  climate control knobs and secondary switches beneath.\n\nThe 2016 Toyota Tacoma's  interior has been modernized and stylized, but the control layout remains  straightforward and easy to master.\nThe Tacoma's front seats are  distinguished by their low mounting position and lack of height adjustability.  Even if there were such adjustability, it wouldn't be very useful, as there's  already limited headroom for taller occupants. Another unfortunate Tacoma trait  is the comically short range of its telescoping steering wheel -- it seems to  come out about an inch, which is a couple inches short of satisfactory for  long-legged drivers.\nThe Tacoma Access Cab's scant backseat  space is best for children, but the Double Cab's rear quarters are adult-friendly,  featuring adequate legroom and an agreeably angled seatback. Both cabs feature  a folding rear seat, and the entry-level SR Access Cab can be ordered with a  Utility package that deletes the backseat entirely. Out back, the Tacoma comes  standard with a plastic-lined bed as well as four adjustable and four fixed  tie-down cleats, with a handy bed-mounted power outlet available on some models.  The tailgate is both removable and lockable, and if you open it and let go, it  won't slam down; damped hinges lower it gently to bumper level. \nThe Tacoma is offered in five trim  levels: SR, SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road and Limited.\nThe SR model comes standard with 16-inch  steel wheels, a cargo bed rail system with fixed and adjustable tie-downs, a  bedliner, a sliding rear window, full power accessories (windows, locks and  mirrors), air-conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with audio  controls, a GoPro windshield mount, a rearview camera, Bluetooth phone and  audio connectivity, voice controls, Siri Eyes Free (for Apple phones), a  6.1-inch touchscreen interface and a six-speaker audio system with a CD player,  a USB port and an auxiliary audio jack.\nOptions specific to the SR include the  SR Convenience package, which includes cruise control and remote keyless entry.  If you spring for that package, 16-inch black alloy wheels can be added as  well. Four-cylinder Access Cab models offer a Utility package, which deletes  the rear seat and sliding rear window, removes the two rear speakers (reducing  the total to four) and replaces the standard body-color door handles, bumpers  and mirror caps with black plastic pieces.\nThe SR5 model adds the SR Convenience package's  items plus foglights, chrome exterior accents, variable intermittent wipers,  rear privacy glass, a color trip computer, a leather-wrapped steering wheel  with phone and audio controls, satellite radio and the Scout GPS  Link navigation app (requires a compatible smartphone).\nSR5 options include the SR5 Appearance package,  which bundles 16-inch silver alloy wheels, body-color over-fenders and an  auto-dimming rearview mirror (V6 models only). An expanded version of the  Appearance package adds rear parking sensors and an upgraded infotainment  bundle with a 7-inch touchscreen, the Entune App Suite,  HD radio and an integrated navigation system.\nThe TRD Sport model adds LED daytime  running lights, unique exterior trim (including a hood scoop), 17-inch alloy  wheels, sport-tuned shock absorbers, a bed-mounted 120-volt power outlet, keyless  entry and ignition (automatic transmission only), a wireless phone charger, a  leather-trimmed shift lever, special upholstery (shared with the TRD Off-Road),  the auto-dimming rearview mirror and the SR5's optional upgraded infotainment bundle.\nTRD Sport options include a Premium and  Technology package that adds automatic headlights, a sunroof (Double Cab only),  dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, rear parking sensors and a blind-spot  monitor with rear cross-traffic alert. On Double Cab models with the automatic  transmission, this package can be ordered in conjunction with an upgraded JBL  stereo with a subwoofer.\nNext up is the TRD Off-Road model, which  adds its own rugged body trim (without the TRD Sport's hood scoop), special 16-inch  alloy wheels, Bilstein shock absorbers and chin-spoiler delete (to improve the  truck's off-road ability). All TRD Off-Road Tacomas share an electronic locking  rear differential, and the Crawl Control system (essentially cruise control for  off-road maneuvers between 1 and 5 mph) is further added if you select the  automatic transmission. Options mirror those of the TRD Sport.\nAt the top of the line is the Limited  model, which comes exclusively as a Double Cab.

    "full_description": "For 2010, the Toyota Sequoia receives a more powerful base V8 as well as front-seat knee airbags and an upgraded standard stereo with Bluetooth and iPod integration. Also, many Sequoia options and packages have either been simplified or eliminated altogether. Note that Toyota did not officially release a 2009 model. With class-leading refinement, versatility and user-friendly features, the 2010 Toyota Sequoia is our top pick among full-size SUVs. With the push for environmentally friendly cars and the memory of skyrocketing gas prices in 2008 still fresh in many people's minds, some buyers have had misgivings about purchasing a large SUV. Sales in general for this segment have been dismal recently, and even Toyota hasn't been immune. However, it seems there will always be customers with a genuine need for maximal passenger-carrying and towing capabilities. For those buyers, a long look at the 2010 Toyota Sequoia is in order.Coming off an upsizing redesign in 2008 that provided more room, stronger performance, more composed road manners and greater seating flexibility, the 2010 Sequoia (there was no 2009 model) receives a few tweaks to enhance its appeal. The most prominent change is the new base 4.6-liter V8 engine, which provides more power and slightly better fuel economy than the 4.7-liter V8 it replaces. Returning is the optional 381-horsepower 5.7-liter V8 that makes the Sequoia one of the quickest full-size SUVs out there. With this engine, a properly equipped Sequoia can tow up to 9,100 pounds.The Sequoia's well-tuned chassis provides a comfortable highway ride along with adequate back-road agility, while a relatively tight 39-foot turning circle makes the big truck easy to maneuver in parking lots. Growing families will also appreciate the Sequoia's versatile second-row seats, available as either a 40/20/40-split bench or captain's chairs. These seats feature plenty of fore-aft adjustment, allowing them to be positioned to optimize legroom or cargo room as needs dictate. Unlike the Tundra (and GM's full-size SUVs), the Sequoia has an independent rear suspension, which allows the roomy 60/40-split third-row seat to fold flat. Stowing the second- and third-row seats opens up a cavernous 121 cubic feet of cargo space for more serious hauling.As versatile and capable as the 2010 Toyota Sequoia is, buyers who don't require its massive towing capacity would do well to consider a large crossover like the GMC Acadia (or its Buick Enclave/Chevy Traverse relatives), Ford Flex or Mazda CX-9. These crossovers offer competitive passenger and cargo space with lower price tags, and they handle better and get superior fuel economy to boot. Still, for those who need a heavy-duty, full-size SUV, the 2010 Toyota Sequoia reigns supreme. Even when pitted against the competition that includes the Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon twins, the Ford Expedition and the Nissan Armada, the Sequoia prevails thanks to its versatility, strong performance and well-balanced road manners. The standard engine for the 2010 Sequoia SR5 is Toyota's new 4.6-liter V8, which produces 310 hp and 327 pound-feet of torque and comes paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Compared to last year's 4.7-liter engine, the new mill churns out an additional 34 hp while slightly improving fuel economy. The EPA estimates 14 mpg in the city, 19 mpg on the highway and 16 mpg in combined driving for rear-wheel-drive models. 4WD models attain 1 less mpg across the board.Optional on the Sequoia SR5 and standard on everything else is a muscular 5.7-liter V8 that produces 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed automatic is standard here as well. Thanks in part to its dual variable valve timing, the larger V8 achieves nearly the same fuel economy as the 4.6-liter engine, at 14/19/15 mpg. Properly equipped, a 5.7-liter Sequoia can tow up to 9,100 pounds.The Sequoia is available in either two-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive versions. Four-wheel-drive models feature low-range gearing. In our testing, a 4WD Sequoia with the 5.7-liter V8 hit 60 mph in an impressive 6.7 seconds. Standard safety equipment for all 2010 Toyota Sequoias includes antilock disc brakes, stability control, front-seat side airbags, front knee airbags and three-row side curtain airbags. Front and rear parking sensors are standard on the Sequoia Platinum and Limited, as is a back-up camera, but these are unavailable on the SR5. As of this writing, government crash tests have not yet been published for the 2010 model with the new knee airbags, but last year's Sequoia earned five stars (out of five) for the driver and four for the passenger for head-on collision protection. Even if you don't ordinarily like large SUVs, the 2010 Toyota Sequoia's pleasant driving experience might win you over. The 5.7-liter V8's abundance of low-end torque makes passing maneuvers effortless, and the six-speed automatic is always on point with gear selection, even when towing. Even the 4.6-liter V8 is no slouch, particularly if you won't be maxing out your SUV's payload and towing capacities on a regular basis.Ride comfort ranges from smooth and composed in an SR5 to downright plush in a Sequoia Platinum with the adaptive dampers. Around corners, the suspension does a fine job of managing 3 tons' worth of SUV, though the numb steering adds to the overall sense of heft. Aside from audio and navigation controls that are hard to reach, the Sequoia's interior is a triumph of ergonomics, storage bins and family-friendly conveniences. The second-row seats adjust fore and aft regardless of whether the 40/20/40-split bench or the captain's chairs are specified. In addition, the bench seat's center \"20\" section slides farther forward, which can be useful if a child safety seat is installed. There's also a conversation mirror so you can quell potential uprisings in the rear quarters. The 60/40 third-row seat in Limited and Platinum models has both a power-recline and a power-fold feature. With both sets of rear seats folded down, the Sequoia's cargo space tops out at 121 cubic feet. The top-of-the-line Sequoia Platinum adds load-leveling rear air springs, adaptive shock absorbers, a power liftgate, a sunroof, heated and cooled front seats, heated second-row captain's chairs (dropping capacity to seven), power-folding and -reclining rear seats, a navigation system, a back-up camera and a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel.For 2010, Toyota has simplified Sequoia ordering by eliminating most of the confusing options and packages from previous years. Now, the only available options apply to Limited models, which are eligible for the second-row captain's chairs, navigation system and rear-seat entertainment system from the Platinum edition.",

    "full_description": "For 2010, the Toyota Venza receives some technology upgrades in the form of a newly standard USB port, iPod connectivity and Bluetooth. The 2010 Toyota Venza blends the attributes of a crossover SUV with those of a wagon, resulting in a pleasantly useful form of family transportation. Like the platypus, the 2010 Toyota Venza is a bit hard to categorize among its peers. Not quite a wagon yet not quite a crossover SUV, the Venza puts a new twist on the family car. Yet this crossbreed shouldn't come as a surprise, as Toyota has a knack for creating all-new segments or modifying existing ones for more widespread appeal. Before nearly every manufacturer had a compact crossover SUV, there was the RAV4. And Toyota's upscale Lexus division broke similar ground for the midsize luxury crossover segment with the RX 300.Using components from the Camry and the Highlander, the Venza falls between the two in terms of size. Its wheelbase is the same as the Camry's, while its width and ride height are similar to the Highlander's. The engine choices are the same as the Highlander's, too (a 2.7-liter inline-4 or a 3.5-liter V6), yet the Venza is more maneuverable, with surprisingly decent handling and a comfortable ride quality to boot.Thanks to its wider-than-a-Camry body, the Venza provides plenty of space for passengers to spread out. Larger families will lament the unavailability of a third-row seat (you'll need a RAV4 or a Highlander for that), but the Venza's wagonlike body provides a respectable maximum cargo capacity of 70 cubic feet. Another bonus is interior quality; some current Toyota models (e.g., Camry and Corolla) have gone downhill in this regard, but the Venza's cabin could almost be mistaken for that of a Lexus, as quality materials and tight fit and finish are evident throughout.Indeed, were it not for its price premium, we'd take a Venza over a Camry in a heartbeat. The Venza also makes a strong showing against similarly sized crossover SUVs like the Ford Edge and Nissan Murano, and it's certainly less aesthetically challenged than the new Honda Accord Crosstour and Subaru Outback. Though it may be hard to define, the 2010 Toyota Venza hits an appealing sweet spot between midsize family sedan and crossover SUV. The 2010 Toyota Venza is available with a four- or six-cylinder engine and can be had in either front- or all-wheel drive. All versions feature a six-speed automatic transmission. The 2.7-liter four-cylinder produces 182 horsepower and 182 pound-feet of torque. Estimated fuel economy with this engine and front-wheel drive is 21 mpg city/29 mpg highway and 24 mpg combined. All-wheel drive drops those numbers by 1 mpg.The 3.5-liter V6 makes 268 hp and 246 lb-ft of torque. Its fuel economy with front-wheel drive is an EPA estimated 19 city/26 highway and 22 combined. Once again, all-wheel drive produces a 1-mpg loss in all categories. In Edmunds testing, a front-drive Venza V6 went from zero to 60 mph in a quick 7.1 seconds. Every 2010 Venza comes standard with four-wheel antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag and front-seat active head restraints.In government crash testing, the 2010 Toyota Venza earned perfect five-star scores in all frontal- and side-impact tests. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety likewise gave the Venza its highest rating (\"Good\") in frontal-offset and side-impact tests. Our brake testing resulted in a short 60-0-mph stopping distance of 122 feet. Like the Camry on which it is based, the 2010 Toyota Venza is designed for comfort and ease of driving. Unlike the Camry, however, this crossover wagon has a hefty, robust feeling over bumps. Toyota's typical smooth ride quality has been retained, though, and road noise remains low at highway speeds. While both engines provide ample power, the spirited V6 -- one of the best available -- is obviously the way to go if passing power takes precedence over fuel economy. The electric power steering is surprisingly responsive for this class, as is the handling, but there's not much for driving enthusiasts to get excited about beyond that excellent six-cylinder. While other recent Toyota products have disappointed us in their build and materials quality, this is not the case with the Venza. The sleek center console is important to note, as its high-mounted shifter frees up space between the seats for a large bin, ample cupholders and a smaller bin designed for iPods and other small devices. There's another compartment designed specifically to hold cell phones. The audio and climate controls are a new design for Toyota, but they remain user-friendly. A high-mounted LCD screen shows trip computer and climate control information along with the optional back-up camera display.Although it lacks a third-row seat, the Venza provides loads of passenger space -- particularly in the rear, which features reclining seatbacks. A bit more driver-seat adjustment would be nice, though. The cargo area can swallow 70 cubic feet of stuff with the rear seat folded and a healthy 34.4 cubes with the seats up. These numbers put the Venza a smidgen ahead of the Ford Edge and just a bit behind the RAV4. The availability of Toyota options and packages often depends on region, so check with your local dealer to determine what is offered in your area. Mostly grouped into packages, these options include a power tailgate, a rearview camera, a sunroof, keyless ignition and entry, xenon headlamps, a power passenger seat, leather upholstery, wood trim, heated front seats, heated mirrors and a windshield-wiper de-icer. A 13-speaker surround-sound audio system is also available. It can be ordered separately or bundled with the optional voice-activated touchscreen navigation system or the rear-seat entertainment system.",

    "full_description": "A Sport trim level debuts and revised SAE testing procedures have resulted in reductions in the stated horsepower and torque ratings, though actual output is unchanged. With its fuel-efficient engine lineup, full complement of safety features and easygoing demeanor, the 2006 Toyota Highlander is one of our top recommendations to those who need SUV utility but don't want any unnecessary bulk or fuel bills. The Toyota Highlander SUV debuted in 2001. It was one of the first midsize \"crossover\" SUVs to appear, and Toyota designed it to complement the more rugged and trucklike 4Runner. The Highlander has a carlike unibody design which leads to better handling, less cabin noise, improved crashworthiness and easier entry and exit for passengers.The Toyota Highlander is meant for people who like the image and versatility of an SUV but prioritize the ride, handling and comfort of a sedan. Think of the Highlander as an oversize Camry wagon that went clothes shopping at REI, and you've got the general idea. Even in its sixth year on the market, the Highlander remains one of the better values for families who need a comfortable, easy-to-drive vehicle that can carry a fair amount of cargo, handle occasional snow and ice during the winter months and still turn in respectable fuel economy. Although you should definitely explore all your options in this segment, the 2006 Toyota Highlander offers a well-rounded package for the average crossover SUV buyer. There are two engine choices for this Toyota SUV: a 2.4-liter four-cylinder (that comes with the base Highlander) or a 3.3-liter V6 (optional on the base model and standard on the Sport and Limited trims). The four-cylinder makes 155 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque, while the smooth V6 puts out 215 ponies and 222 lb-ft of torque. A four-speed automatic transmission is standard on four-cylinder models, while V6 Highlanders upgrade to a five-speed unit. Tow ratings are on the light side, the maximum being 3,500 pounds on a properly equipped V6 model. The Highlander comes in both front-wheel-drive (2WD) and all-wheel-drive configurations. All Highlanders come with four-wheel antilock disc brakes equipped with electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) and BrakeAssist, a stability control system, a tire-pressure warning system and whiplash-reducing front seats. Optional on all models are seat-mounted side airbags for front occupants and side curtain airbags for the first and second rows. In government crash testing, the 2006 Toyota Highlander scored five stars (out of a possible five) for frontal-impact protection. In side-impact tests, it again received five stars for both front and rear passengers. In frontal offset crash testing administered by the IIHS, the Toyota earned a \"Good\" rating (the best possible). A fully independent suspension delivers an excellent combination of comfort and control, although, like the Camry, most Highlanders favor ride quality over handling. Drivers looking for a flatter cornering attitude will want to consider the Sport version with its firmer suspension tuning. Regardless of trim level, the Highlander weighs less than many other crossover SUVs, giving a more nimble feel. The base four-cylinder engine provides adequate power for those who travel light, but most buyers will prefer the V6, which provides smooth, strong acceleration in all situations. The Highlander's passenger accommodations are reasonably spacious, but newer competitors offer more room in the second row. Ordering the third-row bench allows the Toyota SUV to seat two additional passengers, preferably small ones, for a total capacity of seven. Unfortunately, the second-row seat's lack of a flip-and-fold mechanism makes the third row tougher to access than most. When it's time to haul groceries, the third-row seat folds flat into the floor (without requiring removal of the headrests), opening up 38.5 cubic feet of cargo space. Drop the 60/40-split second-row seats and there are 81.4 cubes to go around. The four-door Toyota Highlander SUV comes in three trims: base, Sport and Limited. The base models are decently equipped with items like 16-inch wheels; power windows, locks and mirrors; cruise control; air conditioning; keyless entry; and a CD player. The Sport spices things up with 17-inch polished alloys, sport suspension, foglights, color-keyed grille, chrome exterior trim, power driver seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel and gearshift and a CD player. The Limited features automatic headlights, 17-inch non-polished alloy wheels, heated outside mirrors, a windshield wiper de-icer, power-adjustable front seats, a fold-flat third-row seat, an upgraded JBL sound system and HomeLink. Popular options for the Highlander include a rear-seat DVD-based entertainment system, an in-dash CD changer, a tow package and, on the Limited trim, leather seating and a navigation system.",

    "full_description": "For 2016 the Toyota Prius has been fully redesigned.  Look no further than the 2016 Toyota Prius if fuel economy is what you're after. But you'll also enjoy more sophisticated ride and handling qualities and a quieter powertrain. Going green with a Prius has never been better.Notably, we picked the 2016 Toyota Prius as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars. The  fully redesigned 2016 Toyota Prius further cements the model's reputation as  the most fuel-efficient hybrid car you can buy. But the company that dominates  the hybrid sales market is not coasting on its success. Toyota turned its attention to refining the  rest of the car, with impressive results. At the same time, Toyota produced a  radically different exterior design that many of us find challenging to like, though  whether Prius fans will love it or hate it remains to be seen.\n\nThe redesigned 2016 Prius has styling unlike anything  else, unless you count the hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai, which seems to have  been the inspiration.\nThe  essential appeal of the Prius, of course, lies in its fuel economy, and for  2016 the numbers are indeed impressive, with an EPA combined rating of 52 mpg  for the standard car. But there is one hybrid that can beat it, and that  machine is the new Prius Eco, a fuel-economy-oriented variant (as if the Prius  needed one) that is rated at a whopping 56 mpg combined. As an added bonus, the  gas engine is now noticeably quieter when it comes to life, and it sounds less  strained during hard acceleration.\nBut  there's plenty more to recommend the new Prius than just the powertrain. The previous  Prius' odd upright driving position is no more, replaced by a lower, more  natural orientation that makes the car feel less like a science experiment. There's  more front leg- and headroom, too, although a couple inches of rear legroom have  been lost. The payoff is found in the cargo bay, which grows by 14 percent. Hybrid  credentials aside, the Prius has long been a smart pick due to its hatchback practicality,  and for 2016 it's even more practical than before.\nAs  for the car's underlying architecture, a lower and wider stance combines with  the new double-wishbone rear suspension to improve the car's ride and handling.  Bumps are now more readily absorbed, and the steering's added heft is  reassuring. This new Prius is still not speedy or all that exciting to drive,  but there are far fewer failings to overlook. It's a pleasant car to drive in  its own right.\nWith  these refinements, the Prius also has fewer peers than ever before. Honda has  shelved its slow-selling Insight, and no other automaker is attempting a Prius  rival. At this point it's a matter of size, mpg, configuration and, yes,  styling. Is the 2016 Prius hatchback big enough, or do you want the extra passenger  space of a midsize sedan that has a trunk? If so, the 2016 Ford Fusion Hybrid or the 2016 Toyota  Camry Hybrid might be worth a look. If a plug-in hybrid is more to your  liking, the redesigned Chevrolet  Volt is pretty impressive. But for a regular hybrid, we highly recommend the  2016 Toyota Prius. As before, the  new 2016 Toyota Prius is powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine and a pair  of electric motor/generators. Their outputs are blended in a unique  electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (CVT) that feeds  as much as 121 horsepower to the front wheels. Light to moderate braking transforms  one of the electric motors into a generator to keep the hybrid battery topped  up.\nIn Edmunds track  testing, a 2016 Prius Three accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 9.8 seconds, a  few tenths quicker than the outgoing model but 2.1 seconds slower than the last  Camry Hybrid sedan we tested. The upside is an EPA fuel economy rating  of 52 mpg combined (54 city/50 highway). Our  on-road testing of a Prius Three proved that this rating can be readily matched  or beaten. Those looking for ultimate frugality can turn to the new Prius Two Eco,  which earns an astonishing rating of 56 mpg combined (58 city/53 highway). Every  2016 Toyota Prius comes standard with antilock disc brakes, stability and  traction control, front side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, a  driver knee airbag and a passenger seat cushion airbag. A rearview camera also  comes standard.\nBlind  spot monitoring with cross-traffic alert comes standard on the Prius Four and  Four Touring. The Toyota Safety Sense package includes full-speed adaptive  cruise control, forward collision warning and lane departure warning and  intervention. It's standard on the Prius Three Touring and Four Touring and optional  on the Three and Four. \nThe  Safety Connect system that can be added to the Prius Four and Four Touring is  subscription-based (with a one-year free trial) and includes automatic  collision notification, stolen vehicle locator and one-touch access to roadside  and emergency assistance.\nIn  Edmunds brake testing, a Prius Three came to a halt from 60 mph in 120 feet,  which is solidly average. The  2016 Prius is just slightly quicker than before, so it's not going to win any  speed contests. That's perfectly acceptable in light of its maximum-mpg mission.  The new Prius powertrain is more evocative of a full-on electric vehicle than  ever. Part of this is due to improved noise suppression: You don't hear the  engine as much when it is running. But the system also stays in EV propulsion  mode more of the time, provided you're not a leadfoot.\n\nThe all-new Prius drives better than the nameplate's  reputation might lead you to believe.\nOn  diverse real-world roads, the Prius is even easier to drive than before, with  smoother-acting brakes and a bit more reassuring heft to the steering. The new  double-wishbone suspension is far more adept at soaking up road imperfections  and quelling body motions than before, and it's also an effective road noise  filter.  The  2016 Prius has a more conventionally laid out interior than its predecessor. A  traditional center console between the seats contains cupholders, a shallow  storage bin (home of the wireless phone-charging pad) and an armrest. The  stubby shifter with its separate Park button remains, and the speedometer and gauge  array still sit high in the center of the dash. A new head-up display option  can present the most crucial information directly in front of the driver.\n\nThe 2016 Toyota Prius trades the last generation's  sporty wraparound cockpit for a cabin with a more spacious feel.\nMaterials  quality feels appropriate, with interesting seat fabrics and leatherette  materials showing up on lower trim levels. But the choice of pearl white as a  prominent center console accent color is sure to be polarizing. And though some  legacy Prius design quirks remain (as well as one or two new ones), the layout  and control placement are generally easy to understand and use.\nThe  intuitive 7-inch touchscreen upgrade responds quickly to commands. A clumsy  Entune app is necessary for high-level smartphone integration, but you can do  without and still have a satisfying experience via the USB or Bluetooth audio  connections. Bluetooth pairing, incidentally, has been greatly simplified.\nPerhaps  the biggest change involves the driving position, which features a lower seat  with a less upright posture and more maximum head- and legroom despite a roof line  that's almost an inch lower. The view out is still clear thanks to a lower cowl  and side glass. And the telescoping steering wheel now has ample range of  adjustment, with simplified control buttons that have a more positive feel.\nBut  more than 2 inches of rear legroom has been lost. The remaining space is still  enough for most families, but the Prius may not be the choice it once was among  taxi drivers. The payoff is increased luggage capacity, which stands at 24.6  cubic feet, a full 3 cubic feet more than the last model. The Prius Two Eco and  Prius Four twins lack a spare tire, which lowers the floor and raises their  luggage capacity to a cavernous 27.3 cubic feet. \nStandard  features found on the Prius Two include 15-inch alloy wheels, automatic LED  headlights, LED running lights and taillights, heated mirrors, keyless entry  (driver door only) and ignition, automatic climate control, dual 4.2-inch driver  information screens, cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, cloth  upholstery, a height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, a  6.1-inch touchscreen display, a rearview camera, Bluetooth phone and audio  connectivity, voice recognition with Siri Eyes Free and a six-speaker audio system with a USB port, an auxiliary audio jack and a CD  player.\nThe  more efficient Prius Two Eco is fitted with ultralow-rolling-resistance tires,  two-tone wheel covers, a lighter lithium-ion hybrid battery, a lightweight  inflation kit instead of a spare tire and illuminated keyless entry on three  doors. The rear wiper that comes standard on the other trims is deleted here.\nInside  the Prius Three you'll find leatherette steering wheel and armrest trim, white  interior accents, a wireless phone charging pad (compatible phone case not  included) and the Toyota Entune premium infotainment system with a 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, satellite  radio, HD radio, real-time data (traffic, weather, fuel prices, sports, stocks)  and access to apps like Pandora, iHeartRadio, OpenTable and Yelp via a paired  smartphone running the Entune app.\n\nSleek automatic climate controls share space with  Toyota's familiar touchscreen infotainment system in the 2016 Prius.\nThe  Prius Four comes with a blind spot monitor, rear cross-traffic alert, automatic  wipers, leatherette upholstery with contrasting white stitching, heated front  seats, a power driver seat with adjustable lumbar, seatback storage pockets and  a rear cargo cover.\nStandard  equipment on the Three Touring or Four Touring includes everything on the corresponding  Three or Four plus 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, LED clearance lights,  unique rear bumper styling and leatherette upholstery with contrasting blue  seat stitching. Both also come standard with the Toyota Safety Sense package, which  includes full-speed adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and  intervention, a pre-collision warning system and automatic high beams.\nThe  Prius Three and Four can be upgraded with the Advanced Technology package, which  consists of a sunroof, a head-up display and the Toyota Safety Sense equipment  found on Touring models.\nFinally,  the Prius Four and Prius Four Touring can be equipped with the Premium  Convenience package, which includes JBL 10-speaker premium audio, a  self-parking system and Safety  Connect emergency services.",

    "full_description": "Rarely does a car get more popular with  age, but that's exactly what's happening with the Toyota 4Runner. Despite  entering its 10th year since it was completely redesigned \u2014 an  eternity in car terms \u2014 the 4Runner sells exponentially better today  than it did when minty fresh.  Perhaps that has to do with today's  SUV-hungry buyers, but the 2019 4Runner is also a distinctive model. It is  rugged and off-road capable, yet it's spacious and family-friendly. Sure, it's  a bit rough around the edges and lacks many of the technology features you'll  find in other SUVs, but there's an honesty to the 4Runner and a just-right  goodness that keeps it relevant. It won't be for everyone, but it'll be exactly  what a great many want. So, if you think you might be in that  \"great many,\" here are the 4Runner's good bits. Its rugged trucklike  construction, abundant ground clearance and legitimate off-road hardware give  it go-anywhere credentials few SUVs (and especially crossovers) can match or  surpass. At the same time, it has a large cabin with a big, boxy cargo area  that'll make packing for a go-anywhere adventure (or just a trip to Grandma's  for the holidays) that much easier. You also get a reputation for near  bulletproof reliability and a driving experience that's not as cumbersome or  trucklike as you'd expect for an off-road-oriented SUV.However, there are significant drawbacks  to consider. The 4Runner's advanced age means it lacks the accident-avoidance  tech found on other Toyota vehicles. Its cabin design and materials are more  utilitarian than those of similarly priced rivals, and infotainment features  route through a tiny 6.1-inch touchscreen. Also, the 4Runner can't match the  on-road refinement and fuel economy of more modern crossover SUVs.These distinct highs and lows are part of  that honesty we were talking about, though. The 4Runner is what it is. If you  can live with the lows, or weigh them favorably against its distinct highs, the  4Runner should prove its popularity is no fad.Notably, we picked the 2019 4Runner as one of Edmunds' Best Midsize SUVs for 2018. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the Toyota 4Runner Limited (4.0L V6 |  5-speed automatic | 4WD). The 4Runner exhibits surprisingly smooth, linear and powerful acceleration. Tall gearing and five speeds keep it in the powerband longer, unlike many of today's crossovers that shift to highest gears as quickly as possible. There's no insufferable lag, just ample thrust. It's not fast, but the V6 is surprisingly strong. The brake pedal has a nebulous feel through two-thirds of the pedal travel, so drivers might need some time to achieve consistently smooth stops. Plenty of stopping power remains in the last third of the pedal travel. There's an abundance of nosedive in emergency stops. Similar to the brakes, not a lot of real feel comes through the wheel, but the truck responds quickly and accurately. Steering effort is a bit heavy at higher speeds, but it's not fatiguing. At low speeds, it offers an appropriate amount of assist. The 4Runner is surprisingly stable, even in tight, short turns. Body roll isn't excessive. Controlling it requires deliberate easing off of the throttle, braking, settling, then stabbing the throttle midcorner. The Limited-specific suspension system is at work here, trying its best to make the 4Runner feel somewhat luxurious. Smooth throttle delivery and seamless shifting make the 4Runner feel less like a truck and more like a crossover, but it's not quite either. The transmission's five available gears enable the driver to wring maximum thrust from the V6, but additional gears would improve fuel economy. The 4Runner excels off-road, but the Limited model is the least capable due to its 20-inch wheels and low-hanging front fascia. SR5 and TRD models have superior chin clearance and better-suited wheels and tires. The TRD Off-Road trim has a lockable rear differential, and it's the only one with available disconnecting stabilizer bars. The broad cushions and seatbacks offer a wide surface area for long-distance comfort, although lumbar support feels overly firm. With the optional third-row seating package, the second-row seats can slide and recline, but the third row is for kids only or short trips with average-size adults. The ride is not quite crossover-smooth, but it's not truck-brutish either. It bounces around on crummy pavement. But if you've driven trucks and can tolerate the kind of vibrations and jostling that can creep into a truck's ride, you'll find the 4Runner more than acceptable because it rides better than a pickup. The isolation of road noise is good most of the time, but the squarish shape isn't particularly adept at quelling wind noise. It's not unreasonable or out of place in this type of vehicle, though. If you can get past controls that look as if they're from a Tonka set, they're large and easy to use. The climate system works swiftly and without delay. That's a big ask since the cabin is quite large, but front passengers get relief in two minutes or less. The Limited's seat-cooling fans are noisy. The switch gear is big, logical and easy to use, but it looks ancient in 2019. It looked dated in 2009. The infotainment screen is laughably small, too. This off-road-biased 4x4 naturally comes with a higher step-up height relative to standard crossovers. Access to the front and rear is similar, but grab handles make it easier to gain leverage on entry. Shorter drivers will need to learn to spring up into the seats. The doors open nice and wide. The 4Runner offers an even higher, more commanding view than most crossovers. Drivers of all sizes will be able to find a good position, although adjustable pedals and more wheel telescoping would be appreciated. There's plenty of front head- and legroom for tall passengers, although the available sunroof consumes considerable headroom. The back has plenty of headroom but a bit less legroom. But the sliding and reclining rear seats should help even 6-foot-tall passengers find a comfy setting. It's surprisingly easy to see over the hood and toward the front corners, perhaps due to the simple and boxy design. There's good visibility out the back window, further enhanced by a backup camera. The rear quarters have the usual SUV blind spots, but a fairly level sightline out the sides offers good around-view visibility. The 4Runner has tight gaps outside and an attractive interior. The premium vinyl upholstery in most trims should be easy to clean, but it won't fool anyone into thinking it's leather. Only the Limited gets the real stuff, which looks good and should hold up over the long haul. For such a roomy cabin, there aren't many places to stash personal items. The door pockets can hold a slim water bottle and some smaller flat items. The center console is deep and wide enough for a cluster of wallets, phones, keys, small items and maybe an iPad Mini. You'll be hunting for stash spaces. The rear seatbacks fold flat, and it's easy to pack the sizable cargo hold (88.8 cubic feet with seats down; 46.3 cubic feet with seats up) because of its squarish shape. Car campers will love it since it's easy to stretch out a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Available slide-out tray is a unique feature that aids loading. A leather flap backed with Velcro covers the LATCH anchors, but it's easy to pull back and access them. Three tethers are located behind each rear seat. The roomy second row can accommodate car seats in any of the three positions, even bulkier rear-facing models. The square door openings make for easy access. Towing capacity is 5,000 pounds, a useful figure that covers most boats and many small camping trailers. But the 4Runner doesn't offer a factory electric trailer brake controller. You'll have to go aftermarket to add that capability. The navigation system is basic. Most smartphone-based nav apps are more powerful and sophisticated. The 6-inch display is small and there's no upgrade available. The JBL audio system is decent but lacks power and volume. There's no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, just Toyota's basic Entune app suite. But the USB and Bluetooth audio/phone connections offer a suitable workaround to the clunky Entune interface. There's a surprising lack of common driver aids such as blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, lane keeping assist, forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking. Many of these come standard on other Toyotas or are offered on competitors. The rudimentary controls require very specific syntax and speech patterns. Most drivers will have better luck using the voice assistants on their phones. Much  of the 4Runner's value lies in its go-anywhere capability. As such, we think  the TRD Off-Road Premium is the  sweet spot in the lineup. It's not as hardcore (or expensive) as the TRD Pro,  but its locking rear differential and available KDSS suspension help provide  off-road capability that few SUVs can match. At the same time, the Premium part  of its name indicates the many features that make this 4Runner trim a more  livable vehicle. The SR5 is the base model, but it's not  bare-bones. Standard features include 17-inch wheels, skid plates, foglights, a  rearview camera, heated mirrors, roof rails, a windshield wiper de-icer, a  power rear window, power front seats (eight-way driver, four-way passenger),  40/20/40-split reclining and folding second-row seats, cloth upholstery, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a 120-volt power outlet in the rear cargo  area. The standard infotainment system boasts a 6.1-inch touchscreen, one USB  port, and an eight-speaker sound system with a CD player, a media player  interface, and HD and satellite radio. Stepping  up to TRD Off-Road adds a locking  rear differential, slightly wider 17-inch wheels, Multi-Terrain Select off-road  settings and a crawl control function. The interior wears additional TRD  badging. The Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) feature is optional. Premium variants of the SR5 and the TRD  Off-Road get SofTex simulated leather upholstery, heated front seats,  navigation, an upgraded 6.1-inch touchscreen and an auto-dimming rearview  mirror. A sunroof is optional. Serious  off-roaders should consider the TRD Pro,  which starts with the TRD Off-Road Premium and adds revised front springs, Fox  dampers with internal bypass rear remote reservoirs, matte black 17-inch  wheels, all-terrain tires, a special front skid plate, a roof rack and special  styling. It also gains automatic headlights, LED foglights, the sunroof and a  15-speaker JBL sound system.The Limited model is more  luxury-oriented and sacrifices off-road capability in the process. It gets a  Torsen locking center differential (4WD models only), a full-time 4WD system,  and a separate suspension system Toyota calls X-REAS that's designed to reduce  body roll without hurting ride quality. The Limited also gains the TRD Pro's  extra creature comfort features plus 20-inch wheels, special styling, dual-zone  climate control, parking sensors, keyless ignition and entry, heated and  ventilated front seats, and leather seat upholstery. Power-deploying running  boards are optional.The  new Limited Nightshade Edition just  adds black exterior trim, replacing much of the Limited's standard silver and  chrome accents. ",

    "full_description": "The Toyota RAV4 gains minor interior trim changes for 2010. Spacious, comfortable and easy to drive, the 2010 Toyota RAV4 is a top pick for a small-to-midsize crossover SUV, especially if you want a V6 or a usable kid-size third-row seat. Toyota kick-started today's wildly popular small crossover segment 14 years ago with its RAV4, which introduced the novel idea of a car-based SUV. That original diminutive RAV4 has changed a lot since its introduction, though. Today's RAV4 offers a commodious interior with room for up to seven people, luxury features like leather upholstery and a navigation system, and an available V6 engine that cranks out more than twice the horsepower of the original RAV4's engine, yet gets similar fuel economy. While it has many competitors, the 2010 Toyota RAV4 should be among those on your must-drive list.After a more powerful four-cylinder engine was introduced last year along with some minor styling changes, the RAV4 heads into 2010 virtually unaltered. That's certainly OK, because it remains a veritable Swiss army knife of user-friendly transportation. The controls are simple and well-placed. The engines are powerful and economical. Storage spaces are abundant, and with all the rear seats folded, it can swallow more cargo than official midsize models like the Ford Edge. Passenger space is also excellent, with an optional third-row seat capable of accommodating a pair of kids.Competition in the compact/midsize crossover category is tougher than ever, but the RAV4 remains one of the most appealing entries. We'd recommend opting for the V6 model if you can swing it, though, as its robust 265 horsepower achieves basically the same fuel economy as the four-cylinder model. This engine alone has helped the latest RAV win multiple comparison tests.However, there are other options to consider. The new Chevy Equinox has a more upscale look and feel than the rather utilitarian RAV, while the Honda CR-V is also a bit nicer inside and more responsive to drive. The Subaru Forester is also worth a look for those who'd like some turbocharged punch. Still, the 2010 Toyota RAV4 exceeds in areas the others do not, and if you're searching for versatile, easy-to-use transport, it'll make an excellent choice. The 2010 Toyota RAV4 comes standard with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that delivers 179 hp and 172 pound-feet of torque. A four-speed automatic transmission is standard. Fuel economy with front-wheel drive is 22 mpg city/28 mpg highway and 24 mpg combined, and 21/27/24 with 4WD.Optional on all trim levels and coupled to a five-speed automatic transmission is a 3.5-liter V6 that produces 269 hp and 246 lb-ft of torque. In performance testing, the RAV4 V6 4WD delivered a 0-60 time of 7.2 seconds. The V6 achieves an impressive 19/27/22 for front-wheel drive and only 1 mpg fewer on the highway with 4WD.All RAV4s can be equipped with either front-wheel or four-wheel drive. In 4WD models, power is sent to the front wheels until slippage is detected, at which point power is also sent to the rear wheels. A true 4WD lock feature fixes the front/rear power split at 50/50, which is useful for driving in snow and for light off-roading. With the optional tow package, the RAV4 V6 can tow up to 3,500 pounds. Antilock disc brakes, stability control, traction control, whiplash-reducing front headrests, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags are standard on every 2010 Toyota RAV4. Vehicles equipped with the V6 and/or the optional third-row seats also come with hill-start assist and downhill assist control.In crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the RAV4 earned a perfect five stars for driver protection in frontal impacts and four stars for front passenger protection. It earned five stars for front- and rear-occupant protection in side impacts. The RAV4 also performed well in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests, earning the top rating of \"Good\" in both the frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. It achieved the second-best rating of \"Acceptable\" in the roof strength test. Although relatively capable off the beaten path, the 2010 Toyota RAV4 is meant for -- and succeeds at -- a life on pavement. Its taut suspension and precise electric steering make daily errands a pleasant, although not particularly interesting, experience. The RAV4 is not as responsive to inputs as the Honda CR-V or Mazda CX-7, but in trade, the Toyota offers a smooth ride that's forgiving enough for commuters who drive on crumbling expressways. Road noise can be an issue at times, but wind noise is well controlled.If we were to buy a RAV4, it would have to come with the optional V6, which generates nearly 100 hp more than most segment four-cylinders yet matches their fuel economy. The RAV's four-cylinder version is a reasonable choice for most buyers, though, as it provides adequate power for day-to-day driving. The RAV4's interior boasts a clean design with large, simple controls and lots of storage space. The cabin isn't as filled with plastic as previous-generation RAV4 cabins were, but it still has a budget feel compared to some competitors like the Chevy Equinox and Honda CR-V. Nevertheless, the Toyota is a model of practicality. The rear seats recline and can slide fore and aft to optimize passenger space or cargo capacity. Normal seating capacity is five, while the optional third-row seat bumps it to seven. Though this seat is meant only for children, it is at least reasonably sturdy and spacious.To configure the RAV4 for cargo, all you need to do is flip a lever. There is no need to remove headrests or fold up seat cushions to get a flat load floor that can hold a maximum of 73 cubic feet of cargo. This is bigger than several other midsize SUVs. The load floor is also quite low for this class, which minimizes the strain of loading a week's worth of groceries. However, the Toyota's side-hinged tailgate can be an inconvenience when you're parked on the street, as it opens toward the curb. The base RAV4 comes standard with 16-inch steel wheels, a limited-slip differential (front-drive models), air-conditioning, cruise control, full power accessories, keyless entry, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, driver seat height adjustment and a six-speaker stereo with CD player and auxiliary audio jack. The base V6 4WD adds 17-inch alloy wheels, though they are optional on other base models.The RAV4 Sport comes standard with 18-inch alloy wheels, color-keyed bumpers and sportier suspension tuning. The Sport Appearance package available on all four-cylinder and V6 4WD Sport models includes a spare tire-less rear door, run-flat tires, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, heated sideview mirrors and chrome exterior details.The RAV4 Limited switches to the regular suspension and 17-inch alloy wheels, and adds automatic headlights (optional on Sport), the heated mirrors, a hard shell spare tire cover, roof rails, keyless ignition/entry, dual-zone automatic climate control and an upgraded stereo with a six-CD changer and satellite radio (optional on base and Sport models).All V6 models add hill-start assist and downhill assist control, which are also standard on the four-cylinder with the optional third-row seat.Most of the RAV4's options are grouped into packages, but their content and availability differs by region. A third-row seat is optional on all models, as is a back-up camera. Options available on the Sport and Limited include a sunroof, a touchscreen navigation system and a premium nine-speaker JBL stereo with Bluetooth. The Premium package available on the Sport and Limited (but not with the third-row seat) adds leather upholstery and an eight-way power driver seat with power lumbar support. The latter item can be added separately on the Limited. V6-powered models can be equipped with a tow package.",

    "full_description": "The  2021 Toyota Sequoia is largely unchanged from the vehicle that debuted way back  in 2008. It's a truck-based full-size SUV, an increasing rarity as automakers  have rolled out smaller, more efficient car-based crossover SUVs. As such, the  Sequoia shares more than a little with the Toyota Tundra pickup, including a  powerful 5.7-liter V8. The stout frame and potent V8 give the Sequoia stronger  tow ratings than any crossover, and the large footprint means there's decent  passenger space. Toyota has released a steady stream of updates over the years,  adding revamped tech, a suite of driver aids and several packages that make the  Sequoia reasonably capable off-road. \nThose updates have helped keep the Sequoia from feeling too stale. Still, it's  hard to make a compelling case for it when you compare it to newer, much more  modern rivals such as the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon, Ford Expedition and  Nissan Armada. All of those ride on newer platforms, use more powerful and more  fuel-efficient engines, and feature tech that didn't feel behind the pack the  second it was introduced. While we like the Sequoia's generous cargo space and  genuine off-road credentials, we highly recommend giving the competition a  thorough look. It's more expensive, but the Toyota Land Cruiser is worth  checking out too. The  TRD Sport and TRD Pro trims are capable machines if you plan to do any  off-roading. But for most people, we suggest going with the base SR5 trim with the available Premium package, which adds features  including heated front seats and navigation. How does the Sequoia drive? Think of the Sequoia as a Tundra pickup with three rows and an SUV roof. It's got the same kind of effortless power from its big V8 engine, and that makes it well suited to towing trailers, boats and other toys. It also makes for easy highway passing when it's not pulling a load. That's backed up by our track-measured 0-60 mph time of 7.4 seconds, which is only a few tenths behind the class leader.\u00a0 \n\n   At about 6,000 pounds, and with light steering that doesn't have much road feel, the Sequoia isn't our first pick for winding roads. But it's surprisingly agile for its size, and the upgraded TRD Pro suspension should make hill climbs and descents a little more stable and add some confidence to braking maneuvers. How comfortable is the Sequoia? All-around comfort and surprising serenity are the Sequoia's main strengths. The seats don't offer much side-to-side support. They're basically just big chairs that provide solid long-haul support. The front seats, however, are limited in adjustments. We do like the Sequoia's plush ride quality. It absorbs impacts and shrugs off smaller bumps not unlike a luxury SUV. \n\n   Tire and wind noise is well suppressed, but you'll hear the engine straining when it's working hard. The height-adjustable suspension helps maintain comfort when you're hauling heavy loads. The air conditioning blows strong and cold in the back row, but it's oddly weak up front when all three zones are pumping. How\u2019s the interior? The Sequoia feels spacious, but you expect that given its size. Getting into the Sequoia's first two rows requires a step up, but the running boards and grab handles help. The second-row seats tilt and slide, making for easy third-row entry, but getting out requires a limber, deliberate effort, especially for tall adults.\n\n   There is plenty of room for heads, arms, elbows and shoulders all around. The downside is that the driver and front passenger will need to stretch to reach the touchscreen and stereo controls. The third row is narrow but offers good adult legroom. It's fine for short trips, but you don't really want more than six adults in this SUV. How\u2019s the tech? Next to rival systems, the Sequoia's infotainment is sadly outclassed. The updated 7-inch touchscreen media interface already looks dated, but at least the resolution and response are decent. Device connectivity has been improved by upping the USB port count to three, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now available. But functionality was iffy, often freezing or disconnecting during our two weeks with it. Additionally there are four 12-volt ports situated about the cabin for charging devices. \n\n   Active safety tech, on the other hand, is fairly comprehensive and it's all standard from the base model on up. Every Sequoia has automatic emergency braking, blind-spot and cross-traffic monitoring, front and rear parking sensors, lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control. However, competitors do have things such as lane keeping assist and adaptive cruise that works down to a stop. How\u2019s the storage? Utility is the Sequoia's game. Its cargo space, which is helped by two rows of fold-flat seats, is among the largest in the class and is arguably the key reason you buy a Sequoia. With 120.1 cubic feet of maximum space, it's only beat by the Chevrolet Suburban and the Ford Expedition Max. \n\n   With seats up, it's still impressive: 67 cubic feet with just the third row folded and 19 cubes of room for groceries with the third row up. A power liftgate enhances the ability to stuff the Sequoia full of gear. Slimmer plastic panels would increase capacity, but it's impressive as it is. The Sequoia offers so many nooks and cubbies that some personal items will disappear forever. How\u2019s the fuel economy? Our 4WD Sequoia TRD Pro gets an EPA-estimated 14 mpg combined (13 city/17 highway). The best tank we saw was 17.9 mpg during a long road trip, averaging about 17.5 mpg of mainly highway miles. Our previously tested TRD Sport, which has the same engine, returned 14.4 mpg on our 115-mile evaluation loop and averaged 13.6 mpg over all of the miles we drove it. That's not particularly impressive, but it is worth noting that we more or less matched its EPA figure, which suggests that the estimate is not overstated. Still, its 4x4 rivals are rated higher. The combined rating of the Ford Expedition 4x4 is 19 mpg, the Chevrolet Tahoe's is 18 mpg and the Dodge Durango's is 17 mpg. Even the chunky Nissan Armada bests the Sequoia with a rating of 15 mpg combined. Is the Sequoia a good value? While stout and capable, the Sequoia doesn't quite feel modern enough at this price. The interior feels dated, the updated tech is still below par, and its fuel economy ranks lowest in its class. The Sequoia's cabin materials are outclassed by its rivals too, and hard-touch plastic makes it feel more like a Tundra pickup and less like a more affordable Lexus.\n\n   Toyota's record for reliability and high resale value is definitely worth something, and the ownership perks such as free early maintenance are nice to have. If the Sequoia's aging interior design and its excessive thirst for gasoline don't turn you away, then the underlying value proposition gets a bit stronger. We can't recommend the Sequoia as a first choice; competitors are simply that much newer, nicer and better. But the Sequoia has a few things going for it: primarily massive interior room, a powerful and reliable engine-and-transmission package, oddly satisfying handling, and bulletproof Toyota construction. But compared to the more elegant Expedition, the stately Tahoe or rambunctious Durango, the Sequoia comes off a little boring and bland. \n\n   And while there's a bizarre, sadistic pleasure in trying to hustle the Sequoia through curves (excessive body roll means you'll reach its limits soon enough), it's more fun to simply point the Sequoia in a straight line and punch the pedal. It's also a great road-tripper.",

    "full_description": "For 2006, a tire-pressure monitor is now standard on all Tacomas. Revised SAE testing procedures have dropped horsepower and torque ratings. The 2006 Toyota Tacoma is far and away one of the best compact trucks ever offered to the American public. Long known for their durable nature, Toyota trucks have been on sale in the U.S. market since 1964 (remember the Stout, anyone?). Toyota introduced its sixth-generation truck, and anointed it with the \"Tacoma\" nameplate, in 1995. The first-generation Tacoma consistently attracted some of the youngest buyers in its class thanks to sharp styling, a bulletproof reliability record and its image as the perfect complement to a pair of dirt bikes or WaveRunners. It wasn't always the biggest or most powerful truck in its class, but when it came to delivering a complete package, the Toyota Tacoma rarely let its buyers down.Just last year, an all-new Tacoma debuted with across-the-board improvements. Whether it's engine power, interior room or safety features, the newest Tacoma has more of everything than it had before and even a few things it didn't. Like most trucks in its class, the truck comes in regular, extended-cab (Toyota calls it an Access Cab) and crew-cab (Double Cab) body styles in both two- and four-wheel drive. The 2006 Toyota Tacoma also continues with the popular PreRunner models that offer the look and suspension of the four-wheel-drive trucks sans the actual four-wheel-drive running gear. Also available is a long-bed version of the crew cab and the high-performance access cab X-Runner street truck. All regular and extended-cab models are available with either four- or six-cylinder engines, while the crew-cab models use the V6 exclusively. The X-Runner picks up where the old S-Runner left off, offering a sport-tuned pickup for those who want some utility without giving up the fun. It comes as a six-speed V6 extended cab only with a lowered suspension and additional structural bracing underneath that gives the truck its name. Even the least expensive 4x2 regular cab is outfitted with the essentials, including antilock brakes, a CD stereo and multiple power points. Even more impressive than the Tacoma's standard features is the overall design and comfort of the interior. With plenty of room in every direction, the Tacoma has lost much of the claustrophobic feeling so typical of most compact trucks. A composite cargo bed comes standard on all models and incorporates built-in storage units, adjustable tie-down anchors and even an optional 400-watt electrical outlet. The compact truck category has seen a rekindling of interest over the last couple years, as manufacturers court younger buyers with vehicles that are as functional as they are fashionable. With it's excellent revamp, the 2006 Toyota Tacoma is now firmly planted in the upper echelon of its class. All regular and access cab models are available with either four- or six-cylinder engines, while the crew-cab models use the V6 exclusively. Standard is a 2.7-liter, four-cylinder engine producing 159 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque. The 4.0-liter V6 engine serves up 236 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices include either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic for the four-cylinder, while V6 buyers can choose between a six-speed manual and a five-speed automatic. Equipped with the V6 engine, the Tacoma's maximum tow rating is 6,500 pounds. Antilock brakes with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution and BrakeAssist are standard on all Toyota Tacoma trucks. A stability control system is optional on all models, except the X-Runner. Crew-cab models also offer optional front-seat side airbags and full-length head curtain airbags. Hill-start Assist Control (HAC) and Downhill Assist Control (DAC) are offered on 4WD models equipped with an automatic transmission, stability control and the off-road package. While the standard four-cylinder is certainly adequate, the 4.0-liter V6 is a terrific all-around performer, with plenty of guts down low and a willingness to spin into the upper-rev ranges without getting thrashy. In terms of handling, the feeling behind the wheel of the 2006 Toyota Tacoma is of a truck that is well planted at every corner, predictable when pushed and surprisingly agile considering its size. The design of the dashboard controls and instrument cluster of the Toyota Tacoma mimics the 4Runner, which isn't a bad thing. The quality of the materials sets a new standard for the class, and the seats have the kind of firm, supportive bolstering not typically found on trucks of this type. Getting into Access Cabs is easy, thanks to dual rear doors that open wide, and the backseat of the Double Cab is comfortable for full-size adults. The 2006 Toyota Tacoma comes in three body styles: Regular Cab, Access Cab (extended cab) and Double Cab (crew cab). Each is available with two-wheel or four-wheel drive. Toyota also offers Tacomas with a \"PreRunner\" designation. PreRunners are 2WD trucks that have the looks and heavy-duty suspension of 4WD models. Toyota also offers a special 2WD X-Runner access cab sport truck equipped with the V6, a six-speed manual transmission, a sport-tuned suspension and additional structural bracing underneath that gives the truck its name. Standard features on the regular cab include a CD player, a full-size spare tire and a tachometer. Access Cabs add bucket seats, air conditioning and a pair of rear access doors. On top of that, the Double Cab receives keyless entry and power windows, locks and mirrors. An optional SR5 package on these Toyota trucks features color-keyed and chrome trim, intermittent wipers and upgraded interior trim. A JBL audio system with seven speakers is optional on Double Cabs. An available TRD Sport package includes performance suspension and upgraded tires, and a TRD Off-Road package features meaty tires and heavy-duty off-road suspension.",

The 2015 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a satisfying three-row crossover SUV that gets an unbeatable 28 mpg in mixed driving, but the up-front price might be a bit tough to swallow. If you want a family-friendly vehicle that gets impressive  mileage, the 2015 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is one of the best vehicles for the  job. Just like its gas-only sibling, the Hybrid is easy and pleasant to drive.  It's quick to accelerate, smooth-riding and one of the quietest vehicles we've  ever tested on the highway. It also has a pretty roomy interior with seating  for seven, high-quality materials and plenty of features. Of course, the added  bonus for the Hybrid is the excellent EPA-estimated 28 mpg combined rating for  fuel economy. The gas-only Highlander has just a 20-mpg combined estimate.\nHowever, with that refinement and fuel efficiency comes a  pretty hefty price tag. Toyota offers the  Highlander Hybrid in just the top two trim levels: Limited and Limited  Platinum. Those trim levels are well equipped to be sure, but even compared to  the gas-only Highlander versions, you'll be paying a premium of several  thousand dollars when new. The Highlander Hybrid even rivals many luxury brands  for price. \nStill, those able to stomach the cost will find the  Highlander Hybrid worth it, which is essentially what we concluded in our  Edmunds \"A\" rating of this Toyota. We also like  it more than its closest rival, the Nissan  Pathfinder Hybrid. The Pathfinder is less expensive, but it doesn't  match the Highlander Hybrid for acceleration or general refinement. (The  related Infiniti  QX60 is priced closer to the Toyota and is also available with a  hybrid powertrain and lots of luxury trimmings.) If seating for seven isn't a  requirement, check out the Audi Q5 Hybrid or Lexus RX 450h. There's no doubt,  though, that the 2015 Toyota Highlander Hybrid offers the best overall  combination of fuel efficiency, power, comfort and interior space in its class. The 2015 Highlander Hybrid is powered by a 3.5-liter V6  combined with multiple electric motors and a battery pack. Total output is  rated at 280 horsepower. All-wheel drive is standard, as is a continuously  variable automatic transmission (CVT). Under normal conditions, the hybrid operates as a  front-wheel-drive vehicle, but if wheel slippage is detected or serious  acceleration demanded, the rear axle's electric motor kicks in for full  traction and power.\nDuring Edmunds testing, the Highlander Hybrid went from zero  to 60 mph in just 7.9 seconds. That's a slightly quicker time than average for  a crossover this size, let alone a hybrid version.\nAccording to the EPA, the Highlander Hybrid returns 28 mpg combined (27 city/28 highway), which is  about as good as it gets for a three-row crossover.\nA properly equipped Highlander Hybrid can tow up to 3,500  pounds, or 1,500 fewer than the conventional Highlander V6. The 2014 Toyota Highlander Hybrid comes standard with  stability control, antilock disc brakes, hill-start assist, front-seat side  airbags, a driver knee airbag, a front passenger seat-cushion airbag and  full-length side curtain airbags.\nA rearview camera and blind-spot monitoring system with rear  cross-traffic alert and rear parking sensors are also standard, while the  optional Driver Technology package adds a frontal collision mitigation system  with automatic braking, lane-departure warning and Toyota's Safety Connect  telematics (emergency assistance, stolen vehicle location and automatic  collision notification).\nDuring Edmunds braking testing, the Highlander Hybrid came  to a stop from 60 mph in 127 feet, which is a few feet longer than average for  the segment.\nIn government crash tests, the Highlander Hybrid earned  five out of five stars for overall crash protection, including four stars  for total frontal-impact safety and five stars for total side-impact safety.\nIn crash testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway  Safety, the non-hybrid Highlander received the highest  possible rating of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset,  side-impact and roof-strength tests. In the small-overlap frontal-offset test,  it received the second-highest rating of \"Acceptable.\" Its seat and  head restraint design was rated \"Good\" for whiplash protection in  rear impacts. On the road, the Highlander Hybrid definitely feels large,  but it is still easy to drive on a daily basis. In city traffic, the 280-hp  hybrid system provides decent pickup, and the V6/CVT combination gives it some  real pep off the line. As with most hybrids, the regenerative braking system  produces a characteristically odd pedal feel that may strike some drivers as a  little touchy until they've acclimated.\nIt's worth noting that the Hybrid is around 350 pounds  heavier than a comparable gas-only Toyota Highlander. Nonetheless, the  Highlander Hybrid confidently handles the road within its predictably modest  limits. The steering has a firm, reassuring feel as well, but it can be a bit  heavy during slow-speed maneuvers. \nOf course, what you'll use the 2015 Highlander Hybrid for  most is ferrying passengers around in comfort, and that's where it truly  shines. The cabin remains impressively quiet at speed, and bumps and ruts are  generally shrugged off by the crossover's compliant suspension. While some hybrid vehicles may have unique interior  flourishes to set them apart from their non-hybrid counterparts, the 2015  Toyota Highlander Hybrid does not. Aside from the usual smattering of  hybrid-specific gauges and information screens, the Hybrid is basically a  Highlander Limited with a different powertrain. While this may be disappointing  to some -- especially considering the Highlander Hybrid's significantly higher  starting price -- the interior is nice enough to pass muster. Supple surfaces  cover the dashboard with subtle stitching at the seams. The Infiniti QX60  Hybrid's cabin might look and feel more special, but Toyota's modest deficit  here shouldn't be a deal-breaker.\nToyota has baked a number of handy storage features into the  2015 Highlander's interior. There's a unique built-in shelf on the dashboard,  for instance, that can serve as a resting place for phones and other small  personal effects. The shelf's short height, however, can make it hard to  actually fit your hand in there to place or retrieve those items. Vastly more  spacious is the storage box under the console armrest that's big enough for a  large purse.\nOperating the various electronics features has a very simple  feel, but they are positioned far away from the driver. The 8-inch touchscreen  provides crisp graphics, large \"virtual\" buttons and quickly accessed  mode buttons around its perimeter. The navigation system is intuitive as well,  while the audio system features the tried and true volume knob on the left and a  tuning knob on the right.\nSince the Hybrid only comes in Limited trim, it doesn't  offer the three-person second-row bench that's standard on lesser non-hybrid  Highlander models. The two captain's chairs are quite pleasant, however, and  they slide farther forward than they used to, permitting easier access to the  third row. Speaking of the way-back, adults will still find it cramped relative  to some rivals, but kids will be fine, and the three-across seating in the  third row bolsters the Highlander's credentials as a minivan substitute.\nEven though the Highlander Hybrid's cargo capacity is  diminished by its large battery pack, there's still considerable storage space  inside, especially once you start folding the rear seats down. There is a  usable 13.8 cubic feet of space behind the third row, expanding to 42.3 cubes  with the third row folded, and a maximum 83.2 cubic feet of capacity with both  rear rows folded. \nStandard features include 19-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof,  LED running lights, foglights, a flip-up rear hatch window, an adjustable-height  power liftgate, a rear spoiler, keyless ignition and entry, ambient interior  lighting, tri-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery (with  synthetic SofTex vinyl for the third row), heated and ventilated front seats,  an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar), a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, driver memory functions, a four-way power passenger seat,  driver voice amplification for communicating with rear passengers (\"Driver  Easy Speak\"), a second-row table between the captain's chairs and  retractable second-row sunshades. Electronic features include a navigation  system, a blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert, rear  parking sensors, a back-up camera, an 8-inch central touchscreen, smartphone  app integration (Entune App Suite), Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, and  a 12-speaker JBL  audio system with satellite radio, HD radio and iPod/USB connectivity. \nOptional for the Limited is the Driver Technology package,  which adds Toyota's Safety  Connect telematics (stolen vehicle locater, roadside assistance, automatic  collision notification), adaptive cruise control, a collision mitigation system  with automatic braking, a lane departure warning system and automatic high-beam  control headlights. A rear-seat Blu-ray entertainment system with a 9-inch  display is offered as a stand-alone option.\nThe Highlander Hybrid Limited Platinum (also known as the  Platinum package) includes all those items plus a panoramic sunroof, a heated  steering wheel and heated second-row seats.",

    "full_description": "Like its conventionally powered sibling, the Highlander Hybrid enters a new generation for 2014. Highlights include a larger, nicer cabin, the same 28 mpg EPA combined fuel economy rating as last year and a height-adjustable power liftgate. The 2014 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a satisfying three-row crossover SUV that gets an unbeatable 28 mpg in mixed driving. The price may give you pause, however. If you're shopping for a three-row crossover SUV with hybrid  power, you may have noticed that there aren't many options. Although the appeal  of carlike fuel economy in a sizable crossover is undeniable, the market hasn't  responded with a flurry of hybrid family haulers. But here's the good news: The  best-known option, the 2014 Toyota Highlander Hybrid, is fully redesigned this  year, and Toyota has made numerous improvements aimed at families who may have outgrown the  previous model. \nThe changes start outside, where the Highlander Hybrid is visibly  longer (by 3 inches) as well as slightly wider than before. Together with a new  rear suspension design that takes up less space, it all allows for a larger  third-row seat with room for three passengers instead of two. It's also easier  to get back there now, thanks to additional forward seat travel in the second  row. And while maximum cargo capacity has dropped, the standard  height-adjustable power liftgate with its separate glass hatch makes it easier to  load and haul your stuff without fuss.\nAs for the \"hybrid\" part, Toyota chose to carry  over the gasoline-electric powertrain from the previous generation. Still, with  280 horses on tap and an EPA combined rating of 28 mpg, there wasn't much here  that needed fixing. What did require attention was the aging interior design,  so the 2014 Highlander Hybrid thankfully shares the regular version's all-new  cabin, highlighted by upgraded materials, better storage options and a  tech-forward dashboard with a sharp-looking 8-inch touchscreen. When you get  out on the highway, you'll notice less noise and vibration, too. The Highlander  Hybrid is downright Lexus-like in the way it glides over the road.\nThe letdown here is the hybrid's pricing, which is also  Lexus-like. For many thousands less, the 2014 Nissan Pathfinder  Hybrid provides room for seven and nearly the same fuel economy, though  it can't match the Toyota's power or composure. Oddly, even the premium version  of the Pathfinder, the 2014 Infiniti QX60  Hybrid, undercuts the Highlander Hybrid's base price by a smidge. There's  also the regular 2014 Toyota Highlander to think about, because when you're saving a lot up front, paying marginally more  at the pump starts to make financial sense. But if you can comfortably afford  the 2014 Highlander Hybrid, it's an admirable all-around vehicle that's bound  to please. The 2014 Highlander Hybrid is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 combined  with three electric motors and a battery pack. Total output is rated at 280  horsepower. All-wheel drive is standard, as is a continuously variable  automatic transmission (CVT). Under normal conditions, the hybrid operates as a  front-wheel-drive vehicle, but if wheel slippage is detected or serious  acceleration demanded, the rear axle's electric motor kicks in for full  traction and power. \nAt the Edmunds test track, the Highlander Hybrid sprinted  from zero to 60 mph in just 7.9 seconds. That's a quick time for a crossover  this size, let alone a hybrid version.\nAccording to the EPA, the Highlander Hybrid returns 28 mpg  combined (27 mpg city/28 mpg highway), which is about as good as it gets  for a three-row crossover.\nA properly equipped Highlander Hybrid can tow up to 3,500  pounds, or 1,500 fewer than the conventional Highlander V6. The 2014 Toyota Highlander Hybrid comes standard with  stability control, antilock disc brakes, front-seat side airbags, a driver knee  airbag, a front passenger seat-cushion airbag and full-length side curtain  airbags.\nA blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert  is also standard, while the optional Driver Technology package adds a frontal  collision mitigation system with automatic braking, lane-departure warning and  Toyota's Safety Connect telematics (emergency assistance, stolen vehicle  location and automatic collision notification).\nDuring Edmunds braking testing, the Highlander Hybrid came  to a stop from 60 mph in 127 feet, a few feet longer than average for the  segment.\nIn government crash tests, the Highlander Hybrid received a rating  of five stars out of five overall, including four stars for total frontal-impact  safety and rollover tests and five stars for total side-impact safety.\nIn crash testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway  Safety, the non-hybrid Highlander received the highest possible rating  of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and  roof-strength tests. In the small-overlap frontal-offset test, it received the  second-highest rating of \"Acceptable.\" Its seat/head restraint design  was rated \"Good\" for whiplash protection in rear impacts. On the road, the 2014 Highlander Hybrid definitely feels bigger  than the vehicle it replaces. It's worth noting that the Hybrid is also around  350 pounds heavier than a comparable regular Toyota Highlander. Nonetheless, the  meaty three-spoke steering wheel inspires confidence, and within its  predictably modest limits, the Highlander Hybrid handles the road with uncommon  crispness and confidence. The steering has a firm, reassuring feel as well. But  the hybrid's regenerative braking system produces a characteristically odd  pedal feel that may strike some drivers as a little touchy until they've  acclimated.\nOf course, the 2014 Toyota Highlander Hybrid's bread and  butter is ferrying passengers around in comfort, and here it excels. The cabin  remains hushed at speed, and bumps and ruts are generally shrugged off by the crossover's  capable suspension, even with the standard 19-inch tires and their less  compliant, low-profile sidewalls. Over in the engine room, the 280-hp hybrid  system is pretty punchy, but the CVT tends to hesitate before opening the  floodgates, which makes the hybrid Highlander feel less responsive than the  conventional Highlander (which has an exceptionally good six-speed automatic  transmission). If you're expecting unique interior flourishes inside the  pricey 2014 Toyota Highlander Hybrid, we're about to burst your bubble. Aside  from the usual smattering of hybrid-specific gauges and information screens,  the Hybrid is basically a Highlander Limited with a different powertrain.  Happily, though, the Highlander's interior received an extreme makeover for  2014, and it's nice enough to pass muster at the hybrid's elevated price. Gone  are the bland hard plastics that used to cover the dashboard, supplanted by  supple surfaces with subtle stitching at the seams. The aforementioned Infiniti  QX60 Hybrid's cabin might look and feel more special, but Toyota's modest  deficit here shouldn't be a deal-breaker.\nA number of handy new storage features help the Highlander  Hybrid's cause. There's a unique shelf recessed into the dashboard, for  instance, that's a perfect resting place for phones. It also features a hole  that lets you feed in cords from the power point below. Also, the storage box  under the console armrest is much larger now, providing what Toyota describes  as enough room for a large purse (hopefully \"murses\" fit as well, since  the Highlander's styling is said to be manlier this time around).\nOperating the various electronics features is refreshingly  simple. The 8-inch touchscreen provides crisp graphics, large  \"virtual\" buttons and quickly accessed mode buttons around its  perimeter. The navigation system is intuitive as well, while the audio system features  the tried and true volume knob on the left and tuning knob on the right.\nSince the Hybrid only comes in Limited trim, it doesn't  offer the three-person second-row bench that's standard on lesser non-hybrid Highlander  models. The two captain's chairs are quite pleasant, however, and they slide  farther forward than they used to, permitting easier access to the third row. Speaking  of the way-back, adults will still find it cramped relative to some rivals, but  kids will be fine and the three-across seating in the third row bolsters the  Highlander's credentials as a minivan substitute. So does the novel \"Driver  Easy Speak\" feature, which uses the Bluetooth microphone to pipe your commanding  parental voice through the Highlander's sound system.\nWhen hauling needs arise, the Highlander Hybrid doesn't let  its ample battery pack get in the way. There are a usable 13.6 cubic feet of  space behind the third row (a notable improvement from the last generation),  expanding to 42 cubes with the third row folded and a maximum 82.6 cubic feet  of capacity with both rear rows folded. \nStandard features include 19-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof, LED  running lights, foglights, a flip-up rear hatch window, an adjustable-height  power liftgate, a rear spoiler, keyless ignition and entry, ambient interior  lighting, tri-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery (with  synthetic SofTex vinyl for the third row), heated and ventilated front seats, an  eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar), driver memory functions, a  four-way power passenger seat, driver voice amplification for communicating  with rear passengers (\"Driver Easy Speak\"), a second-row table  between the captain's chairs and retractable second-row sunshades. Electronic  features include a navigation system, a blind-spot monitoring system with rear  cross-traffic alert, rear parking sensors, a back-up camera, an 8-inch central  touchscreen, smartphone app integration (Entune App Suite), Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity and a 12-speaker JBL audio system with satellite radio, HD radio and iPod/USB connectivity.\nOptional for the Limited is the Driver Technology package,  which adds Toyota's Safety  Connect telematics, adaptive cruise control, a collision mitigation system  with automatic braking, a lane departure warning system and automatic high-beam  control.\nThe Highlander Hybrid Limited Platinum includes all those  items plus a panoramic sunroof, a heated steering wheel and heated second-row seats.

    "full_description": "The  2020 Toyota Camry provides the basic qualities you expect from this popular  sedan: a roomy cabin, plenty of trunk space, a comfortable ride and high crash  test safety scores. So far, so Camry. But some noteworthy additions make this  year's model more desirable than others. The first is all-wheel drive, which  has been absent from the Camry lineup since 1991 and should have particular  appeal for those in cold-weather regions. The  second is standard Android Auto integration. Toyota has been slow to  incorporate third-party smartphone integration, finally adding Apple CarPlay  just last year. Now the Camry comes standard with both pieces of software plus  Amazon Alexa for a truly complete smartphone experience. The  third big upgrade is the new TRD trim. While Toyota continues to offer the  sport-themed SE and XSE trims, the TRD bumps up the Camry's performance  abilities considerably. The Toyota Racing Development team has upgraded the  Camry's suspension components and customers have the option of adding summer  performance tires at no cost. The Camry TRD loses a little practicality  \u2014 a V-brace that stiffens the chassis extends across behind the rear  seats, eliminating the ability to fold them \u2014 but gains an  appreciable amount of street cred. As a sweetener, the TRD comes standard with  the Camry's smooth-revving and powerful V6 engine.In  a broader sense, it's true that the Camry isn't the best midsize sedan out  there. Other top picks such as the Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata and Mazda 6  offer various combinations of nicer interior materials, more enjoyable  base-model performance or simply greater value. But the Camry's continuous  improvements, history of reliability, and fiercely loyal customer base ensure  this family-friendly four-door remains popular with shoppers.Notably, we picked the 2020 Toyota Camry as one of Edmunds' Best Gas Mileage Cars for 2020.What's it like to live with the Camry?Because of its thoroughly overhauled cabin and redesigned exterior, the eighth-generation Toyota Camry was an interesting addition to our long-term vehicle testing program. We bought a 2018 Camry in the sporty SE trim and tested it for more than a year. To learn what it was like to live with, read our long-term test, where we covered everything from seat comfort to fuel economy. Note that the 2020 Camry differs slightly from that 2018 model, which did not have Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration, but our coverage is otherwise applicable.  The  L and LE prioritize value over all else, but the Camry is at its best in its SE and XSE trims. The SE is a cost-effective way to give the Camry some  pizazz, with eye-catching styling upgrades and a sport-tuned (but still  comfortable) suspension setup. If you're considering the Audio Upgrade package  \u2014 which is bundled with the Convenience package \u2014 it  doesn't cost much more to upgrade to the XSE. It includes that package plus  niceties such as heated front seats and leather upholstery. How does the Camry drive? We tested the four-cylinder Camry SE. Toyota has optimized it to get high fuel economy, but the trade-off is rather sluggish acceleration off the line. Our test car accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in an unimpressive 8.2 seconds, though it feels a little zestier than that in the real world. The transmission helps make up for this a bit with reasonably good response and quick shifting. With eight speeds, there's always a gear for the occasion, but expect two-gear downshifts when you dip into gas as it tries to make do with available engine power.    The Camry SE benefits from a slightly sportier suspension, which lends a more hunkered-down feel. It's not set up for truly aggressive driving, but it'll handle anything the average driver is bound to throw at it on a daily basis. The brakes are also easy to control with a light and responsive pedal, and the Camry's stopping performance is about average for the segment. How comfortable is the Camry? Big, comfortable seats and a smooth ride mean the Camry will suit a wide range of drivers even on long trips. Add in a powerful, easy-to-use climate control system that can cool the cabin effectively, even in triple-digit temperatures, and the Camry provides a pleasant cabin environment for any occupant along for the ride.     Its biggest flaw here is that the Camry lets in too much outside noise. You'll hear a prominent engine buzz when accelerating and noticeable wind and road noise at freeway speeds. The Camry is definitely noisier than average for a midsize sedan. How\u2019s the interior? The Camry's cabin won't wow you with its opulence but instead nails the fundamentals across the board. Highlights include an airy cabin that is easy to get in and out of. It's also spacious for both front and rear occupants and has great outward visibility. An optional 360-degree camera system makes it even easier to navigate cramped parking lots.    The user interface presents no mysteries, with large, clear gauges and simple, well-labeled buttons. They are relatively intuitive even for tech-averse drivers. The radio volume and tuning knobs are easy for the driver to reach, but they're a bit of a stretch for the front passenger. That could be a plus or minus depending on your passenger. How\u2019s the tech? The Camry's smartphone integration has improved with the addition of Android Auto for 2020. Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa were brought on board the previous year. The 7-inch infotainment system touchscreen is easy to read, and built-in navigation is offered on higher trims if you want it. Three USB ports and the option to add a wireless charger should provide plenty of charge for all occupants on the road.    All Camrys come with an impressive suite of standard driver assistance features such as adaptive cruise, automatic emergency braking and lane keeping assist. We found some aids too sensitive at times to prove really useful, but others, such as the optional surround-view camera system, are excellent accident-avoidance systems. How\u2019s the storage? As midsize sedans go, the Camry's stuff-hauling credentials are pretty solid. The 15.1-cubic-foot trunk area is large for the class. It also has a wide opening with a low liftover height. The 60/40-split back seat is easy to fold down via trunk-mounter release handles if you need to fit longer items.     There is a good amount of concealed cabin storage too. There's a sliding compartment underneath the wireless charger, a moderately sized center armrest bin, and a small storage cubby on the far left-hand side of the dash. Camry buyers with kids will appreciate the ample rear-seat room for car seat access and the easily accessible anchors. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The four-cylinder Camry's EPA fuel economy rating is among the best in its class at 32 mpg combined (28 city/39 highway). We measured 33.7 mpg on our standardized 115-mile evaluation drive route that provides a mix of city and highway driving. Edmunds also tested a Camry SE of this generation for more than 33,000 miles and observed an average of 29.8 mpg. Is the Camry a good value? The Camry is an easy-to-use, dependable and fuel-efficient vehicle at the expense of some excitement. It isn't as feature-driven as the Hyundai Sonata or as luxurious as the Mazda 6, but its design and variety of textures manage to be attractive without sacrificing functionality.    Toyota's warranties and after-care support are pretty typical, with a three-year/36,000-mile basic and five-year/60,000-mile powertrain coverage. That's nowhere near what Hyundai and Kia offer, but most other brands are in the same boat. The Camry doesn't disappoint, especially in SE trim. It won't replace a real sport sedan, but its pleasing driving dynamics are certainly welcome in this class of car. And with relatively aggressive styling, the Camry at least tries to shrug off the image that midsize sedans don't have to be boring.",

    "full_description": "For 2018, the Sienna gets a handful of key updates, including the Safety Sense package on all trim levels, updated Entune infotainment software, additional USB ports for rear passengers, and slightly revised front-end styling. For many people, the stigma of owning a  minivan is too much to bear. Instead, they turn their focus to the latest  crossover SUV. Shame really, since the minivan remains one of the most sensible  ways to move your family around. Sliding side doors, easy entry into all three  rows, and massive passenger and cargo space just make life easier. Crossovers  have their own charms, but they can't beat the overall versatility and  sensibility of vans such as the 2018 Toyota Sienna.  The  Sienna was last redesigned in 2010, but annual updates keep it competitive  against newer minivan rivals. For 2018, the Sienna gets a handful of key  updates. Notably, Toyota now includes its Safety Sense package on all trim  levels and no longer as an options group on midlevel and upper trims. These are  key safety and driver aids, too, and include automatic emergency braking, lane  departure warning and adaptive cruise control. While  the Chrysler Pacifica, Honda Odyssey and Kia Sedona all boast newer and more  modern designs, the Sienna continues to be a solid pick for a versatile family  hauler.Notably, we picked the 2018 Toyota Sienna as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars, Trucks and SUVs. While the Chrysler Pacifica, Honda Odyssey and Kia Sedona all boast newer and more modern designs, the 2018 Toyota Sienna is still a solid pick for a versatile family hauler. It offers seating for eight, a strong V6 engine and available all-wheel drive. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the 2017 Toyota Sienna Limited Premium (3.5L  V6 | 8-speed automatic | FWD).NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Sienna has received revisions that  include the addition of driver and safety aids such as forward collision  warning, automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control on all trim  levels, not just midlevel or top trims. Infotainment software has also been  updated, and SE and Limited trims receive upgraded glass for a quieter cabin.  Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Sienna.  Changes to the Sienna's powertrain for 2017 (a more powerful V6 and a new eight-speed transmission) provide tangible benefits to acceleration. Our Limited Premium test car dashed 0-60 mph in 7.4 seconds, quickest of any current minivan we've tested. Acceleration from a stop is smooth. The Sienna slows down smoothly, with a fairly soft pedal and linear braking force. There's not much initial resistance in the pedal, but it builds up as you lay into it. It stopped from 60 mph in 122 feet, average for the class but considerably shorter than multiple Honda Odysseys we've tested. Some road feedback transmits through the steering wheel, but otherwise the wheel is lifeless. Effort is light and lacks natural buildup. There's also no increased effort at higher speeds, which would aid stability. The Sienna exhibits noticeable body roll if you hustle it through turns. You'll need to slow down to keep your passengers happy. The Sienna SE, with its sport-tuned suspension, is more stable along twisty roads. Gas pedal response is poor in Normal mode unless the pedal is nearly pressed to the floor. The V6 has plenty of power in reserve (as evidenced when you select ECT Power mode), but you won't feel it under usual driving circumstances. The transmission is reluctant to downshift on uphill grades. The cushy seats are covered with soft, compliant leather. Some of our drivers had trouble remaining comfortable on longer trips, and found themselves making adjustments along the way. The extendable second-row leg rests are a nice touch. The Sienna glides down the highway, offering a supremely comfortable ride. It can get a little unsettled if you hit a bump in the middle of a turn, but that's the only real knock here. There's a great deal of wind and road noise, especially at highway speeds. The V6 operates at low rpm while cruising so you don't hear it much. It sounds pretty good at full throttle, too. The climate control system's gale force winds produce an extraordinary din. Trim rattles are not uncommon. Tri-zone climate control is standard across all trims, with vents above the rear outboard passengers. The heated steering wheel delivers effective heat, and the heated front seats get quite toasty on the highest setting. The perforated upholstery breathes adequately, but ventilation would be ideal. Many controls are awkwardly located, especially those for the rear entertainment system. The seat heater switches are hard for the passenger to reach with the dash-mounted cupholders deployed. The voice projection feature, which amplifies the driver's voice, is buried in touchscreen menus. Entry and exit through any door of the Sienna is a cinch. We'd only caution that the rear armrests are a bit flimsy, so don't try to use them to hoist yourself out. Exiting the third row is also simple. Using the strap or grab handle on the bottom of the second row slides it forward with ease. The driver's seat offers a wide range of vertical adjustment to accommodate a variety of body types. The front of the seat bottom tilts up high enough to provide thigh support for taller drivers. The steering wheel doesn't tilt or telescope much, so you might not be able to reach an ideal position. There's an ample amount of room up front, and the second-row seats slide all the way to the third row, though a sloping roofline reduces headroom the further you go back. There's enough legroom in the third row to accommodate adults, though taller individuals might find headroom a bit limited. The massive windshield and large windows provide an expansive view outward. The rear pillars aren't overly bulky, so you still have a wide view of the area directly behind you. The beltline rises a bit by the third-row windows but doesn't compromise the three-quarter rear view. The interior of our top-trim tester doesn't feel quite as nice as that of a comparable Chrysler Pacifica or Kia Sedona. With less than 10,000 miles, our Sienna tester had already developed a few creaks here and there, and the second-row sunshades vibrated when deployed. Twelve cupholders are placed throughout the Sienna   . Most notable are the two pop-out holders on the dash and two behind the center console that can slide and extend back to reach second-row occupants. The center bin in front is deep, and the third row has two decent-size bins. The load floor is fairly flat with the third row folded, and loading or unloading items is a cinch thanks to a low cargo liftover height in the back. The Sienna offers excellent cargo volume behind the third row and front row (with the second row removed). The second-row LATCH anchors are close to the front of the seatback, but the leather surrounding them is rigid and requires a little manipulation to push aside. Tethers are hidden on the bottom of the seatback. Some third-row anchors are difficult to access. The infotainment is simple enough to operate, but the touchscreen resolution is low, the screen washes out in direct sunlight, and the interface isn't particularly attractive. The rear entertainment display is a drop-down widescreen that can display one video across or two with a split-view screen. The Sienna is one of the older minivans in the segment, and it shows. As in other Toyotas, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not offered. You have to download Toyota's Entune mobile app and create an account to connect. It's a subpar solution for importing media. You previously had to pay a pretty penny for adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning, but all 2018 Siennas offer these features standard. The Entune system asks for commands using a set of predetermined phrases, but it does understand some natural speech. Siri Eyes Free is available for connected iPhones. Driver Easy Speak projects the driver's voice through the rear speakers. Great for when the kids become unruly. Although  a midgrade model, the Sienna LE has  most of the minivan essentials (tri-zone climate control, power driver seat and  easy-clean fabric upholstery) and optional all-wheel drive. But unless you  absolutely need wet-weather capability, go for the SE. It has worthwhile upgrades, such as sportier styling, leather  upholstery, a power liftgate and firmer suspension tuning. The latter makes the  SE the best-handling Sienna. There is a small trade-off in ride quality, but we  prefer the SE's more in-control feel. Standard  features for the base L include  17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, a wiper de-icer, tri-zone automatic  climate control, keyless entry, a rearview camera, a conversation mirror,  Bluetooth, smartphone-app navigation (Scout GPS Link), Siri Eyes Free, five USB  ports, a 7-inch touchscreen, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player,  media player interface and an auxiliary audio jack.Toyota Safety Sense also comes standard starting with L trims. It includes  forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency  braking, lane departure warning and lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise  control, and automatic headlights.The LE adds roof rails, power-sliding  rear doors, privacy glass, heated mirrors, an eight-way power-adjustable driver  seat, upgraded easy-clean fabric upholstery, rear sunshades, HD and satellite  radio, Entune apps (i.e., Pandora, iHeartRadio, Yelp) and telematics services,  and a Wi-Fi hotspot. All-wheel-drive versions get 18-inch wheels. The SE is equipped similarly to the LE  but adds a sport-tuned suspension, sharper steering, 19-inch alloy wheels, a  unique front fascia (foglights, LED daytime running lights and a mesh grille),  a noise-reducing windshield and lower body skirting. The SE also has a power  liftgate, first- and second-row leather upholstery (the third row gets premium  vinyl), heated front seats, and unique gauges with a larger driver information  screen. The SE Premium adds a sunroof, keyless  ignition and entry, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems,  a navigation system, a rear-seat entertainment system, and the Driver Easy  Speak system, which amplifies the driver's voice through the rear speakers. The  Sienna XLE shares many of the SE  trim's comfort and convenience equipment, but it features similar suspension,  steering and styling to the LE. It also adds a power-adjustable front passenger  seat, imitation-wood trim, power-opening rear-quarter windows, keyless entry  and push-button start. The XLE Premium adds the SE Premium's features and rear parking sensors. The  plush Limited includes the XLE  Premium's features (minus the rear entertainment system), along with 18-inch  alloy wheels, a different grille, LED daytime running lights, auto-dimming and  power-folding mirrors, front and rear sunroofs, noise-reducing side glass, and  front and rear parking sensors. Inside is first- and second-row premium leather  upholstery, driver-seat memory settings, a heated steering wheel, Toyota Safety  Connect emergency services, an in-dash navigation system, and an upgraded  10-speaker JBL surround-sound audio system. Front-wheel-drive models also get a  sliding center console between the first two rows, extendable footrests for the  second row, and a power-folding third row with faux leather upholstery. You  can add even more with the Limited  Premium trim, which tacks on xenon headlights, automatic wipers, a  surround-view parking camera system, the rear-seat entertainment system and  upgraded third-row leather (AWD only).Only  two option packages are available. For SE trims, the SE Preferred package adds  a sunroof, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, keyless ignition  and entry, the Driver Easy Speak system, and the in-dash navigation system. For  XLE trims, the XLE Navigation package adds rear parking sensors, Driver Easy  Speak and the in-dash navigation system. ",

    "full_description": "Full-size  trucks are more popular than ever, and the race to have the most luxurious,  advanced and gadget-filled machine is in full swing. Bringing up the back end  of this race, however, is the 2019 Toyota Tundra. Compared with the rest of the  segment, the aging Tundra is decidedly behind the times. For  starters, Tundra's only available engines are V8s \u2014 a 4.6-liter  engine that produces 310 horsepower and 327 pound-feet of torque or a 5.7-liter  engine that produces 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque. While we like the  5.7-liter's robust power, other brands are equipping their base trucks with new  turbocharged six- and four-cylinder engines. These smaller powerplants provide  significantly higher fuel economy and still have enough grunt to get a lot of  jobs done. The  lack of the latest features is another drawback for the Tundra. You can't get  advanced towing-assist technology (such as a remote-mount trailer camera  system) or Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration. And, for better  or for worse, the Tundra is still very much a truck. Its ride quality and  driving characteristics are rougher and less refined than what you'll find  elsewhere. Ultimately,  if all you need is a truck to haul cargo and tow a trailer without fuss, the 2019  Toyota Tundra should be on your list to consider. The available TRD Pro variant  is pretty cool, too. But we advise checking out the Ram 1500 or the Ford F-150  if you demand more civility and capability from your full-size truck. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the Toyota Tundra CrewMax 1794 Edition (5.7L  V8 | 6-speed automatic | 4WD).NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Tundra has received some revisions,  including an upgraded infotainment system and new driver safety aids. Our  findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Tundra, however. The Tundra's optional 5.7-liter V8 has plenty of thrust off the line and enough power to merge or pass on the highway. It isn't exciting like some of the other powertrains in the segment, but it feels robust. In Edmunds testing, our test Tundra did the 0-60 mph sprint in 7.1 seconds, which is an average time for a V8-powered truck. The brake pedal is numb and the truck is heavy. The combination provides little confidence during emergency braking situations. On mountain roads, the brakes can get overworked since they're an active part of the stability control system. In our brake test, the Tundra came to a stop from 60 mph in 134 feet \u2014 average for the segment. While driving the Tundra, you're constantly reminded of its sheer size. Nowhere is this more true than when you're gripping the steering wheel when going around a corner. You can place the tires well enough, but the steering wheel doesn't return to center well and the steering wheel diameter is massive. Handling feels ponderous and unsettled at times, especially on tight roads. By every modern pickup truck standard, this thing feels a generation old. Nearly every full-size truck around is more agile and maneuverable, both on curvy roads and in heavy traffic. The throttle delivery can be abrupt if you aren't careful with pedal pressure, but you can adjust pretty quickly. Otherwise, driving in the city and on the highway is easy, even with the old-school six-speed automatic transmission and the tow-friendly gearing. With genuine ground clearance and several available off-road read options, the Tundra is one of the most dirt-friendly full-sizes you can buy. Our test vehicle had the TRD Sport package, which is more aimed at on-road handling. But serious off-roaders should check out the TRD Off-Road package or the TRD Pro. These are some of the worst seats in a full-size truck today. They're stiff and poorly supported and they lack lumbar adjustment. They also don't go low enough, so even average-height drivers will always have fitment issues. They're barely passable on road trips, likely causing discomfort after just a few hours on the road. The Tundra does fine driving over small ruts. But over larger imperfections, it bobbles a lot. The ride is stiff and unforgiving. We imagine that would settle down with a significant payload in the bed, but unladen, it's hard to live with on a daily basis. This is the downside of a making 10,000-pound tow rating standard, not optional. It's possibly been made worse by our test truck's optional TRD Sport handling package. A decent amount of wind and road noise makes it into the cabin, even if it can be reasonably drowned out by music. Engine noise is nicely silenced at cruise, and it rises to a good V8 rumble (that's actually nice to hear) under full acceleration. Our relatively basic SR5 test vehicle didn't have as many creature comforts as other trim levels. Here you get manual, single-zone climate control, but it is easy to use because of its logical layout and big, easy-to-grasp knobs. No heated steering wheel and no heated seats at this level. The small vents mean you have to crank up the air conditioning to cool the cabin down in a hurry. The controls are large and well labeled with clear fonts. There are six main buttons next to the touchscreen and three main climate-control knobs. The Tundra may not have an upscale interior, but it is certainly easy to understand and use right away. A high ride height, no side steps, no grab handle for the driver and a tall seating position make it difficult to get in and out of this truck for drivers of almost any height. The rear doors are extremely long, so at least you won't be squeezing in. Purchase the optional side steps if you can. This truck's seat doesn't go down as much as some drivers would like. If you're of average height, you'll have a difficult time getting the seats or the steering wheel low enough. And if you're tall, the upper edge of the windshield and the folded sun visors can intrude into your field of view more than you'd like. Side to side, front and back, headroom and legroom \u2014 you name it, there's lots of it everywhere. Even before all of its competitors were redesigned and made bigger, the Tundra was one of the roomiest trucks in the class. The center console intrudes a bit on lateral driver legroom, but you hardly notice. Forward visibility is good but there's a big blind spot over both shoulders and the blind-spot monitoring system doesn't always see what's back there. Down the sides of the vehicle and at the front corners, you'll have a hard time knowing if you're set in a parking spot well. The side mirrors are sufficient if a bit slim. Build quality is OK, but we found issues with small items. The gas door wouldn't close all the way and most knobs and dials felt cheap, no matter how tight the tolerances were. There weren't any noticeable squeaks or rattles, or any large panel gaps, during our test. There's a lot of sheer interior volume, but the Tundra makes poor use of the space. The glovebox is small, as are the cupholders, and the center console lid only opens about 70 degrees, so access is tough. The doors have small, slim panels with two far-away can-sized cupholders in each. Not only does the rear seat have a large hump in the center of the floor, the rear seat bottom is massive and takes up lots of space. The raised platform underneath prevents the loading of flat items. The back seat offers lots of cubic space, but it's not laid out well. Fitting big cargo items is difficult. The back seat is massive in this Tundra so you can fit pretty much any child seat back there. And, as is typical on crew-cab full-size trucks, there are four lower LATCH points and three top tethers to attach child seats. Yes, the Tundra's maximum average tow rating isn't quite as high as the competition, but there are no asterisks here. Every single 5.7-liter V8-powered Tundra on the dealer's lot can tow about 10,000 pounds. This is not the case with the other full-size trucks, which force you to squint at a complex tow rating chart and buy the right axle ratio and tow package options. Good luck with that. Meanwhile, all 5.7-liter V8 Tundras comes standard with all that's necessary, including an integrated electronic trailer brake controller. Done, finito. The max payload rating for the Tundra is 1,730 pounds, which is competitive for the segment. The load-in height for the bed is very high, as are the sides of the bed and there are only four cargo tie-downs. There's no fold-out step, trick-folding tailgate or bumper step to make loading items easier either. Audio quality is a underwhelming. Yes, it has sound. Yes, it's decent at lower volumes. But the SR5's six-speaker stereo doesn't get very loud, and if you mess with the standard settings, bass get distorted easily. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren't available in the Tundra. There are three 12-volt outlets but only one USB port, and there's no options package that'll get you more. Bluetooth and USB audio connect relatively quickly on a consistent basis. On the plus side, and it is a big plus, the Tundra comes standard with adaptive cruise control (ACC), automated emergency braking (AEB), lane departure monitoring, drowsiness monitoring and automatic high-beam control. Blind-spot monitoring and cross-traffic alerts are easy to get. On the minus side, the ACC and AEB systems can overreact to neighboring vehicles with a lack of subtlety that can be annoying. Voice controls for music and phone calls work well but only under a very specific menu structure. After some time you can learn the structure and train the system to your style of speech, but it doesn't respond to casual language. iPhone users can use Siri Eyes Free to make calls, select music from their phone, and control certain other phone functions. Trucks  are all about utility, so our pick is the SR5 with the TRD Off-Road package and options. This aptly named package includes  the SR5's Upgrade package giving the truck functional off-road parts without  compromising on towing or hauling. It's the balance between work and play. Highlights  for the base SR include 18-inch  steel wheels, heated mirrors, a windshield wiper de-icer, a damped tailgate, a  rearview camera, an integrated trailer brake controller, a tilt-only steering  wheel, Bluetooth, a 6.1-inch touchscreen interface, and a six-speaker sound  system with a CD player and a USB port. It also includes forward collision  warning and mitigation with automatic braking, lane departure warning,  automatic high beams and adaptive cruise control.Going  with the SR5 gets you foglights,  variable intermittent windshield wipers, and an upgraded tech interface that  includes a 7-inch touchscreen, HD and satellite radio, traffic information and  a navigation app. The crew cab adds a power-opening rear window and an overhead  console.The  SR5's Upgrade package adds front  bucket seats with a power-adjustable driver seat, a center console (with  storage and console shifter), a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a larger 38-gallon gas tank when equipped  with the 5.7-liter V8. There's also a TRD  Sport package that adds 20-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, a hood  scoop, body-colored mirrors and bumpers, LED headlights and foglights, TRD  shift knob, floor mats and graphics.The Limited builds on the Upgrade  options package with 20-inch wheels, automatic headlights, movable tie-down  cleats, automatic dual-zone climate control, leather upholstery, an upgraded  power driver's seat and a power-adjustable passenger seat, a power  horizontal-sliding rear window (extended cab), a navigation system and  additional stereo speakers.At  the top of the heap, the Platinum trim  level comes with distinctive styling elements, LED daytime running lights,  power-folding and auto-dimming mirrors, a sunroof, heated and ventilated front  seats, driver-seat memory functions and a 12-speaker JBL sound system.The 1794 Edition really only differs  from the Platinum in terms of its exclusive exterior and interior styling  elements. A TRD Off-Road package can be added to  the SR5, Limited and 1794 Edition. It includes 18-inch TRD wheels, off-road  tires, LED headlights, trail-tuned shock absorbers, skid plates and tow hooks.For  better off-road performance, the TRD Pro trim features larger aluminum Fox shocks for better heat dissipation and  damping control, a 2-inch front lift for more clearance, lighter BBS forged  wheels, and LED headlights and foglights to help light up the trail at night. A  shiny black exhaust tip and TRD Pro exhaust change the exhaust note, while a  front skid plate prominently features the TRD logo in red. Visually, a unique  grille, TRD Pro stamping on the rear quarter panels, and a hood scoop separate  it from the rest of the line. On the inside, TRD Pro logos are pretty much  everywhere.",

    "full_description": "The 2010 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is unchanged. Combining available seven-passenger seating with excellent fuel economy, the 2010 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is an appealing alternative to conventional crossovers. We suspect a lot of folks would like to dump their old gas-guzzling SUV for a more environmentally friendly gasoline-electric hybrid, but can't quite bring themselves to give up the passenger- and cargo-schlepping capabilities their current ride provides. If that sounds like you, we think you'll like the 2010 Toyota Highlander Hybrid, as it solves this dilemma better than just about anything else on the road. With its fuel-efficient powertrain and available seven-passenger seating, the Highlander Hybrid offers current SUV owners a great way to limit their petroleum consumption without sacrificing the practicality they've become accustomed to.At the heart of the Highlander Hybrid's appeal is a gasoline-electric hybrid power plant that delivers impressive EPA fuel economy estimates of 27 mpg city and 25 mpg highway. Those numbers may fall short of the five-passenger Ford Escape Hybrid's (30 mpg city/27 mpg highway in comparable all-wheel-drive trim), but they still put the Toyota well ahead of seven-passenger hybrid SUVs like the full-size Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid and GMC Yukon Hybrid (21 mpg city/22 mpg highway). As for conventional gas-powered three-row crossover SUVs like the AWD Ford Flex and Hyundai Veracruz, the Highlander's 26-mpg rating in combined driving is over 40 percent better than their 18 mpg combined. The Toyota is also quick on its feet -- the sprint to 60 mph takes just 7.5 seconds.The Highlander Hybrid's advantages continue inside, where you'll find nearly as much cargo room as in the much larger Tahoe/Yukon hybrids. Notably, the optional third-row seat is best for kids, so if you need to carry more than five adult-sized people on a regular basis, the big GM hybrids or something like the Flex will be preferable. Still, the Highlander's third row offers an added measure of flexibility that family-minded buyers will appreciate.Price is one potentially significant drawback. Yes, the Tahoe Hybrid and Yukon Hybrid cost more, but comparably equipped conventional Highlander models list for thousands less, and the four-cylinder version (FWD only) even gets better gas mileage on the highway. Also, the Highlander Hybrid's AWD system utilizes a separate electric motor, so it's theoretically less capable in snowy conditions than the full-fledged gasoline AWD Highlander. Still, we recommend the 2010 Toyota Highlander Hybrid. It remains one of the best ways to reduce your fuel consumption without sacrificing true SUV-grade functionality. Powering the 2010 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a hybrid system consisting of a 3.3-liter V6 gasoline engine and a trio of electric motors. It all adds up to a healthy 270 horsepower, which is transferred to the pavement via a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) and an all-wheel drive system that uses a separate electric motor to power the rear wheels when there's a need for extra traction or acceleration.In performance testing, the Highlander Hybrid sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds, which is pretty quick even by conventional crossover standards. Properly equipped, the Highlander Hybrid can also tow trailers up to 3,500 pounds. This muscle is even more impressive considering its EPA fuel economy estimates of 27 mpg city/25 mpg highway and 26 mpg in combined driving. The city number is slightly higher because as a true two-mode hybrid, the Highlander can operate in electric-only mode at low speeds. The 2010 Toyota Highlander Hybrid comes standard with antilock disc brakes, stability control, front side airbags, active front-seat head restraints, a driver knee airbag and full-length side curtain airbags. Also standard is a hill-start assist feature that keeps the vehicle from rolling backward when starting off on a steep incline.In government crash testing, the Highlander Hybrid received a perfect five stars for driver protection and four stars for front passenger protection in frontal impacts. Side-impact testing yielded five-star ratings front and back. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the conventional Highlander its top \"Good\" ratings in both frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. The 2010 Toyota Highlander Hybrid features a smooth ride and secure if uninspiring handling, as one would expect from a Camry-based crossover. Road noise is nicely suppressed, and engine noise is reduced to a barely perceptible electric hum when the gas engine shuts off. The hybrid powertrain's lively performance and seamless transition between gas and electric modes adds spice and character as well as efficiency. A driver-selectable \"EV\" mode can propel the vehicle for short distances at low speeds on battery power alone, and hitting the \"Econ\" button softens throttle response to improve fuel economy. While the 2010 Toyota Highlander Hybrid's powertrain gets most of the attention, its cabin deserves its fair share of praise. In addition to seating up to seven passengers, the interior features decent-quality materials and a user-friendly control layout. The 40/20/40-split second-row seat slides fore and aft and features reclining seatbacks. It also incorporates a removable center section that can be replaced with a handy center table or stowed away to permit minivan-like walk-through access to the third row.The optional third-row seat is cramped compared to those of some larger crossovers, but it's useful for kids, and adults of short stature can squeeze back there for short trips. We wish the Highlander Hybrid's third-row seatback were split 50/50 to offer additional flexibility when carrying a mix of people and cargo, but at least it folds flat when not in use.For hauling purposes, the Highlander Hybrid offers a maximum of 94 cubic feet of cargo room with the second- and third-row seats folded. There's a healthy 42 cubic feet of stowage behind the second-row seatbacks. The base model comes fitted with 17-inch alloy wheels, a towing prep package, keyless entry/ignition, cloth upholstery, a tilt-and-telescoping steering column, air-conditioning and a six-speaker CD/MP3 stereo with an auxiliary audio jack. A 3.5-inch multifunction display shows trip computer functions and the image from the standard back-up camera.Spring for the Highlander Limited and you get 19-inch alloy wheels, auto-on/off headlights, foglights, a roof rack, a power liftgate with a flip-up rear window, leather upholstery, power-adjustable heated front seats, a two-person third-row seat, a rear cargo area cover, an auto-dimming rearview mirror with a compass, and a stereo with a six-disc CD changer and satellite radio capability.The options list for the base model includes the third-row seat, dual- or tri-zone automatic climate control (the latter only with the third-row seat) and a handful of other extras that are standard on the Limited. Options available only on the Limited include a voice-activated navigation system, a sunroof, a nine-speaker JBL audio system, Bluetooth and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.",

    "full_description": "All 2015 Venzas come with the same 6.1-inch touchscreen interface (albeit with split-screen, navigation and mobile-app functionality reserved for XLE and Limited), and a rearview camera is also standard across the lineup. Additionally, the towing package is standard on all V6 models, the entry-level LE is now four-cylinder only, and a simplified equipment roster limits options to a single package on the XLE. The two-row 2015 Toyota Venza is an intriguing wagonlike alternative to a variety of crossovers, but its dated design has it lagging behind in some respects. The Edmunds  \"C\" rating earned by the 2015 Toyota Venza shows just how  competitive the midsize crossover segment has become. A few years ago, the  Venza was one of our favorites, winning plaudits for its carlike feel and  generous standard equipment. Fast-forward to the present, though, and the Venza's  star has dimmed a bit, thanks largely to lackluster four-cylinder fuel economy and  a lack of some of the latest safety features. These weaknesses aren't new, but now  they're being exploited by fresher rivals that generally have more to offer.\nThat's not to say that the Toyota Venza is suddenly uncompetitive. On the contrary, its confident V6 engine  continues to be a class leader, and its technology offerings have been streamlined  for 2015 with a 6.1-inch touchscreen that includes enhanced infotainment  features and a rearview camera. As ever, we like how the rear seatbacks fold  easily at the pull of a lever to open up a large cargo bay, and passenger space  is ample in both seating rows. Moreover, the Venza's tall doors and low step-in  height make it a great fit for mobility-challenged shoppers.\nBut if you're looking for a two-row crossover in this price  range, there are others we'd recommend first. Chief among them is the all-new 2015 Subaru Outback,  which beats the four-cylinder Venza by a whopping 7 mpg on the highway, provides  relatively upscale interior appointments and even throws in one-touch folding  rear seatbacks to match the Toyota. Other fresh faces are the redesigned 2015 Ford Edge and  the 2015 Nissan Murano,  two more conventional crossovers that bring cutting-edge styling and technology  to the segment. The Venza still has some things going for it, particularly with  that excellent V6 under the hood, but overall it's past its prime by current  standards. The 2015 Toyota Venza LE and XLE start with a 2.7-liter four-cylinder  engine rated at 181 horsepower and 182 pound-feet of torque. The transmission  is a six-speed automatic. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive  available as an option. EPA  fuel-economy estimates check in at 23 mpg combined (20 city/26 highway) with front-wheel drive and a nearly identical 22 mpg combined (20 /26) with AWD. Most other four-cylinder crossovers return superior fuel  economy.\nOptional on XLE and standard on Limited is a 3.5-liter V6 that  pumps out 268 hp and 246 lb-ft. The same six-speed automatic transmission is  employed, with AWD optional on the XLE V6 and standard on the Limited. Fuel  economy is comparable to the four-cylinder at 22 mpg combined (19 city/26 highway) with front-wheel drive and 21 mpg combined (18 /25) with AWD.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, a four-cylinder Venza with front-wheel  drive sauntered from zero to 60 mph in 9.3 seconds, which is competitive with  the four-cylinder Outback and better than a four-cylinder Kia Sorento. A V6 front-wheel-drive  model was much quicker at 7.1 seconds, while a V6 AWD model needed just 6.9  seconds.\nWith the standard towing package, the Venza V6 can tow up to  3,500 pounds. All 2015 Toyota Venza models are equipped with antilock  brakes, traction and stability control, front side airbags, a driver knee airbag  and full-length side curtain airbags. A rearview camera and hill start assist  are also standard, but parking sensors are included only on the Limited.  Increasingly common safety technologies like blind spot monitoring, rear  cross-traffic alert and forward collision mitigation are noticeably absent.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, a four-cylinder Venza XLE came to  a stop from 60 mph in 120 feet. That's a shorter than average distance for a  midsize crossover with all-season tires, although a soft-feeling brake pedal  was also noted.\nIn government crash testing, the Venza received an overall  rating of five  out of five stars, including four stars for frontal impacts and five stars  for side impacts. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Venza its highest  rating of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset,  side-impact and roof strength tests. Likewise, the Venza's seat/head restraint  design was rated \"Good\" for whiplash protection in rear impacts. The 2015 Toyota Venza tackles corners with more composure  than expected, delivering carlike handling that does its Camry-based chassis  proud. That's partly down to the unusually large tires: 19-inchers with the  four-cylinder, 20s with the V6. The ride quality is still pretty smooth,  though, and it's complemented by low levels of road and wind noise, giving the  Venza a relaxed character at speed. The biggest disappointment is the  four-cylinder engine, which is much less powerful than the V6 but only a hair  more fuel-efficient, and makes a racket during hard acceleration. The familiar  V6, of course, is a gem, with gobs of civilized power on tap for passing or  merging. The Venza's front cabin is both distinctive and functional, highlighted  by a daring dashboard design with an integrated shifter that's carved stylishly  into the center stack. There's plenty of room below for a large console bin,  generously sized cupholders and smaller bins that are perfect for smartphones  and other personal items. The materials that Toyota selected are unimpressive,  however, comprising a mishmash of textured and smooth plastics along with unconvincing  fake wood inserts. The look is pleasing from a distance, but the quality isn't  there on a closer inspection.\nThe Venza's modest 6.1-inch touchscreen is hampered at times  by small virtual buttons, but it's easy enough to figure out, if less  graphically rich than some rival screens. We appreciate that FM/AM and satellite  radio presets can be mixed and matched, and available smartphone app  integration (standard on XLE and Limited) enables you to stream Pandora  Internet radio, buy movie tickets, reserve a restaurant table, read Yelp  reviews or even search the Web with Bing. As for the traditional controls,  they're quite user-friendly, consisting mostly of clearly marked buttons and  large knobs.\nAs noted, the Venza's large doors and low step-in height make  it an exceptionally convenient crossover for the mobility-challenged. The front  seats aren't especially comfortable on long hauls and could use more padding,  but the backseat offers ample legroom, with the added benefit of reclining seatbacks.  The cargo area measures a healthy 36.2 cubic feet behind the backseat, and flipping  down the rear seatbacks with the handy remote lever on the cargo wall reveals 70.2  cubic feet. \nThe LE comes standard with the four-cylinder engine, 19-inch  wheels, automatic headlights, foglights, rear privacy glass, a rear spoiler,  heated exterior mirrors, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, an  eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar support), a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and 60/40-split folding and  reclining rear seatbacks. Electronic features include Bluetooth phone and audio  connectivity, a 6.1-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera and a six-speaker sound  system with voice controls, a CD player, an auxiliary audio jack, iPod/USB connectivity,  satellite radio and HD radio.\nThe XLE adds power-folding exterior mirrors, a power  liftgate, keyless entry and ignition, driver memory functions, leather  upholstery, a four-way power passenger seat, heated front seats, an upgraded  trip computer and an upgraded infotainment suite with a navigation system and  smartphone app integration (including Bing, Pandora and Yelp).\nWhen equipped with the optional V6, the XLE also comes with 20-inch  wheels, dual exhaust tips and a towing prep package.\nThe V6-only (and all-wheel-drive-only) Limited shares those  extras with the XLE V6, and it tacks on xenon headlights, automatic high beam  control, LED running lights, a panoramic sunroof, front and rear parking sensors  and a 13-speaker JBL audio system.\nThe XLE can be equipped with the panoramic sunroof and JBL  audio via the Premium package. There are otherwise no factory options on any  Venza trim level.",

    "full_description": "Redesigned last year, the Camry is unchanged for 2008. Toyota has dropped the CE name from the base trim level. Like nearly every Camry before it, the 2008 Toyota Camry is pleasant to drive and spacious enough to keep a family of four content wherever their travels take them. But although it's still a solid choice, other sedans better this segment titan in terms of overall performance and cabin refinement. While various SUV nameplates have won and lost favor with consumers' changing tastes, the Toyota Camry's popularity has remained constant over the last decade. There's good reason for this, as the Camry has never wavered in its mission to be the perfect American family sedan. It's not perfect, of course, but the current Camry rates highly in most of the areas mainstream buyers will consider important: It's roomy, comfortable, safe and easy to drive. And when it comes time to sell it, you'll get a nice price for it.The 2008 Toyota Camry represents the second year of the nameplate's sixth generation. Although the car retains a midsize classification, this is the largest Camry ever and that fact is immediately apparent when you get inside: Headroom, shoulder room, hiproom and legroom are abundant in both the front and back. This is also the most powerful Camry ever by a wide margin. The optional 3.5-liter V6 engine develops 268 horsepower, and using the services of a smooth-shifting six-speed automatic transmission, propels the sedan to 60 mph in just 6.5 seconds -- as quick as some sport sedans and coupes. It also returns fuel economy that's not far off from what you'd get with the Camry's base four-cylinder engine.In spite of the current-gen Camry's speed, performance is still not among its major selling points. Instead, buyers are likely to notice how easily this family car executes passing maneuvers and maintains utter composure and serenity when going over just about any road surface. Handling is also sharper than on any previous Camry, although the car's abilities are masked by its ride-biased tires and lack of steering feedback. Truly, those seeking a truly sporting drive in a midsize sedan will continue to be better served by such cars as the Mazda 6, Nissan Altima and Subaru Legacy.However, for most consumers, it's cost rather than a lack of athleticism that tends to be the chief sticking point when they're shopping for a Toyota Camry. Properly equipped, the Camry usually ends up more expensive than most midsize sedans. That's hard to overlook when value-packed and worthy rivals like the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion and Hyundai Sonata are available. Also making things tougher for Toyota's big seller is its longtime chief rival, the Honda Accord, which has just been redesigned. The Accord may not be as hushed at freeway speeds, but it handily beats the Camry in terms of driving enjoyment and overall cabin refinement. Considering the amount of strong entries in this class, we suggest back-to-back test drives before making an automatic decision for the 2008 Toyota Camry. The standard engine on all trim levels is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder rated for 158 horsepower and 161 pound-feet of torque. In most states, the four-cylinder carries Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) certification. It meets the more stringent Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (PZEV) standard in California and certain Northeastern states, but has slightly lower output ratings -- 155 hp and 158 lb-ft. Transmission choices include a five-speed manual and a five-speed automatic, and buyers should note that four-cylinder Camry XLEs take the automatic only. Fuel economy ratings for the '08 model year are 21 mpg city/31 mpg highway with either transmission.For those seeking a faster Camry, Toyota offers a 3.5-liter V6 capable of 268 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed automatic drives the front wheels of all V6 Camrys. Fuel economy is rated at 19 city/28 highway. Every 2008 Toyota Camry comes with front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and a driver knee airbag. Antilock brakes with brake assist are also standard. Stability control (which includes traction control) is optional across the line. In crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Camry earned a perfect five stars in all frontal- and side-impact categories. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave it the top rating of \"Good\" after administering its frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. The base four-cylinder engine should be adequate for most buyers, though it's surpassed by the more potent four-cylinder offerings in the Altima and Passat. A more appealing choice for those with fewer budget constraints is the smooth and vigorous V6, which transforms the Camry into one of the fastest mid-priced sedans on the road. A soft, quiet ride characterizes the Camry's on-road demeanor, though the SE sedan's handling capabilities will likely impress you if you push it a bit. Still, the overriding impression is one of refinement and a somewhat isolated feel from the road compared to more athletic competitors. Toyota knows that the majority of buyers in this market segment are more interested in comfortable, stress-free travel than tearing through corners, and the refined and very capable 2008 Toyota Camry should prove a hit with them.Read our Toyota Camry Long-Term 20,000-Mile Test In base and LE models, the Camry's interior design is function-driven. Controls are oversized and neatly arranged, the seats are wide and capable of accommodating a range of body types, and there's a nice selection of cubbies and compartments to collect whatever personal effects that may be accompanying you. The seat fabric isn't much to look at, but it's durable and does a fine job of camouflaging lint and dirt. One of the few exceptions to Toyota's hyper-practical aesthetic is the uncharacteristically stylish ice-blue backlighting for the audio and climate controls. Camry SE and XLE models have different interior treatments that raise the sedan's style quotient. In particular, the cloth upholstery in four-cylinder XLEs is coated in silkworm cocoon extract, which makes it very soft to the touch. Additionally, rear-seat passengers in all XLE models can recline their seatbacks. Trunk capacity is 15 cubic feet in base and LE models and 14.5 cubes in the SE and XLE. Base Camrys include 16-inch steel wheels, air-conditioning, a six-speaker CD audio system with an auxiliary input jack, a tilt and telescoping steering wheel, cruise control, full power accessories and a 60/40-split-folding rear seat among its standard equipment. The Camry LE adds keyless entry and an eight-way power driver seat. The SE includes a sport-tuned suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels, and special interior and exterior styling details. The luxurious XLE reverts to the LE's softer suspension settings and 16-inch wheels while treating its occupants to a 440-watt JBL sound system with an in-dash CD changer, Bluetooth connectivity, an automatic dual-zone climate control system with a high-tech air filter, reclining rear seats, a moonroof, wood-tone accents and, on the V6 model, leather seating. Note that neither the SE or XLE offer folding capability for the rear seat, though each has a center pass-through.Most buyers' needs should be satisfied by the assorted trim levels; however, a few key options are available, including a navigation system and heated seats. A keyless start system is available on XLE V6 models.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota Camry has been one of the most popular vehicles around for decades, and the 2020 Camry Hybrid is simply a more fuel-efficient alternative to the standard sedan. It's not the most exciting car to drive, but the Camry Hybrid's fuel economy \u2014 up to 52 mpg in combined city/highway driving, according to the EPA \u2014 is the main draw. You'll also like the comfortable ride, roomy cabin and large trunk. If  you're in the market for a Camry Hybrid, we suggest going with the LE trim. It may be the entry-level  trim, but it comes with plenty of standard features. It also achieves the best  fuel economy in the lineup at an EPA-estimated 52 mpg. How does the Camry Hybrid drive? There's goodness in broad swaths with the Camry Hybrid. The sedan's power is decent in day-to-day use. In our testing, we measured a 0-60 mph time of about 8 seconds, which is slightly better than average for a midsize hybrid sedan. \n\n   Hybrid performance is smooth and care-free. Braking is predictable and very usable in everyday applications, and the low-rolling-resistance tires, which are common in this class, also provide average braking distances. Steering and handling are decent for the class. Overall, it does acceptably from a performance standpoint, but day-to-day commuting is its main strength. How comfortable is the Camry Hybrid? Comfort is where any midsize sedan should shine and the Camry Hybrid does just that. The climate control creates a welcome environment, and seating comfort is accommodating to a range of body types. The optional ventilated seats are a boon in warmer climates, and there's very little noise in the cabin coming from wind or the road while driving at highway speeds.\n\n   Our only nitpick is the XLE hybrid's ride comfort. While great around town, it can sometimes feel overly buoyant at highway speeds. The extra weight of the hybrid system is evident. How\u2019s the interior? Inviting, roomy and easy to live with are good hallmarks to have in such a competitive class, and the Camry has them all. The interior is easy to use, and all controls are readily within reach. The driving position is largely adaptable, and most people should easily find a comfortable driving position. Getting in and out of the vehicle is a cinch due to generous door openings, and there's a good amount of interior room for both front and rear occupants and excellent visibility for the driver. How\u2019s the tech? All Camrys have an impressive suite of standard driver assistance features. Some are a little too sensitive, however, and can't be turned off completely. \n\n   Smartphone integration has drastically improved since Toyota has equipped the 2020 Camry with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa. The audio system is also quite good and easy to learn and use. The 8-inch infotainment system touchscreen is also easy to read, and standard voice commands remain straightforward. The optional surround-view camera system takes a lot of guesswork out of parking. How\u2019s the storage? The Camry Hybrid retains a full-size trunk with no intrusion of a battery pack whatsoever. With the trunk open, you can't tell it apart from a standard Camry. Hybrid sedans usually force you to give up some practicality, but not this one.\n\n   The cabin offers a good amount of storage, from the sliding compartment underneath the wireless charger to a nicely sized center armrest bin, plus a small bonus storage cubby on the far left-hand side of the dash. There's also ample room for car seat access, along with easily accessible anchors for speedy installation. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA-estimated fuel economy of the XLE Hybrid and SE Hybrid is 46 mpg, which is very good for a midsize hybrid sedan. The base LE car returns an even more stellar 52 mpg. By comparison, the 2020 Honda Accord gets 48 mpg regardless of trim. We yielded about 42.4 mpg during our time with our XLE test car, which doesn't quite hit the mark but is still decently efficient. Is the Camry Hybrid a good value? Long the strong point for Toyota, there's good value to come from the latest Camry Hybrid. Traditional strong Toyota build quality? Check. The interior materials are a nice quality, and the hybrid matches well against the competition in standard warranty and ownership experience. \n\n   While the base Camry Hybrid is a little more expensive than the Honda Accord and Hyundai Sonata Hybrids, the starting MSRP for the top-spec Camry Hybrid XLE is very cost-effective for this class. The raft of standard safety features and stellar fuel economy are double wins for your wallet. This is as normal and middle-of-the-road as a car can possibly get, yet you get such a huge boost in fuel economy without the usual hallmarks of dare-you-to-buy-it styling and buzzy ride common to extremely fuel-efficient cars. It isn't fun to drive in a traditional sense, but it is fulfilling in the sense that you're doing something for the environment (if that's something you care about) and doing it in comfort.",

    "full_description": "Caution  is a prudent approach to life, and sometimes it is better to dip your toes into  the pool rather than to dive right in. If you've been thinking of giving an  electric vehicle a try, a plug-in hybrid is a good way to find out if EV  ownership could work for you. And the 2021 Toyota Prius Prime is one way to sample  EV living without committing to it completely \u2014 or spending a bunch  of money. \nDistanced  from the more popular Prius hybrid, the Prius Prime plug-in hybrid wears unique  styling details but uses the same five-door hatchback body style that's  characterized Toyota's fuel-sipper for nearly 20 years. The two cars share  interiors and equipment, though only the standard Prius offers an electronic  all-wheel-drive system as an upgrade from front-wheel drive.\nThe  primary difference between a Prius and a Prius Prime is the powertrain. With  the Prime, you get an estimated 25 miles of electric driving range at speeds up  to 84 mph. This is good for shorter commutes and running errands near home,  and, according to Toyota, you can easily recharge the battery in 5.5 hours  using a standard household outlet. If you're out driving and the Prime uses all  of its electric range, it automatically switches to gas-electric hybrid  operation just like a standard Prius.\nIf  you're wondering if you can live with an electric car, a Prius Prime is a good  way to find out. But it's not the only affordable plug-in hybrid, and you might  find some of the alternatives more appealing. Check out our Expert Rating below  to get our in-depth take on the 2021 Prius Prime. Within  the Prius Prime lineup, we recommend the XLE trim level. For a modest bump in price over the base LE trim, the XLE installs  synthetic leather seats, an upgraded infotainment system with an 11.6-inch  display, and a navigation system. It also offers longer free trial periods to  connected services and a driving coach that learns your habits and recommends  ways to improve efficiency. How does the Prius Prime drive? You're not buying a Prius Prime for its performance. In Edmunds' testing, our Prius Prime Limited test car accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 10.8 seconds, which is slow no matter how you look at it. Merging onto the highway or passing at higher speeds takes quite a bit of time, throttle and determination. We also tested its emergency braking performance. It stopped from 60 mph in 128 feet, which is slightly below average for a vehicle of this type. The Prime is also pretty tepid when it comes to agility and handling precision. \n\n   On the upside, the Prime has an easy-driving nature and smoothly transitions from EV mode to hybrid gasoline-engine power. And should you do most of your driving in EV mode, you'll find there's adequate acceleration for city traffic. How comfortable is the Prius Prime? The front seats are softly padded and should be comfortable for the long haul. Taller drivers, or those with long legs, might find the seat bottoms to be a few inches too short. The cabin is generally quiet unless you floor the gas pedal, at which point the underpowered engine gets rather raucous.\n\n   Another downside is the Prius' ride quality over broken pavement and concrete expansion joints. The impacts from these types of bumps can make the car feel jittery. Since the car is so quiet, this road noise is more noticeable than it would otherwise be in a non-hybrid. The climate control works well and has clever touches such as the ability to isolate the system in favor of the driver to aid in fuel efficiency. How\u2019s the interior? The Prius is a fundamentally easy car to get into and drive. Aside from the puzzling shifter design, all other controls are immediately familiar. The driver's seat has a wide range of adjustability, but taller drivers will likely want a bit more range of adjustment from the steering wheel. Space up front is expansive. Tall rear passengers will feel a little more cramped because of the Prius' sloping roofline. \n\n   Visibility is a mixed bag. Forward visibility is excellent, but the view over your shoulder is hampered by the thick roof pillars. Some drivers might also not like the view out back because of the split rear window design. The instrument cluster is also quirky because it's mounted in the center of the dash rather than being right in front of you. How\u2019s the tech? Our test Prius Prime had the upgraded 11.6-inch touchscreen display, which is a lot of screen real estate for a car in this price range. Unfortunately, it suffers from cluttered virtual buttons, unsophisticated graphics and clumsy menus \u2014 you'll be fine sticking with the base 7-inch screen. The native voice control system is unintuitive to use too.\n\n   On the upside, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration is standard, and sound quality from the upgraded JBL audio system is better than average. The Prime comes standard with a full suite of advanced driving aids too. Most of them work well, but the adaptive cruise control is very conservative. It's both slow to accelerate and quick to brake for other vehicles. How\u2019s the storage? The Prius Prime's cargo area is compromised due to the larger battery pack, which raises the floor and makes its 19.8 cubic feet behind the rear seats merely adequate. You can always fold the rear seats down if you need more cargo area; just be aware that the load floor isn't flat like it is in a standard Prius. Inside, there's enough in-cabin storage for the daily odds and ends. If you tend to fill your cupholders with personal items, you'll appreciate the large door pockets, which can double as water bottle holders.\n\n   Child safety seats are fairly easy to load in and out of the Prius Prime. LATCH points are easy to find, but the low rear roofline means you might have to stoop quite a bit to get seats and infants in and out. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Prius is known for its frugality, and the Prime adds the ability to travel an estimated 25 miles on electric power alone. After the battery runs out, you can expect to get 54 mpg in combined city/highway driving. We took our Prius Prime on our standardized evaluation route and traveled 27 miles on electric power and then averaged 63.3 mpg over the remaining miles on the gasoline engine. Both results indicate that the EPA estimates are easily attainable. Is the Prius Prime a good value? Our Limited trim test car stickered for around $35,000 and came with the larger touchscreen, a head-up display (displays important information in your sight line on the windshield), the upgraded audio system and a few additional driver aids. Overall, we think you get an appropriate number of features for your money.\n\n   Even though the Prius' interior feels well built, some cabin materials are a little too plasticky for its price. We're not particularly fond of the shiny plastic trim either \u2014 it tends to collect dirt, scuffs and fingerprints. As for warranties, Toyota gives you its regular coverage, which includes eight years/100,000 miles for the hybrid components. You also get Toyota's two free years of scheduled maintenance, and as a Prime owner, you get roadside assistance for three years. The Prius is not fun to drive, and it's doesn't feel particularly upscale. But it's easy to drive, practical, comfortable in the daily commute, and of course highly fuel-efficient. The Prius has become an icon representing an eco-conscious lifestyle and has defined what you should expect from a fuel-efficient car.\n\n   Should you find fuel economy data entertaining and want to turn the Prius into a first-person driving game to see if you can beat your driving efficiency score, you're likely to find the Prius Prime endlessly entertaining.",

    "full_description": "The  concept of the 2019 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is pretty straightforward. Take a  quiet, comfortable and roomy three-row crossover SUV, add a battery pack and  electric power for increased fuel efficiency, and \u2014 with a John  Madden \"boom!\" \u2014 you get a hybrid version of one of  America's most popular three-row crossovers.  \nLike  the standard model, the Highlander Hybrid comes with a generous features set,  including advanced driver safety aids such as automatic emergency braking and  adaptive cruise control. The cabin's spaciousness also extends to total cargo  capacity, which isn't compromised by the battery pack (as in some hybrids) and  doesn't force a choice between utility and fuel efficiency. \nThe  most significant difference between the two versions is the Highlander Hybrid's  powertrain. While the standard model offers a choice of four- or six-cylinder  engine, the hybrid comes exclusively with a V6 paired with electric motors. The  combination makes 306 horsepower and delivers 28 or 29 mpg in combined  city/highway driving, according to the EPA. All-wheel drive is standard, too. A  regular AWD Highlander posts about 22 mpg.\nIf  high fuel economy and utility are priorities, the Highlander Hybrid is an  obvious pick, not least for its capabilities. While the Highlander Hybrid does  cost a little more than a comparable regular Highlander, it also happens to be  one of the only three-row hybrid crossovers that don't wear a luxury badge or  have the attached luxury price. \nNotably, we picked the 2019 Toyota Highlander Hybrid as one of Edmunds' Best Gas Mileage SUVs for this year. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the Toyota Highlander Hybrid (3.5L  V6 hybrid | CVT automatic | AWD). The Highlander Hybrid responds quickly to pedal pressure when accelerating modestly. Full throttle unfurls a near-endless racket as the engine races due to the continuously variable automatic transmission. In our testing, we measured a 0-60 mph time of 7.5 seconds, which is average for a three-row SUV. Brake pedal effort is light and easy to use for regular stops or emergency braking. In panic stops, the SUV wanders and bobs from side to side. It's not very confidence-inspiring, but it behaves much better in routine stops. Not much feel can be discerned through the steering wheel, but it's well-weighted for a three-row SUV. There's a bit too much play around the center. Still, it's stable at highway speeds and exhibits low effort at low speeds such as when parking. The hybrid is surprisingly sporty for a 5,000-pound SUV and feels confident when bending into a turn. It can handle some speed into corners but only up to a point. The eco-oriented, all-season tires grip modestly, but few drivers will ever be inspired to take the Highlander to such limits anyway. The Highlander Hybrid feels more maneuverable than many other three-row SUVs. You'll notice its bulk in smaller spaces, but it's near flawless on long, open roads. Most times the engine is quiet, and the CVT automatic seamlessly blends electric and gas power. It doesn't have low-range gears, but a sophisticated AWD system, 8 inches of clearance, hill hold/descent control, and advantageous approach and departure angles give the Highlander admirable off-road capabilities for a unibody SUV. The heated leather front seats feel like living room chairs. They are built for comfort whether you're going the distance or grinding through traffic. The second-row seats aren't quite as soft but offer extensive slide/recline range. The third row is good for kids; adults will do OK back there but not for long. The Highlander Hybrid shines here. It's well-isolated from road rumble but still feels taut, without excessive up and down motions when driving over bumps. It shrugs off road rash and irregular surfaces to an impressive degree. It's pretty quiet at city street speeds, especially in those fleeting moments of EV mode (battery power only). At highway speeds, road and tire noise is well-suppressed, but you'll hear plenty of wind rushing over the windshield. The engine makes a racket under hard acceleration, however. A Lexus it's not. The control layout is easy to understand. The system heats and cools the cabin with impressive speed, aided by rear ceiling vents and independent temp and fan speed controls for second-row passengers. The seats are also quick to heat and cool, but the seat cooling fans are noisy even at the lowest setting. Controls arrayed near the steering wheel are easy to find and use. Every automaker should copy Toyota's dead-simple cruise control stalk. But the long stretch required to reach often-used controls (tuning knob, touchscreen) is getting old. Thoughtful icons show how to fold and slide second-row seats easily. The large doors and reasonable seat heights make for easy front- and middle-row entry. The second-row seats offer good slide travel and forward-folding for wide third-row access. Adults climbing in and out of the third row will need to be flexible, but kids shouldn't have a problem. A wide range of seat adjustments and the telescoping steering column allow most people to find a spot that offers a commanding and confident view of the road and over the hood. The cabin is big and accommodating where it matters. There is plenty of elbow room for the driver and front passenger and ample legroom for second-row riders. The third row is tighter but still livable for kids or short adults. This is a big vehicle with a limited view out the rear corners. It's disappointing that blind-spot monitoring does not come standard on the base LE trim. Despite an aging interior design, the Highlander Hybrid has excellent fit and finish and consistently tight panel gaps and seams. The doors close with a hollow thump that doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. The unique storage shelf built into the dashboard offers a resting place for phones and small items. It even offers a cord pass-through for charging cables. The massive deep center console is large enough to conceal a laptop or purse. The door pockets can accommodate most midsize bottles. Compared to rivals, the Highlander's 14 cubic feet of luggage space behind the third-row seats is a little stingy. The Honda Pilot and the VW Atlas offer more, for instance. But the 84 cubic feet of max cargo capacity is good enough for most cargo-hauling jobs. The second-row LATCH anchors are easy to find and access. Top tether anchors are clearly marked midway down the second-row seatbacks. There are no lower anchors in the third-row seats, but there is a tether anchor in the seatback. A properly equipped Highlander Hybrid can tow up to 3,500 pounds. Note that the conventional gasoline-powered Highlander can tow up to 5,000 pounds. The touchscreen user interface prioritizes function over form. Layout and menu structure are straightforward, but navigation looks like decades-old MapQuest graphics on a relatively low-res display (which tends to wash out in direct sunlight). The 12-speaker JBL audio system is pretty nice, however. A single USB port and dual charge-only ports keep the driver and front passengers happy, while rear passengers share three charge ports. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are notably absent. Entune smartphone integration requires an app, an account and Bluetooth pairing before use. It's cumbersome and unnecessary. You get an appealing set of standard safety features, including forward collision mitigation and lane keeping assist. Given the Highlander's size and limited visibility, we prefer that the blind-spot warning and parking sensors weren't restricted to the upper trims. Selecting the voice control button displays a list of phrases. The recognition software also recognizes natural speech, but it's not the best and often misses the mark with garbled translations. iPhone users are better off using Siri Eyes Free (accessed by a long push of steering wheel voice button). Although  the Highlander Hybrid comes well-equipped even at the LE base trim level, the  midlevel XLE is worth the stretch.  In addition to standard safety features, the XLE adds desirable features such  as blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, an upgraded 8.1-inch  touchscreen, leather upholstery, and a height-adjustable liftgate, among other  items. \nPower  comes from a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with three electric motors, generating  306 horsepower. All-wheel drive is standard. \nStandard  features on the base LE trim include  18-inch wheels, a windshield wiper de-icer, forward collision warning with  automatic emergency braking, lane departure intervention, adaptive cruise  control, keyless entry and ignition, a rearview camera, dual-zone automatic  climate control, a height-adjustable driver's seat, Bluetooth, a 6.1-inch  touchscreen and a six-speaker sound system. \nMoving  up to the XLE adds foglights, a  sunroof, a height-adjustable power liftgate, heated power-adjustable front  seats, leather upholstery, tri-zone climate control, second-row sunshades,  upgraded interior materials, a second-row household-style power outlet, an  8.1-inch touchscreen, satellite and HD radio, and a navigation system.  Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems also join the standard  suite of safety systems. \nThe  next step up is the Limited trim,  which adds 19-inch wheels, LED running lights, rear parking sensors, heated and  ventilated front seats with perforated leather, driver-seat memory functions,  second-row captain's chairs, a rear cargo cover, and a 12-speaker JBL sound  system. At the top of the range is the Limited  Platinumwith a panoramic  sunroof, automatic wipers, front parking sensors, a surround-view parking  camera system, heated rear outboard seats, and a heated steering wheel.\nThe  XLE and the Limited can be equipped with a rear-seat entertainment system.",

    "full_description": "The 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid is fully redesigned. The 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid is a solid hybrid family sedan thanks to improved fuel economy and enhanced driving dynamics. Can the most popular family sedan in America afford to take  a risk? Not likely. The 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid doesn't aim to find out,  either. Sure, the seventh generation of Toyota's bread-and-butter sedan shows a  sharper look, including a more aggressive front grille and side profile.  Tougher, more angular lines ring the exterior. There's even lip service paid to  sporty handling, an effort to woo buyers who've already written off Toyota as  the New Old Buick.\nThat's not where the changes end, however. For one thing,  the 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid offers an improved version of last year's engine:  a respectably powerful 2.5-liter four-cylinder that, combined with the electric  drive motor produces a total of 200 horsepower and by far the strongest  acceleration in its admittedly small class of hybrid sedans. An improved  regenerative braking system that converts more braking energy into electricity  also helps the new Camry Hybrid achieve an EPA-estimated 41 mpg in combined  driving (39 with the XLE trim) and a substantial 10 mpg gain in city driving.\nSuspension improvements have also enlivened the Camry  Hybrid's handling dynamics. That's not to say the new hybrid is particularly  sporty, but it does infuse slightly more enthusiasm into a rock-solid legacy of  cushy, comfortable ride quality.\nThe 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid offers a more refined hybrid  system than the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid  and essentially matches  the Ford Fusion Hybrid for best-in-class fuel economy. Overall, the Hybrid should be a solid,  blue-chip choice for a family car. The 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid offers a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine that produces 156 hp and 156 pound-feet of torque. An electric  motor brings the gas engine to life when it shuts down at stoplights in order  to save fuel and also provides some low-speed propulsion. Combined, the two  power units are good for 200 hp. A continuously variable transmission delivers  power to the front wheels.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, an XLE went from zero to 60  mph in 7.4 seconds, which is very swift for a hybrid family sedan.\nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the Camry Hybrid LE is 43  city mpg/39 highway mpg and 41 mpg combined. Interestingly, the XLE achieves  40/38/40 due to the higher rolling resistance of its larger wheels/tires. The 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid comes with a battery of  standard safety features, including antilock brakes with brake assist,  stability control, front- and rear-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain  airbags, and knee airbags for both driver and passenger, the latter new for  2012. A blind-spot monitoring system is also available.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Camry Hybrid came to a stop  from 60 mph in an excellent 116 feet.\nIn government crash testing, it received a top five-star  score for overall crash protection, four stars for overall frontal protection  and five stars for overall side protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway  Safety gave the Camry Hybrid the best possible rating of \"Good\" in  the frontal-offset, side and roof strength tests. The 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid is notably quicker and more  responsive than its predecessor. Thanks to revised suspension tuning, it also  feels more planted on the road and less disturbed by bumps. The electric  steering is also improved, but that's a relative conclusion, since it still  suffers from a lack of feedback and a light effort that doesn't instill the  same confidence as some competitors.\nIn terms of its powertrain, Toyota's hybrid system remains  the most sophisticated and refined on the market. The transition from  all-electric mode to the gasoline engine kicking on is less noticeable than in  the new Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, while its acceleration is surprisingly strong  for a gasoline-electric sedan. Inside the cabin, the revised interior for the 2012 Camry  feels slightly roomier. Thinner front pillars increase visibility and narrower  door panels open up elbow room. Door panel controls also move higher, allowing  knees to move more freely. But the most notable improvement has been in  interior materials. The previous mismatch of poorly fitted hard plastic has  been replaced with better construction and a more pleasing array of textures,  trim and subtle decorative stitching.\nMoving hybrid components from the trunk to under the hood  shrinks the battery housing, which in turn frees up additional space in back.  The trunk now offers a truly useful 13.1 cubic feet.\nThe Camry's new upgraded audio system also includes Entune,  a suite of smartphone-connected services that includes features like the Bing  search engine, Pandora streaming radio, real-time traffic, sports and stock  information, and the ability to reserve movie tickets or a table at a  restaurant on the go. \nThe LE features 16-inch steel wheels, auto headlights,  keyless entry/ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, power accessories,  cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, Bluetooth, six-speaker  CD sound system with auxiliary input and USB jacks.\nThe XLE adds 17-inch alloy wheels, heated exterior mirrors,  a leather-wrapped steering wheel, an eight-way power driver seat and a central  touchscreen interface and Bluetooth audio streaming.\nAdditional options are available for the XLE but can vary  depending on which region of the country you live in. These include a sunroof;  a rearview camera; heated front seats; a four-way power passenger seat; the  Display Audio system integrated with a navigation system, HD Radio, satellite  radio, voice recognition, Entune integration of smartphone and Web functions; a  premium 10-speaker JBL audio system; and a hard-drive-based navigation system  with a larger touchscreen display.",

    "full_description": "Toyota has completely redesigned the Highlander Hybrid for 2008. Although this hybrid crossover SUV is considerably larger than its predecessor, its gas mileage is just as good. Easily the most practical hybrid SUV on the market, the 2008 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a fully functional family vehicle that just happens to return better fuel mileage than other crossovers its size. Unlike smaller hybrid cars that offer readily apparent fuel economy benefits, the case for hybrid sport-utility vehicles is less clear-cut. On one hand, they promote wider acceptance of hybrid technology by virtue of their family-friendly packaging. As detractors are quick to point out, though, some hybrid SUVs aren't radically more fuel-efficient than their non-hybrid counterparts -- yielding benefits of the feel-good variety rather than measurable mileage gains. However, the improvements on the redesigned 2008 Toyota Highlander Hybrid are undeniable. In addition to being a larger, more flexible family vehicle than the original Highlander Hybrid, judged by the EPA's revised rating system, it's no less frugal with fuel.If you ever read up on the previous Toyota Highlander Hybrid, the drivetrain components of the new version will seem familiar. The main power source is a 3.3-liter gasoline V6 engine, which is rated at 208 horsepower in this application. With the propulsion assistance of two electric motors, one in front and one in rear, the '08 Highlander Hybrid produces a cumulative 270 hp. A third electric motor functions as a generator and engine starter. As in the past, Toyota's hybrid SUV has what the company calls an \"electronically controlled continuously variable transmission.\" This is not a CVT in the traditional sense and is instead a simplified power-split device that coordinates the efforts of the various power sources. Given the presence of the rear-mounted electric motor, the Toyota Highlander Hybrid is technically a four-wheel-drive vehicle. Most of the time, though, it functions in front-drive mode; the electric motor engages the rear wheels only when extra traction or torque is needed. Bear in mind that this setup differs significantly from the 4WD/all-wheel-drive system on the regular Highlander: There's no center differential and the V6 engine never provides power to the rear wheels. The upshot is that buyers shopping for a serious snow vehicle may not find the hybrid Highlander robust enough to meet their needs.For consumers living in milder climates, the 2008 Toyota Highlander Hybrid should prove quite practical. Its available third-row seat is roomy enough for adults in a pinch, and easy-folding second-row seats make it a cinch for 6-year-olds to seat themselves without help. Alternatively, they can just walk through the center aisle, as the 40/20/40 second-row bench has a \"Center Stow\" feature that allows you to remove and stow the center \"20\" section, leaving a pair of captain's chairs just like in a minivan.Although larger families will still prefer the added space of a real minivan or roomier crossover SUVs like the GMC Acadia and Mazda CX-9, Toyota's Highlander Hybrid should have considerable appeal for environmentally minded buyers. Indeed, with EPA estimates of 27 mpg city/25 mpg highway, this is the most fuel-efficient seven-passenger vehicle on sale for 2008. Toyota's Highlander Hybrid uses a 208-hp 3.3-liter V6 engine in combination with three electric motors. One electric motor functions as a starter-generator, starting the gas engine and recharging the SUV's nickel metal hydride battery pack, while the others concentrate on propulsion (but also work as generators during braking). Combined output is 270 hp, and with separate electric motors driving the front and rear wheels, the Highlander Hybrid is effectively a four-wheel-drive vehicle. A simplified CVT governs the contributions of the various power sources.During instrumented testing, a 2008 Toyota Highlander Hybrid accelerated to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds, which is fairly quick for a seven-passenger midsize SUV. Because the Highlander Hybrid makes greater use of electric propulsion at low speeds, its city mileage rating (27 mpg) is better than its highway figure (25 mpg). Every 2008 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is equipped with antilock disc brakes, stability control, front-seat side airbags, three-row side curtain airbags and a driver's knee airbag. In addition, a back-up camera is standard across the board.In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash testing, the Highlander earned a full five stars for driver protection in frontal impacts and four stars for the front passenger. In side-impact tests, it earned five stars for both front and rear occupants. In frontal-offset crash testing conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Toyota's midsize crossover earned the top rating of \"Good.\" Although it feels noticeably larger than the old model, the 2008 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is still pleasant to drive as midsize crossover SUVs go. Soft suspension tuning makes for a comfortable ride quality (even with the 19-inch wheels), and handling is capable, though not sporting. The electric power steering is low on feedback, but it allows Toyota's hybrid SUV to slither through parking lots with ease. And with both a gasoline V6 and a pair of electric motors working on your behalf, acceleration is brisk.For those more interested in economy than performance, Toyota has equipped the '08 Highlander Hybrid with both \"EV\" and \"Econ\" driving modes. In its EV setting, the vehicle functions solely on electric power, though naturally this works only at very low speeds and for very limited distances. More useful is the Econ mode, which restrains throttle response for the benefit of fuel economy: Switch it on in stop-and-go traffic and you'll never miss the extra power. Thanks to its longer wheelbase and wider track, the 2008 Highlander Hybrid is much roomier than the first-generation model, and larger and taller adults will feel the difference immediately. Build and materials quality remains high, and the ergonomics are excellent.All Highlander Hybrids have a 40/20/40-split second-row bench with both recline and fore/aft adjustment, as well as the nifty Center Stow feature, which allows you to remove and stow the middle section, leaving an open center aisle. The third-row seat folds easily into the floor, but its non-split design limits your options when you have a mix of children and cargo to transport. Like the regular Highlander, the Hybrid has just over 10 cubic feet of cargo space behind its third-row seat and 42.3 cubes behind the second row. With all rear seats folded, the Highlander Hybrid offers 94 cubic feet -- just 1 cubic foot less than the regular version. Options on both trims include dual-zone automatic climate control for the front seat and a choice of manual or automatic climate control for the rear seats. A third-row seat is available on the base model, while the Limited is further eligible for a sunroof, leather upholstery, front seat heaters, an upgraded JBL sound system (with Bluetooth included), a rear DVD player and a navigation system.",

    "full_description": "Toyota's large SUV is completely redesigned. The 2008 Toyota Sequoia is significantly larger than last year's model and boasts a powerful 5.7-liter V8 and a fold-flat third-row seat. A new high-line Platinum trim level brings Lexus-like luxury to the Sequoia lineup. Arguably the most useful, most refined and easiest to drive of the full-size SUVs, the 2008 Toyota Sequoia is an attractive option for large families with a boat in tow. When it comes to full-size SUV ownership, well, you really have to want it these days. Driving a large and imposing vehicle isn't as much of an image enhancement as it was a decade ago, and depending on where you live, spending $70 to fill the tank is a distinct possibility. That said, the current population of large, truck-based sport-utilities is as impressive as it has ever been. Incremental improvements in driving dynamics and interior packaging have made these heavyweights quite easy to live with on a daily basis. For families who can justify a vehicle of such size and capability, the 2008 Toyota Sequoia is worth special consideration in this field. It's completely redesigned this year, and in addition to being larger and roomier than before, it sets new standards for performance, road manners and seating flexibility.This transformation was made possible by the Sequoia's move to the current Tundra platform. Toyota's full-size sport-utility has grown longer and wider, and this is most evident inside the cabin. The second-row seats, which come in the form of a 40/20/40 bench or captain's chairs, offer a large range of fore/aft adjustment, allowing passengers to divvy up the available legroom. For now, the Sequoia is the only large SUV to offer this convenience, which should give it considerable appeal for growing families. Unlike its pickup truck relative, the Sequoia has an independent rear suspension, and this enabled Toyota to package in the all-important fold-flat third-row seat. This rearmost seat has a convenient 60/40 split, and with the second-row seats folded flat as well, this full-size SUV offers an impressive 120 cubic feet of cargo space.Although last year's 4.7-liter V8 returns as the base engine, most 2008 Toyota Sequoias will be sold with the new 381-horsepower 5.7-liter V8, which pairs up with a sharp-shifting six-speed automatic transmission. Thusly equipped, the Sequoia is easily the quickest of the large SUVs. It rides well, too. The precisely tuned chassis strikes a near perfect balance between highway comfort and back-road agility, while a relatively tight 39-foot turning circle makes the big truck easy to guide through parking lots. Available rear air springs help level out your load during heavier towing and hauling tasks, while Toyota's optional Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) provides a level of ride composure formerly associated with luxury sport-utilities.Buying a full-size SUV is not something families should take lightly, as large crossovers offer almost as much people- and cargo-hauling abilities while getting better fuel economy. However, for those whose situations necessitate one, the 2008 Toyota Sequoia is a strong candidate. You should certainly try the solidly qualified Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon twins and Ford Expedition as well, but when it comes to passenger accommodations, acceleration and handling dynamics, the redesigned Sequoia is tough to beat. Standard on the Sequoia SR5 is last year's 4.7-liter V8, which is rated at 276 horsepower and 314 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed automatic transmission is standard with this engine. Optional on the SR5 and standard on all other Sequoias is a 5.7-liter V8 good for 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque. The bigger V8 takes a six-speed automatic. Toyota says a 2WD Sequoia with the 5.7-liter V8 will hit 60 mph in an impressive 6.7 seconds. Properly equipped, this SUV can tow up to 10,000 pounds. The Sequoia is typical for this segment of vehicle in that it's available with four-wheel drive. An unusual feature, however, is that, like past Sequoias, drivers can lock the center differential in both 4 Hi and 4 Lo, thereby providing greater flexibility when driving in snowy conditions.In terms of fuel economy, the 2008 Toyota Sequoia has a slight edge over most rivals. The 5.7-liter is actually the more efficient option, thanks to its dual variable valve timing (the 4.7-liter only has variable intake valves) and the more efficient six-speed. A 2WD Sequoia 5.7 rates 14 mpg city/19 mpg highway, while a 4x4 rates 13/18 mpg. With the 4.7-liter, you're looking at 14/17 (2WD) and 13/16 (4WD). Every 2008 Sequoia comes with antilock disc brakes, stability control, front-seat side airbags and three-row side curtain airbags. Front and rear parking sensors are standard on the Sequoia Platinum and Limited, and optional on the SR5. A back-up camera is also included on the Platinum and optional on the SR5 and Limited. In Sequoias with a second-row bench, upper and lower anchor points for car-seat installation are provided in all three seating positions. In the third row, the center position has an upper anchor point. Even if you don't ordinarily like large SUVs, the 2008 Toyota Sequoia will chip away at your resolve, as the driving experience is quite pleasant. With the 5.7-liter V8 underhood, low-end torque is abundant, and passing maneuvers come and go in an instant. Plus, the six-speed automatic is always on its game with gear selection, even when towing. Ride comfort ranges from smooth and composed in an SR5 model with optional air springs to downright plush in a Sequoia Platinum with the adaptive suspension. Around corners, the suspension does a fine job of managing 3 tons' worth of SUV. The steering is well-weighted and precise, but doesn't quite provide the feedback of GM's Tahoe/Yukon twins. There's only one significant shortcoming in the 2008 Toyota Sequoia's cabin: It has the same impossible-to-reach audio and navigation controls as the Tundra pickup. Otherwise, this interior is a triumph of ergonomics, storage bins and family-friendly conveniences. You'll find a minimum of 16 cupholders in every Sequoia.Not only do the second-row seats adjust fore/aft regardless of whether your Sequoia has the bench or the captain's chairs, the seats will lock down into no fewer than 10 detents. This allows you to get pretty specific about the amount of legroom allotted to each of the rear rows. In addition, the bench seat's center \"20\" section slides farther forward to provide easier access to a baby. There's also a conversation mirror so you can monitor potential hostilities in the third row. The 60/40 third-row seat in Limited and Platinum models has both a power recline and a power fold feature.Luggage capacity behind the third row measures 19 cubic feet. With that seat folded, there are nearly 67 cubic feet. With both rear rows folded down, the Sequoia tops out at 121 cubic feet. Base SR5 models have 18-inch alloy wheels, full body-color exterior trim, a 40/20/40 second-row bench seat, triple-zone automatic climate control, a CD stereo with an auxiliary audio jack, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel and full power accessories. The Limited adds running boards, leather upholstery, power front seats, upgraded instrumentation, an upgraded JBL sound system, Bluetooth and heated mirrors. The ritzy Sequoia Platinum sizes up to 20-inch wheels while adding load-leveling rear air springs, the AVS adaptive shock absorbers, a power liftgate, a sunroof, heated/cooled front seats, second-row captain's chairs (dropping capacity to seven), a navigation system/back-up camera combo and a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel.Leather upholstery and JBL sound are optional on the SR5, while the rear air springs, sunroof and nav system are available on both the SR5 and Limited. Towing preparation and a rear entertainment system are optional across the board. Adaptive cruise control is an exclusive option on the Platinum.",

    "full_description": "The  Toyota Sequoia has been soldiering on for over a decade without any drastic  changes. It's still using the same Tundra-based body-on-frame design and  employing the same 5.7-liter V8 under the hood for power, paired with the same  six-speed automatic transmission. The exterior look has stayed the same, and  many of the cabin materials are beyond showing their age. It's not all bad,  though. Towing is still robust, there's plenty of space for passengers, and it  has real off-road chops. Unfortunately,  the fuel economy is middling, the interior design outdated and, until recently,  it was lacking in the tech department. Toyota attempted to bring the Sequoia  closer to the 21st century by adding  a new 7-inch touchscreen with smartphone compatibility, but it proved  underwhelming in our testing. However, the Safety Sense-P system is now  standard on all Sequoias, providing adaptive cruise control, forward collision  mitigation and lane departure warning. Blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert are also standard.Toyota  has also added a TRD Pro trim to the lineup, giving the Sequoia a bit more  street credibility and a step up on the competition when it comes to off-road  capability. The TRD Pro comes equipped with upgraded Fox shocks, skid plates  and cool blacked-out emblems. Plus there's significant ground clearance, and  this true body-on-frame truck platform will help take this hulking SUV pretty  far into the wilderness. Despite  its most recent additions, the Sequoia hasn't really leaped to the front of the  class. More recently redesigned competitors such as the Ford Expedition and the  Chevrolet Tahoe have it beat. But the 2020 Toyota Sequoia does have a lot to  offer for shoppers looking for a full-size SUV, especially with this round of updates. If  you plan on doing some serious off-roading in your three-row family hauler,  check out the Sequoia TRD Sport or TRD Pro models. But for everyone else, we'd  recommend the base SR5 Sequoia with the optional Premium package. You get all the Sequoia's standard  equipment such as Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, adaptive cruise control and lane  departure warning, as well as the optional stuff such as heated front seats and integrated  navigation. How does the Sequoia drive? Think of the Sequoia as a Tundra pickup with three rows and an SUV roof. It's got the same kind of effortless power from its big V8 engine, and that makes it well suited to towing trailers, boats and other toys. It also makes for easy highway passing when it's not pulling a load. That's backed up by our track-measured 0-60 mph time of 7.4 seconds, which is only a few tenths behind the class leader.\u00a0     At almost 6,100 pounds, and with light steering that doesn't have much road feel, the Sequoia isn't our first pick for winding roads. But it's surprisingly agile for its size, and the upgraded TRD Pro suspension should make hill climbs and descents a little more stable and add some confidence to braking maneuvers. How comfortable is the Sequoia? All-around comfort and surprising serenity are the Sequoia's main strengths. The seats don't offer much side-to-side support. They're basically just big chairs that provide solid long-haul support. The front seats are limited in adjustments, however. We do like the Sequoia's plush ride quality. It absorbs impacts and shrugs off smaller bumps not unlike a luxury SUV.     Tire and wind noise is well suppressed, but you'll hear the engine straining when it's working hard. The height-adjustable suspension helps maintain comfort when hauling heavy loads. The air conditioning blows strong and cold in the back row, but it's oddly weak up front when all three zones are pumping. How\u2019s the interior? The Sequoia feels spacious, but you expect that given its size. Getting into the Sequoia's first two rows requires a step up, but the running boards and grab handles help. The second-row seats tilt and slide, making for easy third-row entry, but getting out requires a limber, deliberate effort, especially for tall adults.    There is plenty of room for heads, arms, elbows and shoulders all around. The downside is that the driver and front passenger will need to stretch to reach the touchscreen and stereo controls. The third row is narrow but offers good adult legroom. It's fine for short trips, but you don't really want more than six adults in this SUV. How\u2019s the tech? Next to rival systems, the Sequoia's infotainment is sadly outclassed. The updated 7-inch touchscreen media interface already looks dated, but at least the resolution and response are decent. Device connectivity has been improved by upping the USB port count to three, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now available. But functionality was iffy, often freezing or disconnecting during our two weeks with it. Additionally there are four 12-volt ports situated about the cabin for charging various other devices.     Active safety tech, on the other hand, is fairly comprehensive and it's all standard from the base model on up. Every Sequoia has automatic emergency braking, blind-spot and cross-traffic monitoring, front and rear parking sensors, lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control. However, competitors do have things such as lane keeping assist and the adaptive cruise that works down to a stop. How\u2019s the storage? Utility is the Sequoia's game. Its cargo space, which is helped by two rows of fold-flat seats, is among the largest in the class and is arguably the key reason you buy a Sequoia. With 120.1 cubic feet of maximum space, it's only beat by the Chevrolet Suburban and the Ford Expedition Max.     With seats up, it's still impressive: 67 cubic feet with just the third row folded and 19 cubes of room for groceries with the third row up. A power liftgate enhances the ability to stuff the Sequoia full of gear. Slimmer plastic panels would increase capacity, but it's impressive as it is. The Sequoia offers so many nooks and cubbies that some personal items will disappear forever. How\u2019s the fuel economy? Our 4WD Sequoia TRD Pro is EPA-rated at 14 mpg combined (13 city/17 highway). The best tank we saw was 17.9 mpg during a long road trip, averaging about 17.5 mpg of mainly highway miles. Our previously tested TRD Sport, which has the same engine, returned 14.4 mpg on our 115-mile evaluation loop, and it averaged 13.6 mpg over all of the miles we drove it. That's not particularly impressive, but it is worth noting that we more or less matched its EPA rating, which suggests that the rating is not overstated. Still, its 4x4 rivals are rated higher. The combined rating of the Ford Expedition 4x4 is 19 mpg, and the Chevrolet Tahoe and Dodge Durango share a rating of 17 mpg. Even the chunky Nissan Armada bests the Sequoia with a rating of 15 mpg combined. Is the Sequoia a good value? While stout and capable, the Sequoia doesn't quite feel modern enough at this price. The interior feels dated, the updated tech is still below par, and its fuel economy ranks lowest in its class. The Sequoia's cabin materials are outclassed by its rivals too, and hard-touch plastic makes it feel more like a Tundra pickup and less like a more affordable Lexus.    Toyota's record for reliability and high resale value is definitely worth something, and the ownership perks such as free early maintenance are nice to have. If the Sequoia's aging interior design and its excessive thirst for gasoline don't turn you away, then the underlying value proposition gets a bit stronger. We can't recommend the Sequoia as a first choice; competitors are simply that much newer, nicer and better. But the Sequoia has a few things going for it: primarily massive interior room, a powerful and reliable engine and transmission package, oddly satisfying handling, and bulletproof Toyota construction. Compared to the more elegant Expedition, the stately Tahoe or rambunctious Durango, the Sequoia comes off a little boring and a little bland.     And while there's a bizarre, sadistic pleasure in trying to hustle the Sequoia through curves (excessive body roll means you'll reach its limits soon enough), it's more fun to simply point the Sequoia in a straight line and punch the pedal. It's also a great road-tripper.",

    "full_description": "Toyota  is doubling down on its popular large sedan and offering more versions of the  Avalon than ever before. For the first time in the nameplate's history, the  2021 Toyota Avalon will be available with all-wheel drive.  \nThere's  a catch, however \u2014 the new drivetrain will not be paired to the  existing V6 engine. Instead, the all-wheel-drive Avalon will borrow the  2.5-liter four-cylinder (205 horsepower, 185 lb-ft of torque) from the Camry  for motivation, or roughly 100 hp and 80 lb-ft less than the V6. However, its  competitors with AWD are almost exclusively powered by V6 engines, so buyers in  cold climates might feel let down by its lack of oomph.\nThe arrival of all-wheel drive isn't the only change to the 2021 Avalon. In-car  tech is improved with the addition of Android Auto and USB-C ports for charging  and connectivity. There's also a stylish and subdued XSE Nightshade Edition  featuring black-painted exterior accents. Finally, the sporty Avalon TRD gains  optional summer performance tires that should provide more cornering grip. How  well does it all stack up? Check out our Expert Rating for our in-depth  evaluation on this year's Avalon. The  appeal of the Avalon is its smooth and sophisticated ride, and the Limited trim best exemplifies that  experience. It's a step up in price from the base model, but it's surprisingly  less costly than the Touring or TRD. Yet the extra touches including authentic  leather and wood make it our pick of the bunch. How does the Avalon drive? With a potent 301-horsepower V6 mated to a smooth-shifting transmission, the Avalon has good power to get up and go. It is also pleasant to use in most scenarios, from long road trips and afternoon cruises to day-to-day commutes and short errands around town. Braking is consistent and never grabby, which lends to its comfort in daily use. \n\n   The Avalon is surprising in its athleticism \u2014 with shockingly enjoyable handling and drivability. While not a sport sedan, this cruiser can handle twisty roads with relative ease for a vehicle of its size. Think about a mobile defensive end or tackle in football as opposed to an athletic linebacker. How comfortable is the Avalon? Comfort is a strength for the Avalon and is probably the primary reason you'd consider such a large sedan. All seating positions give you ample cushioning and support for long drives or short cruises. The leather upholstery is very soft and gives the sensation that the Avalon is more upscale than its price suggests. \n\n   The ride is cushioned and makes you feel shielded from harsh roads. The cabin is also really cozy due to the climate control's quick heating and cooling. While there is no rattling or shaking inside the cabin, road noise is somewhat present at all times. How\u2019s the interior? The Avalon's cabin is a decent place to be. It is roomy and user-friendly. There are even redundant key functions located on the steering wheel. Legroom is abundant, the driving position is superb due to its multitude and depth of adjustments, and visibility is great up front and modest to the sides and over the shoulder. \n\n   As far as controls go, there are two minor issues: The radio tuning knob can be a reach for some, and a couple of functions, such as turning on the camera view, are tucked away. While legroom is a strength, headroom can feel a little compromised for taller people \u2014 especially in the rear due to the sloping roofline. Lastly, the low-resolution rearview camera and display could use an upgrade. How\u2019s the tech? Toyota's Entune system and its 9-inch touchscreen are surprisingly good. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration systems are supported. The display is bright and responds well to inputs, but Toyota tends to lock out more functions while you're driving than other carmakers. \n\n   There are two USB ports up front and two in back. The front console also houses a wireless charging pad. The car's built-in voice controls are hit-or-miss \u2014 it's better at understanding radio commands than navigation commands. We had much more success using Siri via Apple CarPlay. How\u2019s the storage? While cargo capacity is average on paper, the Avalon works out to be more convenient compared to some others due to the wide trunk opening, broad floor and convenient loading height. You might be disappointed if you're the type who folds the rear seats to expand the space because there's a sizable step up to the folded seats.\n\n   Inside, there are numerous small cubbies, plenty of cupholders, and a center console that's sizable and surprisingly deep. The door pockets are average, but there are enough other options that it's not a concern. The Avalon really shines when it comes to fitting child safety seats. The car seat anchors are easy to access, and the huge rear bench has space enough for just about any type of seat. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Avalon is rated at 25 combined mpg (22 city/31 highway), which is excellent for this class of car. It's not outstanding like the hybrid variant, but it's still really good. During our mixed-driving 115-mile evaluation route, we were able to observe 26 mpg, which slightly beat the combined EPA score. Is the Avalon a good value? The Avalon offers a good deal of quality and refinement. It feels close enough to the Lexus ES in this regard that someone looking for a large sedan might want to consider the Avalon instead because it costs thousands less. Beyond the great deal, you also get high gas mileage, a good roadside assistance program, and free scheduled maintenance for the first two years. The Avalon is a low-key performer. The exterior, aside from the huge brace-face grille, is nondescript, while the interior delivers a composed, civil and sophisticated style. None of this is bad, but it sets you up to be surprised by its hidden athleticism. In the context of a big family sedan, it's fun to drive due to its surprising handling capabilities and strong V6 engine.",

    "full_description": "In  many ways, the 2020 Toyota C-HR can be a case study in untapped potential. When  it debuted in the fledgling subcompact-crossover class, it benefitted from  sporty handling, plenty of standard features and youthful styling.  Unfortunately, none of these advantages could outweigh the C-HR's greatest  liability: an anemic engine and transmission pairing. Put bluntly, the C-HR is  one of the slowest vehicles we've tested in any class. A  short two years later, the C-HR's few advantages have mostly evaporated in the  face of newer rivals, pushing it out of our Top 10 rankings for subcompact  SUVs. For 2020, it gains Android Auto, gets some revised front-end styling and  loads up on more standard features, but these improvements aren't enough to  drag the Toyota C-HR from its lowly position. In addition to its poor  performance, it continues to suffer from an abundance of road and wind noise,  limited cargo space, and the absence of an all-wheel-drive option.If  you're looking to step up from hatchbacks or downsize from small SUVs, we  suggest passing on the C-HR in favor of our class favorites. These include the  Hyundai Kona, the Kia Soul and the Honda HR-V, all of which represent better  value and deliver significantly better performance than the 2020 Toyota C-HR. The  midgrade XLE trim gets our  recommendation. It brings keyless entry, blind-spot monitoring and larger alloy  wheels at a reasonable price. Shoppers in colder climates may want to step up  to the Limited, primarily for the heated leather seats. How does the C-HR drive? It's difficult to recommend a vehicle as sluggish as the Toyota C-HR. Its four-cylinder engine simply can't muster enough power to get the C-HR going with any authority. At Edmunds' test track, we logged a 0-60 mph time of 10.6 seconds. That's slower than other small crossovers and hatchbacks. It's even slower than a Toyota Prius.     But the C-HR holds its own in other categories. The brake pedal is easy to modulate, so it's easy to stop smoothly, and the steering is easy to twirl around at low speeds and accurate in sporty situations. The C-HR is also somewhat entertaining to drive on a twisty road even if there's a distinct lack of grip from the tires. How comfortable is the C-HR? The C-HR's seats are well cushioned and supportive, and the suspension smooths out most bumps in the road. The cabin of the C-HR is a pleasant place to be whether you're a driver or passenger.    That said, the C-HR isn't built for less than perfect conditions. We noticed that larger patches of rough pavement can easily upset the ride quality and create a lot of noise in the cabin. It isn't very well insulated from outside noise, and any wind gusts stronger than a light breeze are quite loud inside. How\u2019s the interior? Getting in and out of the C-HR is easy thanks to its elevated seating position. There's also plenty of headroom up front. The rear seats have enough room to keep regular-size adults in decent comfort, but the thick rear roof pillars may make them feel a little claustrophobic.     The C-HR's simple control layout is attractive, and the main controls are easy to operate for the most part. But some of the more advanced features such as the adaptive cruise control are a little more difficult to figure out. It's pretty easy to see out of the front of the C-HR, but those thick rear roof pillars obscure your view to the back. How\u2019s the tech? The C-HR comes with an 8-inch touchscreen that is simple to read and operate through the menus. It connects with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphones, and an effective navigation system is available. The audio system provides decent clarity, but the sound quality, especially for songs with thumping bass, quickly degrades when the volume rises.    We're fans of the driver safety aids included in the Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P) package, which is standard on all C-HR models. The lane-keeping alert system can be overzealous in its warnings when you're driving on a twisty road, but it's otherwise helpful. The adaptive cruise control is very good at reducing driver fatigue in heavy traffic and can bring the vehicle down to a smooth stop. How\u2019s the storage? Storage space is tight inside the C-HR. Rear trunk space is about average for the class at 19 cubic feet. You can fold down the rear seats to access 37 cubic feet of capacity, but that figure ranks low compared to the competition. Space for small items is adequate up front, though the center console is only average size. The cupholders are on the small side and awkwardly positioned.    Planning to put kids in the back? Car seat anchors are positioned well, but there's little room to install a rear-facing child safety seat without moving the front seats forward. Overall the C-HR is compromised by its quirky shape and size, and Toyota did not bring any of its trademark smart storage solutions to the table. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates fuel economy at 29 mpg combined (27 city/31 highway), which is about average for the class. We found the rating accurate, and even exceeded it with an average of 33.9 mpg on our 115-mile mixed-driving evaluation route. Is the C-HR a good value? The C-HR offers solid build quality and distinctive materials for the class. We also like the amount of standard safety equipment Toyota includes and the two free years of scheduled maintenance. But the C-HR isn't as affordably priced as some value-minded competitors. The distinctive styling alone earns Toyota points for bravery. Most people fall into one of two categories: They love the C-HR's design, or they hate it. Those who like it will find the rest of the vehicle filled with personality, from swooping dashboard lines to interesting trapezoid designs pressed into the ceiling. But just about everyone will find that the lack of power can sour the driving experience.",

    "full_description": "Crossover  SUVs might be all the rage, but there is still something to be said for the  tried-and-true midsize sedan. Exhibit A: the 2019 Toyota Camry. Coming off a  redesign just last year, the Camry is a spacious, fuel-efficient sedan with  lots of standard safety equipment and plenty of options to choose from.  As  has been the case for a while, you can get the Camry with a four-cylinder  engine or a more powerful V6, or you can get the miserly Camry Hybrid. On the highway, the Camry is  comfortable and compliant. Toyota also offers two sporty versions that infuse  the Camry with a bit of extra personality. Inside, the Camry offers a simple  yet feature-packed cabin, especially if you go with one of the upper trim  levels. There are plenty of options to choose from along the way. The 2019 Toyota Camry is as competent as they come. It's well-priced on the  whole, and modern feature content makes it supremely easy to drive. If you're  looking for something with a bit more class and space than a small sedan, the  Toyota Camry might just be the sedan for you.Notably, we picked the 2019 Camry as one of Edmunds' Best Midsize Sedans for this year.\nWhat's  it like to live with?\nBecause of its thoroughly overhauled cabin and redesigned exterior, the eighth-generation Toyota Camry was an interesting addition to our long-term vehicle testing program. We bought a 2018 Camry in the sporty SE trim and tested it for more than a year. To learn what it was like to live with, read our long-term test, where we covered everything from seat comfort to fuel economy. Note that the 2019 Camry differs slightly from last year's model, which did not have Apple CarPlay smartphone integration, but our coverage is otherwise applicable.  Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the Toyota Camry XLE (2.5L 4-cyl | 8-speed  automatic | FWD).NOTE:  Since this test was conducted in 2018, the current Camry has received some  revisions, including the addition of Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa  compatibility. Our findings remain applicable to this year's Camry, however.  Rev up the four-cylinder engine and it accelerates adequately. At our test track, our test car went 0-60 mph in 7.9 seconds. It's a willing engine, but it can sometimes feel lackluster at low rpm or around town. The pricey V6 option is a luxury, not a necessity. It's easy to modulate the brakes, and the pedal effort is appropriate for this class of car. It's not too firm or mushy. In our testing, the Camry stopped from 60 mph in 122 feet, an average result. The steering is suitably direct and well-weighted, with good on-center feel. It's not exactly sporty in terms of feeling the grip at the front tires, but it's certainly keener than previous Camrys. Sport mode makes the steering unnecessarily heavy. Handling is well-mannered within modest limits. It feels tidy for a car of its size in this class. Body roll isn't excessive, though it bobs vertically on bumpy, twisting roads more than we'd like. At modest cornering speeds, there's quite a bit of tire howl. The Camry SE versions provide sportier handling with a minimal loss of ride comfort. The eight-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly and quickly. Press on the gas at a stoplight and the Camry moves off with no lurchiness or pregnant pauses, making for a pleasant, innocuous driving experience. At first sit, the front seats feel flat, wide and overly cushioned. However, this initial impression dissolves quickly because long-trip comfort proves excellent. The back seat is upright with a flat bottom and modestly contoured seatback. The Camry is buttoned-down for the most part. Typical pavement bumps, whether large or small, are soaked up nicely. The ride is never what we'd call wallowy or floaty, but it can exhibit some excessive vertical ride motions on bumpy roads. The Camry is not a serenely quiet car. The engine can be buzzy and coarse during acceleration, but it does fade into the background when cruising. There's a whiff of wind noise and some tire-related road noise, too. With two knobs for temperature and buttons for other controls, the Camry has a simple and straightforward layout for its climate controls. The system cools down the cabin effectively, even in triple-digit heat. That it operates very quietly makes it even better. The back seat gets two vents as part of an option package. The Camry doesn't make anything a mystery. The clear, large gauges and simple, well-labeled buttons make it intuitive for anyone to operate. The radio volume and tuning knobs are easy for the driver to reach, but they are a bit of a stretch for the passenger. Typical of Toyotas, the Camry is easy to get into and out of. It has very light doors, narrow sills and sizable door openings. Taller drivers will be pleased with the reach of the telescoping wheel. A generously sized driver footwell and an appropriate distance from the steering wheel to the pedals and seat make the Camry very comfortable to pilot. The cabin feels airy with ample headroom and legroom for 6-plus-footers. Although there's plenty of legroom for 6-footers, their heads may brush up on the roof a little. A low-ish beltline and slim roof pillars aid the view forward and out the front side windows. There is decent visibility over your shoulder and out the back window, too. An optional top-view camera system provides a clear and comprehensive depiction of the surroundings. Soft-touch surfaces abound, and they look and feel good. Its design and variety of textures won't be mistaken for those of a luxury car, but they're attractive without sacrificing functionality. Cabin storage is good but not stellar. The forward center console bin is great for concealing items but has a hard, slippery floor, so they slide around noisily. The console bin at your elbow is a decent size, and there are modest door pockets in the front and rear that are good for small water bottles only. The Camry has a large trunk, and the 60/40-split folding back seat with trunk-mounted release handles make it easy to expand the space. Loading groceries or luggage is helped out by the wide opening and a low liftover height. It's very easy to mount a car seat, with obvious and easily accessible lower anchors and package tray-mounted tether point, both under plastic covers. There's enough space so that the front seat need not be scooted all the way forward. The audio system layout is simple and effective, with chunky, well-labeled buttons and a clear display even in direct sun. However, built-in navigation is hard to get on the Camry. On most models, Toyota instead forces you to pair a phone via the Entune app and then use the approved Scout GPS Link app to get navigation. Bluetooth audio is straightforward, but Toyota's Entune system requires that the user pairs Bluetooth and connect a cord to use all its features. It feels clunky at first but reconnects quickly on subsequent visits. Apple CarPlay is standard this year, but Android Auto is not available. Its many standard driver aids are impressive: adaptive cruise, automatic emergency braking and lane keeping assist. But the lane departure warnings are overly sensitive and cannot be turned off. Pre-collision system proved too sensitive during routine parking maneuvers and certain acceleration events. Voice commands work well if you go through the setup process that teaches the car your speech patterns. Or you can use Siri Eyes Free on your paired smartphone by pressing and holding the voice button. It's a good alternative, and you don't have to run the Entune app to make it work. Get  the midlevel SE trim. The SE has a  sport-tuned suspension for better handling. Don't worry about a stiff ride, though  \u2014 the SE is still relatively comfortable on the road. The SE is also  a good bargain considering all the safety and tech equipment you get for the  money. Finally, the SE is available with a wide range of options, so you can  pick and choose which ones are right for your budget.  Toyota Camry L The  Camry L is the base trim. It comes  with a relatively light load of features that includes 16-inch steel wheels,  automatic LED headlights, cloth upholstery, a height-adjustable driver's seat,  a rearview camera, keyless entry, a 7-inch touchscreen interface, navigation  (GPS Scout Link), Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa connectivity, one USB port,  Bluetooth, a Wi-Fi hotspot, and a six-speaker sound system.  Standard  on every Camry is Toyota Safety Sense, which is a suite of driver assistance  features including adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with  automatic emergency braking, lane departure alert with steering assistance, and  automatic high beams. Toyota Camry LE and SE On  the next rung up the ladder is the LE.  It adds a power-adjustable driver's seat, 17-inch alloy wheels, a 60/40-split  folding back seat and a car alarm. For a sporty dynamic, look at the SE. It adds a sport-tuned suspension,  revised steering calibration, 18-inch wheels, simulated-leather upholstery  (SofTex) seats and paddle shifters. Toyota Camry XLE and the XSE You  can think of the XLE and the XSE trim levels as versions of the LE  and the SE, respectively, with a variety of additional comfort and convenience  items. Highlights include larger wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control,  leather upholstery, a head-up display, blind-spot monitoring, keyless ignition,  a power-adjustable front passenger seat, extra USB ports, a bigger 8-inch  touchscreen, and wireless smartphone charging. Many  of the features found on the upper trim levels can be added to the lower trim  levels as options. Other notable options include a sunroof, a JBL sound system  combined with a built-in navigation system, a head-up display, and a top-down  parking camera system.",

    "full_description": "Toyota adds an XLE Touring Sport model to the Avalon's 2015 lineup, while also upgrading the Entune infotainment system, making paddle shifters standard on all models and adding blind spot monitoring to the Touring models. With its combination of style, comfort, overall quality and willing performance, the 2015 Toyota Avalon is a very smart choice for the full-size sedan buyer.Notably, we picked the 2015 Toyota Avalon as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars, Trucks and SUVs. The Toyota Avalon has a history of being a rather conservative  car. No, we don't mean it's been a frequent guest on Rush Limbaugh's radio show.  Rather, Toyota has stayed away from style  and fashion fads in favor of no-nonsense design and comfort. However, with its  2013 redesign, the latest-generation Avalon received a more stylish exterior  design and sportier handling to go with its traditional room and comfort. It  was certainly a risk for Toyota, but we like how the changes gave the Avalon a  more modern feel and yet still kept it very pleasant to drive.\nTwo years later, the 2015 Toyota Avalon keeps that  balance going. It has a quiet and comfortable interior, with plenty of room for  five passengers. It's also pretty well equipped. Even a base Avalon comes with keyless  ignition and entry, leather upholstery and a power driver seat as standard. Moving  up to the more expensive versions will get you tech-oriented features like  adaptive cruise control and smartphone app integration through Toyota's latest  version of its Entune system. For power, the Avalon relies on its 268-horsepower  3.5-liter V6 engine that delivers silky, effortless acceleration while still  returning strong fuel economy of 24 mpg combined.\nAlong with the Avalon, though, there are some great  choices in the large-sedan class this year, highlighted by the appealing 2015  Chevrolet Impala, the updated 2015 Chrysler  300 and the related, and well-rounded 2015 Hyundai Azera and 2015 Kia Cadenza.  The Avalon isn't the sportiest of this group, but it is arguably the most  comfortable and it boasts the strongest reputation for quality and reliability.  Given those strengths, the Edmunds.com \"A\"  rated Avalon easily earned a recommended spot in our 2015 Sedan Buying Guide and  certainly merits a top spot on your shopping list. The 2015 Toyota Avalon comes with a 3.5-liter V6 engine that  produces 268 hp and 248 pound-feet of torque. Power is sent to the front wheels  through a six-speed automatic transmission with manual shift capability.\nAt Edmunds.com's test track, an  Avalon XLE sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds, one of the quicker  times in this segment. EPA-estimated fuel economy stands at 24 mpg  combined (21 city/31 highway). Standard safety features for the Avalon include traction  and stability control, antilock disc brakes, front and rear seat side airbags,  side curtain airbags, front knee airbags and a rearview camera. The XLE  Touring, XLE Touring Sport and Limited come with blind spot monitoring with rear  cross-traffic alerts. Also standard on the Limited is Toyota's Safety Connect  service, which includes roadside assistance, stolen vehicle location and  automatic collision notification. The Limited's optional Technology package  includes a frontal collision warning system.\nIn our testing, an Avalon XLE came to a stop from 60 mph  in 127 feet, a few feet longer than the class average.\nIn government crash tests, the Avalon received five  out of five stars for overall crash protection, with four stars for  frontal-impact protection and five stars for side-impact protection. In testing  by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Avalon scored a \"Good\"  rating -- the highest possible -- in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset,  side-impact and roof-strength crash tests. The Avalon's seat and head restraint  design was also rated \"Good\" for whiplash protection in rear impacts. The 2015 Toyota Avalon's V6 engine is smooth and powerful  and should provide more than enough acceleration to please most drivers.  Furthermore, that performance is delivered in a very quiet, unruffled manner,  which adds to the Toyota's appeal as an effortless open highway cruiser.\nOverall, the Avalon provides an impressive blend of comfort,  performance and efficiency. It's also just plain easy to drive. The ride quality  is firmer than that of Avalons of old, though, so if you're coming out of an  older Avalon, make sure you give this new car a thorough test-drive. The Avalon's interior is spacious and elegant, with  high-quality materials throughout. The front seats are very comfortable, with  plenty of side bolstering and lumbar support for both the driver and the front  passenger. As you'd expect from a car in this class, the Avalon's rear seat is  quite roomy.\nAll Avalons come standard with Toyota's Entune infotainment system, and the XLE  Premium and above come standard with additional smartphone app integration and  a larger screen. Toyota has also updated Entune for 2015, adding swipe  capability, a customizable home screen, voice recognition training and cache  radio that can rewind up to 20 minutes.\nStorage cubbies provide ample room for drinks and  personal effects, and the center console is large. The front section of the  center console acts as a convenient \"eBin,\" with power cords passing  through a sliding panel for two cell phones and auxiliary and USB connections. This  area is also home to the available Qi wireless charging system. Toyota is among  the first automakers to offer wireless charging for cell phones. We like its  convenience, but it doesn't charge very quickly. The generous trunk offers 16  cubic feet of space, and its wide opening and low liftover height make it easy  to load heavy bags. \nThe XLE comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels,  automatic headlights, heated mirrors, dual-zone automatic climate control, full  power accessories, cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel,  leather upholstery, an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar support),  a four-way power front passenger seat and heated front seats. Electronic  features include keyless ignition and entry, a rearview camera, Bluetooth phone  and audio connectivity, a 6.1-inch central touchscreen display (Entune Audio  Plus) and an eight-speaker audio system with a CD player, satellite radio, HD  radio, an auxiliary audio jack and a USB/iPod interface.\nThe XLE Premium adds upgraded keyless ignition and entry  (additional functionality for rear doors and trunk), a power sunroof and an  auto-dimming rearview mirror.\nThe XLE Touring has 18-inch wheels, foglights, driver memory  settings, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and Toyota's Entune Premium  Audio with Navigation and App Suite, which includes a nine-speaker audio system,  a 7-inch touchscreen display, a navigation system and smartphone app  integration.\nTo the XLE Touring, the XLE Touring Sport adds  black-painted alloy wheels, xenon headlights and perforated leather upholstery  with dark blue piping.\nGoing with the Avalon Limited gets you all of the XLE  Touring's equipment plus xenon headlights, auto-dimming side mirrors, automatic  wipers, ambient cabin lighting, tri-zone automatic climate control, upgraded  leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, a 10-way power adjustable driver  seat, eight-way power adjustable front passenger seat, heated rear seats, a  rear power sunshade and an 11-speaker JBL premium sound system.\nSome of the upper trims' features are available as  options for the lower trims, though availability can vary by region in the  United States. The Limited also offers a Technology package, which includes  adaptive cruise control, frontal collision warning, automatic high-beam  headlight control, Qi wireless  charging and a pre-collision system.",

    "full_description": "For 2012, the third-row seat and rear climate control are now standard on all Highlander Hybrid models. Combining seven-passenger seating with excellent fuel economy and performance, the 2012 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a very appealing alternative to conventional crossovers. The 2012 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is an answer to a  vexing conundrum facing environmentally conscious car shoppers these days. How  can one reconcile the need for a vehicle with room for a crowd and all their  gear while at the same time satisfying a desire to drive the greenest set of  wheels to be found?\nAs the most fuel-efficient seven-passenger vehicle on  the market, the midsize Highlander Hybrid fills a unique niche. Its  gasoline-electric hybrid powertrain turns in EPA mileage estimates that are  roughly 50 percent better than comparable non-hybrid crossovers and 25 percent  better than the only other seven-passenger hybrids on the market. And if you do  most of your driving in traffic, the Highlander Hybrid's EPA estimate of 28 mpg  city should get your attention.\nJust as important, the Highlander Hybrid's powertrain  puts out a combined 280 horsepower, which gives it remarkably good acceleration  and decent towing capacity, two things hybrids typically lack. Other strengths  include a smooth ride, a comfortable interior and styling details like a distinctive  grille and blue-tinted light surrounds that help set it apart from the conventional  Highlander.\nAs good as the 2012 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is, it  does have a couple of weaknesses. First, the standard 50/50-split-folding  third-row seat is really only suitable for young kids. The real potential  deal-breaker here, however, is a price tag that's about $7,000 more than a  comparable conventional Highlander, a difference that would take a long time to  make up through the money you'll save at the gas pumps.\nAs far as alternatives are concerned, the only other  hybrid SUVs on the market include the smaller five-passenger Ford Escape (an aging design  that's about to be redesigned for 2013) and the pricier Lexus RX 450h hybrid.  To get a seven-passenger hybrid, you'd have to step up to GM's more expensive  and less efficient Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid/GMC Yukon  Hybrid twins.\nOverall, the Highlander Hybrid's many strengths and  its lack of viable competitors make it an obvious (and best) choice for  eco-savvy buyers who still need the passenger and cargo capacity of a utility  vehicle. Powering the 2012 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a hybrid  powertrain consisting of a 3.5-liter V6 gasoline engine and a trio of electric  motors. It all adds up to a healthy 280 hp, which is transferred to the  pavement via a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) and a  standard all-wheel-drive system that uses a separate electric motor to power  the rear wheels when there's a need for extra traction or acceleration.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, the updated Highlander  Hybrid went from zero to 60 mph in 7.4 seconds, which is pretty quick even by  conventional crossover standards. Properly equipped, the Highlander Hybrid can  also tow trailers up to 3,500 pounds.\nThis muscle is even more impressive considering this  powertrain's EPA fuel economy estimates, which stand at 28 mpg city/28 mpg  highway and 28 mpg in combined driving. The 2012 Toyota Highlander Hybrid comes standard with  antilock disc brakes, traction and stability control, front side airbags, side curtain  airbags that cover all three rows, a driver-side knee airbag and active front  head restraints. Also standard is a hill-start assist feature that keeps the  vehicle from rolling backward when starting off on a steep incline. In Edmunds  brake testing, the Highlander Hybrid came to a stop from 60 mph in a tidy 120  feet.\nIn government crash tests, the Highlander Hybrid  earned an overall rating of four stars (out of a possible five), along with  four stars for overall frontal protection and five stars for overall side protection.  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the conventional Highlander the  top rating of \"Good\" in both frontal-offset and side-impact crash  tests. Unlike some other environmentally friendly models, the  2012 Toyota Highlander Hybrid has enough oomph under the hood to deliver  satisfying acceleration. The hybrid system switches from the electric motor to  the gasoline V6 and back almost imperceptibly and an \"EV\" mode,  accessed by a dash-mounted switch, allows you (albeit rarely) to drive the  vehicle on electric power alone for short distances at slow speeds. An \"Econ\"  button modifies throttle response to further boost fuel economy.\nAs far as handling goes, the Highlander Hybrid feels  confident if not very inspiring. You will likely feel in more control of large  crossover rivals, as the Toyota's steering has a disconnected feel. The brakes  also have an odd feel due to their regenerative braking system. On the upside,  the Highlander Hybrid offers a smoother ride and more maneuverability than the  full-size Chevy Tahoe Hybrid. You may buy the 2012 Toyota Highlander Hybrid for its  environmentally friendly propulsion system, but it's the comfortable passenger  cabin you're likely to appreciate the most. Aside from good quality materials  and an attractive design, the interior features nice touches like the  40/20/40-split second-row seats that slide up and back for better legroom and  recline for greater comfort. The center section can also be replaced with a  convenient table or removed altogether for easier access to the standard third row.\nKids will fit in the third row, but adults probably  won't, and if you intend to haul a full allotment of passengers on a frequent  basis, then everyone will be happier in a minivan or a larger crossover like  the Chevy Traverse or Ford Flex. Overall cargo space is also less than in those  models (as well as the Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid), but you still get seats that  disappear into a flat load floor and a still impressive 94 cubic feet of maximum  cargo room. \nThe base model's list of standard equipment includes  17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, foglamps, rear privacy glass,  keyless entry, cruise control, air-conditioning (with rear controls), an  eight-way power driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering column, a sliding  and reclining 40/20/40-split second-row seat with a removable center section, a  50/50-split-folding third-row seat, a trip computer, a rearview camera, Bluetooth  phone and audio connectivity, and a six-speaker sound system with CD player,  satellite radio and an iPod/USB audio interface.\nOptions for the Highlander Hybrid base model include  19-inch alloy wheels and a power liftgate. The Leather package includes leather  upholstery (vinyl third row), heated front seats, a sunroof, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror and an upgraded trip computer. The Cold Weather package adds a  windshield wiper de-icer and heated mirrors.\nAll of the above options are included on the Limited  trim along with 19-inch wheels, additional chrome exterior trim, keyless  ignition/entry, tri-zone climate control, 10-way power driver seat and a  four-way power passenger seat. Both trims can be equipped with a nine-speaker  JBL sound system (includes a six-CD changer), a navigation system (includes a  touchscreen interface, real-time traffic and the JBL sound system) and a rear  seat entertainment system.",

    "full_description": "All 2007 Toyota Sequoias come standard with front-seat side airbags and side curtain airbags that cover the first two rows. Sequoia SR5 models get a body-color grille insert this year, while Limited models are equipped with chrome mirrors. Now in its seventh year, the 2007 Toyota Sequoia is a bit dated, but it's still a capable and comfortable full-size SUV. The largest SUV in the Toyota lineup, the full-size Sequoia is designed to accommodate families who need three rows of seating, a moderate level of off-road talent for accessing campsites and the ability to tow a boat or horse trailer. In reality, only a small percentage of Toyota Sequoia owners use their vehicles for such outdoorsy pursuits, but with its manageable dimensions, refined road manners and comfortable interior, this large SUV has always been a satisfying minivan substitute.Representing the seventh year of the model cycle, the 2007 Toyota Sequoia is still a reasonable choice for buyers who want a big, comfy SUV and don't mind spending more on fuel. Just bear in mind that a larger, more powerful Sequoia will arrive for '08.Built on the previous-generation Tundra full-size pickup platform, the Toyota Sequoia is roughly the same size as domestic sport-utes like the Chevrolet Tahoe and Ford Expedition, as well as its chief import-brand rival, the Nissan Armada. It rides on a slightly narrower track, though, which results in a bit less hip- and shoulder room in the cabin. Still, there's ample room in all three rows to make the Sequoia useful as a carpool vehicle. The 50/50-split third-row seats do not fold into the floor as in the Ford and Nissan, which can be a hassle when you need to reconfigure the vehicle for hauling cargo.Toyota claims that the Sequoia offers the most cargo capacity (128 cubic feet) among these competitors, but the company fudged this number a little by taking the measurement with the second-row seats unbolted from the floor (an operation that requires hand tools and elbow grease). That doesn't change the fact that the Sequoia is a roomy and practical SUV, and although it's beginning to look dowdy on the inside, it still boasts the best build and materials quality in the large SUV class.If you're shopping for a full-size sport-utility vehicle this year, the 2007 Toyota Sequoia is worth checking out. Its rivals offer significantly higher towing capacities, though, so if this is a priority, one of them will probably suit you better. In addition, the Armada and Expedition are apt to be better choices for buyers who use the third-row seat on an everyday basis, while the Tahoe has a more stylish design inside and out. Under the hood of every 2007 Toyota Sequoia is a 4.7-liter V8 rated for 273 horsepower and 314 pound-feet of torque. This engine lives up to Toyota's tradition of smooth power plants that deliver seamless power with minimal apparent effort. A five-speed automatic transmission is standard, and four-wheel-drive Sequoias have a low-range transfer case. Properly equipped, the Toyota Sequoia has a maximum towing capacity of 6,500 pounds (6,200 on 4x4 models) -- less than any of its competitors. Fuel economy rates 15 mpg in the city and 17-18 mpg on the highway. The Sequoia comes standard with antilock disc brakes with brake assist; stability and traction control; front-seat side airbags; and side curtain airbags for first- and second-row occupants. Toyota's largest SUV received five out of five stars for driver and front-passenger protection in government frontal-impact testing. Whether on city streets or dirt trails, the Sequoia handles well for a full-size SUV, providing both a smooth ride and easy maneuverability around turns. Those hoping for explosive V8 power will be disappointed, but the 2007 Toyota Sequoia offers fully adequate acceleration and an overall refined demeanor that family-oriented buyers will find appealing. The cabin design in the Toyota Sequoia is a bit dowdy, but ergonomics are generally good and most materials are high in quality. The standard seating configuration accommodates eight, though opting for the Limited model's luxury package drops capacity to seven by placing captain's chairs in the second row. Either way, second-row passengers are given plenty of room, and the standard 60/40-split bench seat can be reclined, folded or tumbled completely forward. As in most large SUVs, putting three kids three across in the third row is too close for comfort. Tethers on the Sequoia's 50/50-split third-row seats allow you to stow the folded halves in an upright position, but when maximum space is needed, you'll have to muscle them into the garage. Toyota lists maximum cargo capacity at 128.1 cubic feet, but that's with the second-row seats unbolted from the floor. The liftgate has a power-down rear window, which is convenient for hauling longer items. On both trucks, you can also order extras like an in-dash six-disc CD changer, a navigation system, a rear-seat DVD-based entertainment system and a rear load-leveling suspension. Limited buyers can get a luxury package with second-row bucket seats, electroluminescent gauges, faux wood trim and seat memory.",

    "full_description": "Built  on a reputation for reliability and value, the Toyota Corolla is the  best-selling vehicle of all time. As impressive as that statement is, we've  knocked previous Corolla generations for their lack of inspiration when it came  to styling, performance and refinement. With the introduction of the all-new  Corolla, those old conventions no longer ring true. On top of all of the  improvements, there's also a new hybrid model for even greater appeal. \nThe  2020 Toyota Corolla Hybrid takes the sharp, new redesign of the conventional  Corolla and adds the highly efficient powertrain from the Prius. The result is  an attractive compact sedan with phenomenal mileage. That combination has been  rather elusive until just recently, with Honda's introduction of the Insight  and the Accord Hybrid.\nLike  the Honda rivals, the Corolla Hybrid gains favor with a long list of standard  advanced safety features and an interior that exceeds expectations for quality.  Holding it back, however, is a singular (and notably modest) trim level, slower  acceleration, grabby brakes, lack of Android Auto integration, and limited rear  headroom.\nEven  with these drawbacks in mind, the 2020 Toyota Corolla Hybrid makes a compelling  case for itself among the Honda rivals. It's a huge step in the right  direction, adding even more justification for its best-seller status.\nNotably, the 2020 Toyota Corolla Hybrid is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article. The 2020 Toyota Corolla Hybrid only comes in the LE trim, and there are no options to add. Your only decisions boil down to the seven exterior colors and two interior upholstery choices. How does the Corolla Hybrid drive? The Corolla Hybrid provides respectable power and smoothness during low-speed acceleration. You won't have any trouble keeping pace with city traffic. Acceleration is somewhat lacking once you're trying to get to freeway speeds quickly (0-60 mph took a slow 10 seconds in our testing), but that's typical for fuel-sipping cars like this.\n\n   Around turns, the Corolla Hybrid is stable, though the economy-biased tires don't offer up much grip. The main drawback is an abrupt and grabby brake pedal feel at low speeds. It's more of an annoyance than anything else, but it makes the hybrid hard to stop smoothly. How comfortable is the Corolla Hybrid? The soft-cloth seats feel cushy initially, but they lack the support \u2014 not to mention lumbar adjustment \u2014 that makes longer drives tolerable.\n\n   The Corolla Hybrid's ride quality is well-controlled. It's smooth without being overly isolating or floaty. Less appealing are the front seats. They feel cushy when you first sit on them, but they lack the support and adjustability to make long drives tolerable. As for noise, the hybrid is generally quiet, though the engine can sound unpleasant when you get hard on the gas. \n\n   Owing to the hybrid's fuel-conscious intentions, the climate control system offers an Eco setting that improves efficiency. You can use this setting for temperate days, but you'll want to switch it off if you are dealing with truly hot or cold days. Otherwise, the system just can't keep up. How\u2019s the interior? The Corolla's interior isn't fancy but is thoughtfully designed. The main controls are clearly labeled and easy to find without taking your eyes off the road. We also like the driving position. Sight lines are clear to the instruments as well as to the front, rear and sides. \n\n   While the front seats have plenty of space, the rear is more restricted, especially with regard to headroom. Taller adult occupants will have to duck while getting in and out, and they'll find their heads close to the roof when seated. How\u2019s the tech? The main infotainment display is adequate but lacks navigation and arbitrarily locks out certain features when you're moving, which is a source of constant frustration. Apple CarPlay is supported and works as expected, but Android Auto is missing. Toyota's Entune app is a poor substitute when it comes to features and functionality. The integrated voice controls are effective in understanding most commands, though you still need to navigate through prompts to accomplish tasks. You're better off with your phone. \n\n   Standard safety features, such as adaptive cruise control, are impressive for the price. Alas, this system isn't smooth at low speeds, so you won't want to use it in stop-and-go traffic. How\u2019s the storage? Storage options are average overall, and you can find more accommodating cars for the money. The rear seats fold easily but not flat. Instead, they create a shelf of sorts that partitions the trunk from the cabin. This feature could be helpful for securing items that fit, but it could be annoying if you want a flat loading surface. The center console compartments can handle a phone and wallet or small purse but not much else.\n\n   Fitting car seats in the rear is easy thanks to visible and easily accessible lower car seat anchors underneath plastic flaps. The upper tethers are easy to find too. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA rates the Corolla Hybrid at a combined 52 mpg, which matches the fuel economy of the main versions of the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight. During our 117-mile evaluation route, which covers highway, country roads and city streets, our test car returned 58 mpg. Is the Corolla Hybrid a good value? The Corolla Hybrid delivers a lot of value because of its low pricing and respectable number of standard features. Most of the interior looks and feels appropriate for the price, but the overall design appears a bit higher-class. On top of that, you get two years of free maintenance and roadside assistance without a mileage restriction. \n\n   If you're content with the base car's offerings, you'll be happy. But there are no additional trim levels or options, so those seeking quality-of-life upgrades \u2014 such as premium sound, leather or superior phone connectivity \u2014 will need to look elsewhere because the Corolla Hybrid is only offered in the LE grade. Handsome exterior styling helps the new Corolla break away from the boring look and feel of previous versions. Still, you can't help but feel like you're driving an appliance. But it does nothing particularly wrong when it comes to driving fun. Instead, the Corolla Hybrid dutifully tackles the daily grind without complaint. \n\n   Alas, the characteristic hybrid drone of the engine at high speeds, the light steering feel, and the ho-hum acceleration ensure there's simply nothing to enjoy about the experience of driving.",

    "full_description": "There are no significant changes for the 2009 Toyota Prius. No car boasts a better blend of fuel and space-efficiency than the 2009 Toyota Prius. It's hard for car people with 93 octane running through their veins to realize this sometimes, but not everyone loves to drive. Not everyone gets a kick out of taking a turn quickly, or shooting away from a traffic light four times faster than the guy next to you. No, \"most people\" think of their cars as personal transportation devices on a slightly higher plane than their Frigidaires. It doesn't really matter what the steering feel is like, as long as the car offers lots of space, an easy-to-drive demeanor, worry-free reliability, a place to plug in your iPod and excellent fuel economy. For \"most people,\" the 2009 Toyota Prius is possibly the ideal car.First and foremost, this quintessential hybrid is the most fuel-efficient mass-production car currently on sale. While you pay a premium for all that hybrid sophistication, you're rewarded with considerably more refinement than a typical fuel-efficient subcompact (like a Honda Fit) has to offer, and there is something to be said for rewarding Toyota's technical innovation rather than Exxon-Mobil's ability to refine crude oil.Beyond its fuel-sipping ways, the Prius features loads of available high-tech luxury goodies, which should appeal to those who are trading out of a pricier luxury car, as well as those cross-shopping the Prius against midsize sedans like the Accord and Camry. Moreover, the Prius stands out against such sedans by offering a funky but uniquely space-efficient body design. Believe it or not, there's more backseat legroom than a Ford Crown Victoria, with ample hatchback cargo capacity to boot. It may not look big from the outside, but climb inside and you'll find the Prius surprisingly large and utilitarian. It is a tad narrow, though, and taller drivers will find the driving position off-puttingly awkward.There are other standout hybrid vehicles available for 2009, each offering similar gasoline-electric systems while providing a little something different. The Toyota Camry Hybrid offers a more luxurious and conventional driving experience. The Nissan Altima Hybrid is the fun choice for those who think of cars as something other than just an appliance. The Ford Escape Hybrid is the choice for those looking for an elevated driving position, all-wheel-drive and added utility. Finally, the Honda Civic Hybrid is an economical choice priced similarly to (but smaller than) the Prius.Nonetheless, no car combines fuel- and space-efficiency quite like the 2009 Toyota Prius. In the end, we think this is the hybrid that will best meet the needs of \"most people.\" Underneath the Prius' hood resides Toyota's \"Hybrid Synergy Drive.\" This drivetrain consists of a 1.5-liter gasoline four-cylinder engine and two electric motors -- one driving the front wheels, the other functioning solely as a generator to recharge the car's battery pack. Power is routed through a specialized continuously variable automatic transmission. The gas engine produces 76 horsepower and 82 pound-feet of torque. With the electric motor, net peak hp is 110, which is deceiving since the two power sources hit their peaks at different times. Regardless, power delivery is smooth and consistent from rest all the way to top speed. In performance testing, we clocked the Prius from zero to 60 mph in 10.4 seconds. The EPA estimates the Prius will achieve 48 mpg city/45 mpg highway and 46 mpg combined. Every 2009 Toyota Prius comes standard with antilock brakes with brake assist, traction control, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags. Stability control is available on all but the standard trim level. In government crash tests, Toyota's hybrid car earned four stars out of five for driver and front-passenger protection in frontal impacts. In side-impact testing, it earned five stars for front-occupant protection and four stars for the rear. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the Prius the top rating of \"Good\" for its protection in frontal-offset and side-impact crashes. Driving a Prius is, well, different. There is no audible engine start-up when you press the ignition button, just an instrument panel light that says \"Ready.\" The transmission selector is a stubby knob protruding from the dash. Thanks to its Hybrid Synergy Drive, the 2009 Toyota Prius can accelerate up to about 25 mph using only electric power, kind of like a huge golf cart. It's all rather strange for those accustomed to conventional vehicles, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.Aside from its idiosyncrasies, the Prius features minimal cabin noise and a suspension that provides an acceptably smooth ride despite the car's weight-saving chassis components. The Prius makes a fine highway companion, but it is particularly well-suited to the city, where its light electric steering, tight turning circle, excellent visibility and available rearview camera make it easy to park and maneuver through traffic. Also, this hybrid returns its best gas mileage in stop-and-go driving, as it's able to spend more time in full-electric mode. The overall look of the 2009 Prius is upscale, if not a little oddball. The dash is flat and wide, with a large touchscreen, digital gauges, stubby electronic shifter and plenty of steering-wheel buttons. Climbing inside, you tend to feel as if you're about to take a trip in Epcot's \"Car of the Future.\" Fit and finish is very tight and materials are pretty good, although some plastics are a little cheap. We've complained before about centrally located instrument clusters, but the Prius' electronic gauges are at least crystal-clear, mounted high and located close to the driver's line of sight, almost like a head-up display.Although the Prius offers a spacious cabin and comfy seats, the driving position is poor for taller drivers, as the driver seat is not height-adjustable and the steering wheel does not telescope. This is an area that will hopefully be addressed in the next-generation Prius. The backseat, on the other hand, offers plenty of room for adults and rear-facing infant seats. The 14.4-cubic-foot hatchback trunk is also quite large and can accommodate several roller suitcases, golf clubs or a double stroller. Plus, the folding seatbacks provide an uninterrupted cargo area that no sedan can match. The Prius options list (available on base and Touring trims) is extensive, capable of transforming this hybrid from humble economy car to near luxury status. Buyers can pick from one of the following packages. Package 2 adds stability control, a rearview camera, keyless ignition/entry and an auxiliary audio jack. Package 3 includes those items plus an alarm system, Bluetooth and an upgraded nine-speaker JBL stereo. Package 4 (available on the base only) adds xenon headlights and foglights. Package 5 includes the previously listed equipment and adds a voice-activated navigation system. Package 6 is like Package 5 but includes leather-trimmed seats and steering wheel. A choice of satellite radio providers is a stand-alone, dealer-installed option.",

    "full_description": "For 2014, the Toyota Avalon sees no changes other than a minor shuffling of standard and optional features.  With its combination of style, comfort, overall quality and high fuel economy, the 2014 Toyota Avalon is a smart choice for a full-size sedan.Notably, we picked the 2014 Toyota Avalon as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars, Trucks and SUVs. For last year's complete redesign of the Avalon, Toyota maintained the qualities the Avalon  has long been known for: a high level of comfort, plenty of room and a  reputation for quality. At the same time, the automaker significantly improved the  car's handling qualities, added higher-quality cabin materials and wrapped it  all up in a truly stylish body. The result is a more complete and desirable car.  Indeed, the 2014 Toyota Avalon is closer to being an entry-level luxury car  than a mainstream full-size sedan.\nClassifications aside, we're pretty sure you'll like the Toyota  Avalon. Whether you're just commuting by yourself to work or taking a group of  friends to lunch, the Avalon will impress with its low levels of noise and roomy  front and rear seating. You'll likely be fond of the car's coddling features  such as supportive seats, large armrests and optional premium features like adaptive  cruise control and heated and ventilated seats. Effortless performance is  furnished by Toyota's impressively smooth 3.5-liter V6 engine, which cranks out  a respectable 268 horsepower while still earning a 25 mpg combined EPA fuel  economy rating.\nPicking an affordable, large sedan for 2014 isn't easy, considering  the vastly improved 2014 Chevrolet Impala  as well as the 2014 Chrysler 300.  The 2014 Hyundai Azera and Kia Cadenza also deserve  a good, long look. All of these are smart choices, and in some cases they're  less expensive as well. But we have no problem saying the Avalon has more than  enough merits to warrant a place in your garage.  The 2014 Toyota Avalon comes with a 3.5-liter V6 engine that  generates 268 hp and 248 pound-feet of torque. Power is sent to the front  wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission.\nAt Edmunds.com's test track, an Avalon XLE sprinted to 60  mph in 6.4 seconds, one of the quicker times for this segment. EPA estimated  fuel economy stands at 25 mpg  combined (21 mpg city/31 mpg highway) for the XLE and XLE Premium. The  Touring and Limited have a slightly lower 24 mpg  combined estimate. Standard safety features for the Avalon include traction and  stability control, antilock disc brakes, front- and rear-seat side airbags,  side curtain airbags, front knee airbags and a rearview camera. The Limited comes  with blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alerts (optional on the  Touring). Also standard on the Limited is Toyota's Safety Connect service,  which includes roadside assistance, stolen vehicle location and automatic collision  notification. The Limited's optional Technology package includes a frontal  collision warning system.\nAt  the track, an Avalon XLE came to a stop from 60 mph in 127 feet, a few feet longer  than the class average. \nIn government crash tests, the Avalon received a rating  of five stars out of five for overall crash protection, with four stars for  frontal-impact protection and five stars for side-impact protection. In testing  by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Avalon scored a rating  of \"Good\" -- the highest possible -- in the moderate-overlap  frontal-offset, side-impact and roof-strength crash tests. The  Avalon's seat/head restraint design was also rated \"Good\" for  whiplash protection in rear impacts. Your first thought when driving the 2014 Toyota Avalon might  be one of mild surprise, as the big sedan feels more responsive and sure-footed  than you'd expect. The steering feels reassuringly taut, while the brakes are  nicely tuned to match the increased responsiveness of the drivetrain. Overall,  the Avalon is just easy to drive. One thing to note, however, is that the  latest car rides more firmly than Avalons of old. If you're expecting  traditional Avalon softness, make sure you give this new car a thorough test-drive.\nThe V6 engine is smooth and powerful and should provide more  than enough acceleration to please most drivers. Furthermore, that performance  is delivered in a very quiet, unruffled manner, which adds to the Toyota's appeal  as an effortless open highway cruiser. Overall, the Avalon provides an  impressive blend of comfort, performance and efficiency. The Avalon's interior is spacious and elegant, with high-quality  materials throughout. The front seats are very  comfortable and highly adjustable, with plenty of side bolstering and lumbar  support for both the driver and the front passenger. As you'd expect for this  class of car, the Avalon's rear seats are quite roomy.\nThe Avalon Touring and Limited come standard with Entune, a  suite of smartphone-connected services that includes features like the Bing search engine, Pandora streaming radio, real-time traffic  and sports and stock information. Getting  started with Entune is a hassle, since you have to install an app on your phone  and register for an account; plus, you always need an active data connection to  use it. In addition, the car has to be parked to access many of the apps (many of  which you probably already have installed on your smartphone). Finally, the  touchscreen interface has straightforward menus, but it's sometimes  unresponsive to user touch.\nStorage compartments provide ample room for drinks and  personal effects. The lower section of the center console provides a convenient  \"eBin\" with power cords passing through a sliding panel for two cell  phones and auxiliary and USB connections. A large center armrest provides more  storage space and additional connectivity and charging for cell phones. The  generous trunk offers 16 cubic feet of space, and its wide opening and low  liftover height make it easy to load heavy bags. \nThe XLE comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic  headlights, heated mirrors, dual-zone automatic climate control, full power  accessories, cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, leather  upholstery, an eight-way power driver seat with power lumbar support, a  four-way power front passenger seat and heated front seats.

    "full_description": "The 2012 Toyota Corolla receives minor feature revisions, including standard power accessories for the base model and a new sound system for the higher trim levels. Among newer (and better) rivals, the 2012 Toyota Corolla is no longer a class leader. In the absence of any significant improvements, we suggest checking out the competition first. The Toyota Corolla is synonymous with affordability and  dependability. Produced for more than four decades and with 33 million sold, it  ranks as the best-selling car of all time. But is this enough to get you to buy  a 2012 Toyota Corolla? With ever-increasing pressure from newer rivals, the  current Corolla might have been caught resting on its laurels.\nIn the three years since the current-generation Corolla  debuted, other automakers such as Chevrolet, Ford and Hyundai have dramatically  stepped up their game. As a result, the 2012 Corolla feels comparably outdated  and outclassed. From the outside, the Toyota lacks personality and excitement,  while inside the hard plastics and dull design give it a definite economy car  vibe.\nEven in the areas where the Corolla once ruled supreme --  affordability and dependability -- it has been surpassed. While many of its  newer rivals are boasting 40 mpg highway fuel economy estimates, the Corolla  rates 34 mpg. In terms of dependability, the Toyota is still rock-solid  reliable, but other cars have improved to challenge it while also offering  longer warranties to reinforce that point.\nAt the end of the day, we think you can do a lot better than  the 2012 Toyota Corolla, and suggest that potential buyers check out the  front-running competition first. We rank the Ford  Focus and Hyundai Elantra highly for their sharp  designs, welcoming cabins and high fuel economy. Meanwhile, the Chevrolet Cruze, Honda Civic and Mazda 3  are also excellent choices that surpass the Corolla in just about every regard. All 2012 Toyota Corollas are powered by a 1.8-liter inline-4  that produces 132 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed manual  is standard and a four-speed automatic is optional.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, an automatic-equipped  Corolla went from zero to 60 mph in 10.1 seconds, which is a second slower than  the class average. EPA-estimated fuel economy stands at 26 mpg city/34 mpg  highway and 29 mpg combined with the automatic and 27/34/30 with the manual.  These numbers are respectable but pale in comparison to newer competitors that  are capable of attaining 40 mpg highway. Standard safety features on all 2012 Toyota Corolla models  include stability and traction control, antilock brakes (front disc, rear  drum), front side airbags and side curtain airbags. In Edmunds brake testing,  the Corolla came to a stop from 60 mph in 127 feet, which is a bit longer than  average.\nIn government crash tests, the Corolla received an overall  score of four stars (out of a possible five), with four stars for overall  frontal-impact safety and five stars for overall side-impact safety. In  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash testing, the Corolla earned a top  \"Good\" rating in the frontal-offset, side and roof strength tests. The 2012 Toyota Corolla's softly sprung ride is perfect for  commuting, and wind and road noise are nicely quelled, even at highway speeds.  However, handling is unimpressive -- even if you don't profess to be a driving  enthusiast, a back-to-back drive between a Corolla and any number of its  competitors will reveal that the Toyota feels less responsive to inputs and  therefore makes you feel less involved with the driving experience.\nThe Corolla's lone engine choice delivers the sort of  languid acceleration typical at this price point, but Toyota makes a smooth engine, so at least  your ears won't be paying for it. However, given that the car's fuel economy  isn't as impressive as it once was, you may be less willing to put up with such  lackluster performance. The 2012 Corolla's cabin is a bit dull to the eye, and the  materials used to construct it are mediocre at best. The cabins of the  Chevrolet Cruze and Ford Focus feel like they belong to a more sophisticated  market segment by comparison. On the upside, the Corolla's controls are quite  simple to use.\nAs with most Toyotas, the Corolla's seats are soft and  comfy, and will likely bring words like \"recliner\" and \"La-Z-Boy\"  to mind. The seats lack support, however, so some may find long-distance  comfort troublesome. The front seats offer a decent amount of space even for  taller drivers (a revelation for a small Toyota), while the backseat also  boasts decent room and a cushy bottom.\nWith 12.3 cubic feet of space, trunk space is average, but  the trunk boasts a usefully wide opening. \nStandard features on the base L model includes 15-inch steel  wheels, full power accessories, keyless entry, air-conditioning, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable driver seat, a  60/40-split-folding rear seat, trip computer and a four-speaker sound system  with a CD player and an auxiliary audio jack.\nThe LE adds 16-inch alloy wheels, heated mirrors, variable intermittent  wipers, cruise control, Bluetooth, steering-wheel audio controls and a six-speaker  stereo with iPod connectivity (optional on the L). The S adds foglights, a  sport-look body kit, a rear spoiler, upgraded cloth upholstery and metallic  interior trim.\nOptional on the LE and S is a sunroof that includes an  overhead console with map lamps and a sunglasses holder. Also available is a  touchscreen navigation system with voice control, satellite radio and Bluetooth  streaming audio.",

    "full_description": "For 2012, the Toyota 4Runner receives new sound system features, including Toyota's new Entune connectivity system. Automatic-deploying running boards are a new option for the SR5 and Limited trim levels. For the relatively few drivers who require an all-conquering all-terrain SUV, the 2012 Toyota 4Runner is a top choice. Like the white rhino, the Toyota 4Runner is an endangered  species. It's one of the last SUVs left with body-on-frame construction and a traditional  outdoor work ethic. If you're looking for a vehicle with true off-road  capability and all the rugged hardware that makes it possible, the 2012 Toyota  4Runner is here for you.\nBeing endangered doesn't mean the 4Runner is a relic.  Motivated by a powerful 270-horsepower V6, the two- or four-wheel-drive 4Runner  will keep up with the Joneses and their more common car-based crossover SUVs  while still getting decent fuel economy. The 4Runner's interior is also pretty  roomy for cargo and can be optioned with a third-row seat for seven-passenger  capacity. Toyota's new \"Entune\" smartphone integration system is new  for the 4Runner this year as well.\nIn terms of off-road gear, every 4Runner loads up with a specialized  traction-control system, hill-hold and hill-descent control and a full-size  spare tire. Depending on the trim, there are two types of four-wheel drive (available  with low-range gearing, locking center and/or locking rear differentials), two  suspension options (one of which can disconnect the front and rear stabilizer  bars for greater wheel articulation over rough terrain) and specialized tires.\nThe main issue you'll want to think about is that when  compared to a modern crossover such as the Chevrolet  Traverse, Honda Pilot or even Toyota Highlander is that the  truck-based 4Runner lacks the comfort, utility and general convenience found in  those suburban-duty vehicles. And compared to its closest competitor, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, the 4Runner doesn't  offer a V8 engine option and isn't as upscale on the inside. But overall, we  like the 2012 Toyota 4Runner and recommend it, even if it represents the last  of a dying breed. The 2012 Toyota 4Runner comes standard with a 4.0-liter V6  engine that produces 270 hp and 278 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed  automatic is the only available transmission. The SR5 and Limited trims' 4WD  systems differ in that the SR5 uses part-time dual-range and the Limited  utilizes a full-time system with a lockable center differential. The Trail  comes only with part-time dual-range 4WD but with a locking rear differential  and selectable electronic terrain-sensitive systems. Regardless of model or  trim, the 4Runner's towing capacity is rated at 5,000 pounds.\nIn Edmunds instrumented testing, a rear-drive 4Runner SR5  accelerated from a standstill to 60 mph in 7.2 seconds (8.2 seconds for a 4x4 Trail  model), which is about average among competing SUVs. The EPA estimates 17 mpg  city/23 mpg highway and 19 mpg combined for a rear-wheel-drive 4Runner, which  is also average in this segment. A four-wheel-drive 4Runner gets 1 mpg less on the  highway. Standard 4Runner safety features include antilock disc  brakes, stability and traction control, active front head restraints, front  knee airbags, front-seat side airbags and full-length, roll-sensing side  curtain airbags. For 2012, the Limited comes with Safety Connect, Toyota's  emergency assistance (stolen-vehicle locator, roadside assistance and automatic  collision notification) system.\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the  4Runner its top rating of \"Good\" for both frontal-offset and  side-impact protection and a second best \"Acceptable\" in the roof  strength test. In an Edmunds test, a rear-wheel-drive 4Runner SR5 came to a  stop from 60 mph in 122 feet, which is average among other SUVs in its class.  However, a Trail model with its off-road-oriented tires consumed 140 feet to  come to a standstill. Cruising around town, the 2012 Toyota 4Runner is  surprisingly smooth and comfortable. Despite being built on a truck chassis,  there is very little of the bouncy, over-sprung ride you expect from a  body-on-frame vehicle capable of serious off-roading. Though no V8 engine is  offered, the standard V6 provides plenty of grunt and should be suitable for just  about any driver.\nOn the downside, the 4Runner's on-road handling limits are  notably low and the steering feels disconnected and uncommunicative on the  pavement. Although the low-speed light effort of the steering makes for easy  maneuvering in parking lots, this attribute also makes for less kickback on a  rutted or rocky trail.\nOff-road, the 4Runner performs very well -- perhaps one of  the best -- particularly if it's a Trail model fitted with KDSS. The Toyota 4Runner's interior features a geometric,  industrial theme that supports this SUV's rugged image. Hard plastics are  abundant throughout the cabin, though most touch points are lightly padded. The  oversized climate control knobs underscore the 4Runner's utilitarian design,  but have a wobbly feel when operated. Notable for 2012 is Toyota's new Entune  smartphone integration system that allows one to utilize many popular  applications such as Pandora and OpenTable through the car's audio system and  display screen.\nFor more conventional endeavors, the Toyota 4Runner offers  spacious seating for five passengers. The 40/20/40-split second row offers  cargo-carrying flexibility and each section reclines through 16 degrees in four  steps. The optional third-row seat increases the count to seven, though it's  suitable only for small adults or children. With all seats folded flat, maximum  cargo capacity is a useful 90 cubic feet. An optional sliding rear cargo deck  can support up to 440 pounds. Tailgate partygoers will appreciate the optional  Party Mode, which directs most of the audio system's sound to the speakers in  the liftgate and increases bass response for a thumpin' good time. \nStandard features on the 4Runner SR5 include 17-inch alloy  wheels, skid plates, hill-start assist and hill-descent control, heated  mirrors, foglights, air-conditioning with rear ventilation, cruise control,  full power accessories, a power rear window, a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, a trip computer, Bluetooth (with audio streaming) and an eight-speaker sound  system with a CD player, satellite radio, an auxiliary audio jack and a USB/iPod  interface.\nThe 4Runner Trail level is only available as a 4WD model,  and it includes the above equipment plus mud guards, a locking rear  differential, Crawl Control (which electronically modulates throttle and brakes  when ascending or descending hills), off-road-oriented tires, a sunroof, water-resistant  seat fabric, power front seats, a rearview camera with a monitor integrated  into the mirror, a sliding rear cargo deck, upgraded gauges and two 120-volt  household power outlets.\nThe Limited includes 20-inch wheels, adaptive suspension  dampers, keyless ignition/entry, automatic headlights, dual-zone automatic  climate control, leather upholstery, heated front seats and power lumbar  support for the driver seat. Also standard for the Limited is an integrated rearview camera, HD radio and  Toyota's Entune smartphone integration system.\nMany of the features incorporated by the 4Runner Trail and  Limited are available as options for the SR5 model, though specifics will vary  based on the region of the U.S. in which you live. Other option highlights include a voice-activated navigation system, a 50/50-split third-row seat, automatic deploying/retracting running  boards (not available on Trail) and the KDSS off-road suspension (available  only on Trail models).",

    "full_description": "For 2013, all Highlander Hybrids get navigation and an Entune-enabled version of Toyota's Display Audio infotainment system as standard equipment, while the Leather Premium package includes more content. Combining seven-passenger seating with excellent fuel economy and performance, the 2013 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a very appealing alternative to conventional crossovers. The 2013 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a vehicle for  which you can check off several boxes. One or all might be important to you,  but the more boxes you check, the more you'll appreciate the Highlander  Hybrid's appeal.\nFirst and foremost, it's a hybrid and inherently is  much more fuel-efficient than any like-sized conventional crossover. At about  28 mpg combined, you'll be doing way better at the gas pump than just about  anybody else with a utility vehicle, even much smaller ones. And unlike the  reputation of its Prius cousin for being underpowered, the Highlander Hybrid's  standard 3.5-liter V6 means there's surprising and satisfying thrust just about  all the time.\nThe 2013 Toyota Highlander Hybrid also is a convincing  minivan substitute, particularly for those who might usually use most of those  seats but still would rather not buy a minivan. The Highlander's truncated  third row isn't really meant for adults or child safety seats, but it's fine  for quick trips and bendable adolescents. Finally, you get all of this in a  vehicle with standard all-wheel drive, checking off another box if you need a  vessel to handle nasty weather.\nToo good to be true? About the only real issue, aside  from the Highlander Hybrid's numb steering, soft-ish ride and styling that's  probably too conservative, is cost. The 2013 Highlander Hybrid's base price is  thousands more than the conventionally powered Highlander (although the hybrid  is more lavishly equipped). If you see the Highlander Hybrid merely as an  investment or hedge bet on gasoline prices, plan on owning it for a long while  after it's paid off -- even with savings at the pump.\n\n  If you're interested in a hybrid crossover that's  similarly sized, the upscale Volkswagen Touareg Hybrid is also a  great choice, but has only five seats and is even more expensive. The same is  true for the 2013 Lexus RX 450h hybrid from Toyota's premium division. An intriguing option might be the admittedly  smaller 2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid,  a five-seat hatchback wagon that offers class-leading fuel economy, plenty of  potential utility and a price that's smaller than the Highlander Hybrid's, too.\nFew if any vehicles in the market, however, allow you  to check off as many boxes as the 2013 Highlander Hybrid. The 2013 Toyota Highlander Hybrid's sophisticated and  complex powertrain comprises a 3.5-liter V6 gasoline engine and a trio of  electric motors. The gasoline engine and electric motors can operate alone or  in tandem depending on the driving conditions. Together, they produce a maximum  of 280 horsepower. To maximize efficiency in most situations, power is  transmitted only to the front wheels via a continuously variable automatic  transmission (CVT), while a separate electric motor drives the rear wheels when  there's a need for extra traction or acceleration.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, a Highlander Hybrid  went from zero to 60 mph in 7.4 seconds, a quick time even for a conventionally  powered midsize crossover. Properly equipped, the Highlander Hybrid also can  tow up to 3,500 pounds.\nDespite its satisfying performance, the Highlander  Hybrid's fuel economy is its real strength. The EPA rates the Highlander Hybrid  at 28 mpg city/28 mpg highway and 28 mpg in combined driving. The 2013 Toyota Highlander Hybrid comes standard with  antilock disc brakes, traction and stability control, front side airbags, side curtain  airbags, a driver-side knee airbag and active front head restraints. In Edmunds  brake testing, the Highlander Hybrid came to a stop from 60 mph in 120 feet, a  very good performance, particularly considering the Highlander Hybrid's  batteries and extra components make it markedly heavier than conventionally  powered vehicles.\nIn government crash tests, the Highlander Hybrid  earned an overall rating of four stars (out of a possible five), with four  stars for overall frontal protection and five stars for overall side  protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the conventional  Highlander the top rating of \"Good\" in frontal-offset, side-impact and  roof-strength crash tests. The 2013 Highlander Hybrid dispels the perception that  hybrids are great fuel sippers but lousy performers. Drop the accelerator pedal  and the gasoline V6 and electric drive motors imperceptibly team up to generate  acceleration that will leave plenty of \"regular\" crossovers in your  dust.\nToo bad, then, that the Highlander Hybrid's steering  feels so disconnected, because it magnifies the fact that this crossover's  suspension is definitely tuned for a soft ride: the trade-off being sometimes  ungainly handling if corners are taken too quickly. Still, the Highlander  Hybrid is a crossover designed to satisfy you with an unchallenging blend of  utility and economy. Just load up the gang, punch up the fuel economy display  on the Highlander Hybrid's spacious center screen and revel in the comfort in  which everyone can travel while using as little fossil fuel as possible. There's a quiet, upscale feel to the 2013 Highlander  Hybrid when you take in the wide center console, big (but not oversized) 6.1-inch  screen for the standard navigation system and the tight tolerances of the trim.  The Highlander Hybrid's interior is conventional but comfortable -- and most  important, easy to use.\nThat ease-of-use factor extends to passengers, too.  The second-row seats slide and seatbacks recline, allowing everyone to tailor a  seating position. A nice feature allows removal of the center portion of the  seat if you prefer a six-passenger layout. All the materials are nice to look  at and touch, yet feel durable enough to stand the beating a family's likely to  inflict.\nThe Highlander Hybrid does not provide quite as much  cargo capacity as a minivan or a full-size crossover, but it can haul plenty if  needed: There's 42 cubic feet of cargo room with the third-row seat neatly  folded flat. Drop both seats and there's a very useful 94 cubic feet back  there. For comparison, the like-sized VW Touareg Hybrid offers 32 cubic feet  behind its second row and a maximum of 64 cubic feet. \nThe base model's list of standard equipment includes  17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, foglamps, rear privacy glass,  keyless entry, cruise control, air-conditioning (with rear controls), an  eight-way power driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering column, a sliding  and reclining 40/20/40-split second-row seat with a removable center section, a  50/50-split-folding third-row seat, a trip computer, a rearview camera,  Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a 6-inch touchscreen display, Toyota's  Entune app integration, a navigation system and a six-speaker sound system with  CD player, satellite radio and an iPod/USB audio interface.\nThere are just two option packages for the base  Highlander Hybrid. A Leather Premium package includes leather upholstery (vinyl  third row), heated front seats, a sunroof, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and  an upgraded trip computer.\nAll of the above options are included on the Limited  trim along with 19-inch wheels, a power liftgate, keyless ignition/entry,  tri-zone climate control, a four-way power passenger seat and a nine-speaker  JBL premium sound system. A rear seat entertainment system is optional.",

    "full_description": "For 2017, the Toyota Avalon Hybrid receives the previously optional Toyota Safety Sense package as standard equipment. It includes forward collision warning, automatic pre-collision braking, and lane departure warning and intervention. Back in the early days of  gasoline-electric hybrids, cars with these innovative powertrains wowed buyers  with their ability to wring a phenomenal number of miles out of a single gallon  of gas. But you also had to give up some luxury and refinement to get it. Fast  forward to today, and you'll find that models such as the 2017 Toyota Avalon  Hybrid sacrifice very little at the altar of great fuel economy. \nA large sedan that can post higher  EPA fuel economy numbers (40 mpg combined) than the Toyota's own compact  Corolla model still qualifies as pretty noteworthy. The fact that the Avalon  Hybrid can do it with an abundance of style and comfort is nothing short of  remarkable. The handsome Avalon Hybrid looks like a more expensive European  model, inside and out. Comfort is assured by a spacious interior done up in  upscale materials and featuring the latest must-have amenities, from adaptive  cruise control to a touchscreen infotainment system. \nOf course good looks and nifty  technology aren't everything. The Avalon Hybrid has sufficient power for  everyday motoring and the same composed ride quality as its non-hybrid sibling.  The fact that it will go nearly 700 miles between fill-ups assures that you'll  spend more time driving and less time pumping.\nAll the more remarkable is that the  Avalon Hybrid is pretty much in a class of one. The closest competitors, in  fact, is the group of midsize hybrid sedans that include the Ford Fusion  Hybrid, Honda Accord Hybrid and Hyundai Sonata Hybrid. Or if it's richer luxury  trappings you seek, you may want to add the Lexus ES 300h, which is related to  the Avalon, to your test-drive list. Even among that crowd of likable  alternatives, however, we think the 2017 Toyota Avalon Hybrid is still pretty  impressive. The 2017 Toyota Avalon Hybrid's list  of standard safety features includes traction and stability control, antilock  disc brakes, front- and rear-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and front  knee airbags. All models now come with Toyota Safety Sense, which includes  adaptive cruise control, a forward pre-collision warning and mitigation system  with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with steering assistance, and  automatic\u00a0 high-beam control.\nThe XLE Premium and Limited also  come with blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. The Limited also  gets Toyota's Safety Connect service, which includes roadside assistance,  stolen vehicle location and automatic collision notification. \nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Avalon  Hybrid stopped from 60 mph in 132 feet, about 5 feet longer than average for  the segment.\nIn government crash testing, the 2017 Avalon Hybrid received five out of five stars for  overall crash protection, four stars for front-impact and five stars for  side-impact protection. In testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway  Safety, the otherwise similar non-hybrid Avalon scored a Good rating (the  highest possible) in the moderate-overlap and small-overlap front-impact tests  as well as Good score in the side-impact, roof strength and seat/head restraint  (whiplash protection) tests. On the road, the 2017 Toyota Avalon  Hybrid is an easy car to like, with its confidence-inspiring handling and  smooth ride quality. On this last point, however, it bears mentioning that this  current version does have a firmer ride than previous generations, so owners of  older models will want to note the difference when taking a test drive. \nThe gasoline-electric powertrain  delivers modest performance, mainly because its 200 hp is on the low side for a  car the Avalon Hybrid's size. It is, however, notable for its quiet operation.  Downsides are minor and include an occasional droning noise from the engine  caused by the continuously variable automatic transmission and an nonlinear  brake pedal feel that takes some time to acclimate to. The 2017 Toyota Avalon Hybrid has a  stylish, sophisticated cabin that's enhanced by the use of first-rate  materials. Front seats are comfortable and supportive and feature a wide range  of adjustability. In back the seats are as spacious as you'd expect in a large  sedan, and the Limited model's heated rear seats and power rear window sunshade  only add to the comfort level. \nThe interior also features a number  of stowage spaces including a large center console compartment and smaller bins  for wallets and other paraphernalia of daily living. A designated  \"e-bin\" in the center console features a cable pass-through for  charging cellphones via the adjacent 12-volt and USB outlets. This cubby is  also home to the Qi wireless charging system that works with compatible  cellphones.\nOut back, the Avalon Hybrid offers a  trunk with a healthy 14 cubic feet of cargo capacity, just 2 cubic feet shy of  the non-hybrid Avalon. \nThe entry-level XLE Plus comes  well-equipped with standard features that include 17-inch alloy wheels,  automatic headlights (including high beams), adaptive cruise control, heated  outside mirrors, a sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather  upholstery, an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar support) and a  four-way power front passenger seat, heated front seats, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, adaptive cruise control and a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel. Electronic features include keyless ignition and entry, Bluetooth  connectivity, a rearview camera and Toyota's Entune Audio Plus setup that  consists of a 7-inch touchscreen display, voice controls and an eight-speaker  audio system with a CD player, satellite radio, an auxiliary audio input jack  and a USB-media interface. This year's Avalon also has forward collision warning, automatic pre-collision  braking, and lane departure warning and intervention as standard. \nThe XLE Premium adds foglights,  blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, driver-seat memory settings,  Qi wireless smartphone charging and Entune Premium Audio with Navigation and  App Suite, which includes a navigation system, smartphone app integration and  nine speakers.\nThe Limited includes all the above  plus xenon headlights, automatic wipers, auto-dimming outside mirrors, tri-zone  automatic climate control, an upgraded gauge cluster, upgraded leather  upholstery, a 10-way power driver seat, an eight-way power front passenger  seat, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a rear power sunshade, ambient  lighting and an 11-speaker JBL premium sound system.  The 2017 Toyota Avalon Hybrid is  powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor  that's fed by a trunk-mounted battery pack. Combined, the two power units  produce 200 horsepower, which is sent to the front wheels by way of a  continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). In Edmunds testing, an  Avalon Hybrid accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds. This is about a  second slower than the regular, V6-powered Avalon or most other conventional  large sedans, but it's respectably quick for a hybrid sedan.\nAccording to EPA estimates, the  Avalon Hybrid returns 40 mpg in combined driving (40 city/39 highway).

    "full_description": "The Toyota Camry sees no major changes for 2009. As expected, the 2009 Toyota Camry is pleasant to drive and spacious enough to keep a family of four content on a long road trip. But newer competition has managed to better this segment titan in overall performance and cabin refinement. Constants can be strangely comforting. Knowing, for example, that your Grandma's tasty lasagna or your tennis partner's solid serve are going to be as you expect may even cause warm and fuzzy feelings. Of course, in some cases constants can wane over time -- such as the Red Sox losing or Paul McCartney producing good music.As one of the best-selling vehicles over the past 20 years, the Toyota Camry has been a comforting constant in its own right. Buyers are frequently working on their third or fourth Camry because of their prior positive experiences. The 2009 version of this Toyota stalwart continues to offer what most folks are looking for in a mainstream midsize family sedan: a roomy cabin, a comfortable ride, an easy-to-drive demeanor and a reputation for reliability and low maintenance costs. A strong resale value doesn't hurt either. However, like Sir Paul, this automotive constant has started to wane.The current generation of the Camry is the largest version of the car yet. Although categorized as a midsize car, the Camry offers plenty of passenger room front and rear. This is also the most muscular Camry ever, with an available 268-horsepower V6 at the driver's beck and call. Matched to a smooth six-speed automatic transmission, that powerhouse can propel this family sedan to 60 mph in just 6.5 seconds -- as quick as some sport sedans and coupes. It also returns fuel economy that's impressively close to that of a four-cylinder Camry.Likable as it is, the 2009 Toyota Camry has some significant caveats. One is that its historically excellent build and materials quality has slipped in the last few years, and reliability has slipped. Competitors who have trailed the Camry in the past have stepped up their game, surpassing the Toyota in many areas. One in particular is handling -- in spite of its quickness and speed, the Camry is not an athlete, placing light-effort driving over communicative steering that would lend a sense of confidence to the driver. For those who prefer greater feedback and a more involving driving experience, the Chevrolet Malibu, Honda Accord, Mazda 6 and Nissan Altima are worthy of close consideration.And then there is pricing -- the ever-popular Camry commands a premium over value-packed rivals such as the Malibu, Ford Fusion and Hyundai Sonata. Of course, there is the Camry's chief competitor, the Honda Accord, which provides a more involving drive, though not as hushed a freeway ride as the Toyota. It also beats the Camry in terms of cabin materials and build quality.With so many strong entrants in this segment, back-to-back test-drives are encouraged. Though the 2009 Toyota Camry may be as enticingly familiar as flannel pajamas on a cold winter's night, savvy consumers may find that trying on brand X yields an even more comfortable fit. All Camrys are front-drive and the standard engine on all trim levels is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder rated for 158 hp and 161 pound-feet of torque. In most states, the four-cylinder carries Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) certification. It meets the more stringent Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (PZEV) standard in California-emissions states, but has slightly lower output ratings -- 155 hp and 158 lb-ft.With the four-cylinder engine, one may choose either a five-speed manual or a five-speed automatic transmission, except on the XLE, which is automatic only. Performance is relatively spirited, as we've timed a four-cylinder with the automatic at 8.9 seconds for the 0-60-mph drill. Regardless of which transmission is selected, fuel economy ratings are 21 mpg city and 31 mpg highway.For those seeking a swifter Camry, there is the 3.5-liter V6 that pumps out 268 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed automatic is the sole transmission choice. Outfitted as such, the Camry can sprint to 60 mph in just 6.5 seconds, while fuel economy is still impressive at 19 city/28 mpg highway. Every 2009 Toyota Camry comes with antilock brakes (with brake assist), front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and a driver knee airbag. Stability control (which includes traction control) is optional across the line.In crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Camry earned a perfect five stars in all frontal- and side-impact categories. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave it the top rating of \"Good\" in its frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. Although the base four-cylinder engine should be adequate for most buyers, a more appealing choice for those who can spend more is the smooth and vigorous V6, which transforms the Camry into one of the fastest mid-priced sedans on the road, with barely any penalty in fuel efficiency.However, all that power isn't quite in keeping with the Camry's lackadaisical driving dynamics. A soft, quiet ride characterizes the Camry's on-road demeanor, and unless you opt for the more firmly sprung SE model, this Toyota asks its driver to forgo all involvement in the motoring experience. The overriding impression is one of a serene and somewhat isolated feel from the road compared to more athletic competitors. Toyota knows that the majority of buyers in this market segment are more interested in comfortable, stress-free travel than tearing through corners, and the refined and very capable 2009 Toyota Camry should prove satisfactory with them.Read our Toyota Camry Long-Term 20,000-Mile Test In base and LE models, the Camry's interior is more about function than flash. Large controls are logically placed, and the wide seats easily accommodate most body types. There are plenty of functional storage cubbies, too. One of the few exceptions to the hyper-practical design dictum is the stylish ice-blue backlighting for the audio and climate controls.The upper trims step up the style and comfort level a bit -- the XLE features simulated bird's eye maple accents that are so convincing you might find yourself breaking out the furniture polish when detailing the car. The XLE also features a luxury not typically seen in this segment -- reclining rear seats. Trunk capacity measures around 15 cubic feet.Sadly, build and materials quality aren't up to the high standard set by previous-generation Camrys. Specifically, we've noticed that some plastics are mediocre in quality and the panel fitments aren't uniformly precise. Many competitors are now better. The base Camry features 16-inch steel wheels, air-conditioning, a six-speaker CD audio system with an auxiliary input jack, a tilt and telescoping steering wheel, cruise control, full power accessories and a 60/40-split-folding rear seat. The Camry LE adds keyless entry and an eight-way power driver seat.The SE includes a sport-tuned suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels, and special interior and exterior styling details. The luxurious XLE reverts to the LE's softer suspension settings and 16-inch wheels while treating its occupants to a 440-watt JBL sound system (with an in-dash CD changer and satellite radio), Bluetooth connectivity, automatic dual-zone climate control (with a cabin air filter), reclining rear seats, a moonroof, wood-tone accents and, on the V6 model, leather seating. Note that neither the SE nor the XLE offers the folding rear seat, though each has a center pass-through.Most buyers' needs should be satisfied by the assorted trim levels. However, a few key options are available, including a navigation system, a sunroof and heated seats. A keyless ignition system is available on XLE V6 models.",

    "full_description": "The 2012 Venza now assumes traditional Toyota hierarchy with LE, XLE and Limited trim levels. Visually and mechanically, however, it is a carryover from last year. The 2012 Toyota Venza is hard to define, but whether you call it a wagon or a crossover, it's a competitive and comfortable family vehicle. Whether people are willing to admit it or not, wagons are  often more practical, space-efficient, and easier to drive than SUVs or even  some crossovers. In fact, because most crossovers are trying to disguise  themselves as light-duty SUVs, they often feature high step-in and seat heights  that are not necessarily family-friendly. The hard-to-classify 2012 Toyota  Venza has everything you like about the space in an SUV, only in a package as  easy to live with as a wagon. But forget trying to define the Venza. It avoids  the apparent arrogance of an SUV, the stigma of a minivan and the ambivalence  of a crossover; it simply works.\nAnd if there's one thing the 2012 Toyota Venza is, it's  family-friendly. The driving experience is completely non-taxing, since the  Venza is not trying to out-sport European sport wagons. While most folks will  be completely happy with the standard four-cylinder engine (unless the future  holds fully loaded trips to the mountains or towing), the V6 offers nearly the  same fuel economy and is probably the better choice for all-purpose drivability.  All-wheel drive is offered with either engine. \nThe Venza's generously proportioned interior abounds with  clever design that's meant to be useful rather than trendy. There are numerous  bins, cubbies and storage options. The 60/40 rear seats easily accommodate  rear-facing child seats and fold conveniently with the pull of a lever to  expand cargo capacity to SUV scale. In addition, a full complement of features  and conveniences are offered for modern families, either as standard or  optional equipment. Even the base model Venza comes very well equipped, and the  various option packages mostly upgrade rather than augment existing equipment  levels. Standout options include a panoramic moonroof and a voice-activated  navigation system (with traffic and an integrated reverse camera).\nIt's difficult to select a direct competitor for the 2012  Toyota Venza, but those who have considered the Honda  Crosstour and its unique  attributes (and shortcomings) or the Nissan Murano  because of its eye-catching style would do well to check out the Venza. The Subaru  Outback is another vehicle to consider if you want something a bit more  rugged-looking. Overall, we think very highly of the 2012 Toyota Venza, because  it offers just about everything you'll find in a typical crossover, only with fewer  drawbacks when it comes to everyday usability. The 2012 Toyota Venza is available with a four- or  six-cylinder engine mated to either front- or all-wheel drive. All versions  feature a six-speed automatic transmission.\nThe 2.7-liter four-cylinder produces 182 horsepower and 182  pound-feet of torque. In Edmunds performance testing, a four-cylinder,  front-drive Venza went from a standstill to 60 mph in 9.3 seconds -- an average  time compared to similarly powered crossovers. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 21  mpg city/27 mpg highway and 23 mpg combined with front-wheel drive and 20/25/22  with all-wheel drive.\nThe 3.5-liter V6 produces 268 hp and 246 lb-ft of torque. In  Edmunds performance testing, an all-wheel-drive Venza V6 accelerated from zero  to 60 mph in a quick 6.9 seconds. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 19/26/22 with  front drive and 18/25/21 with AWD. Those are impressive mileage numbers for a  vehicle of this size and power. Properly equipped, a V6 Venza can tow 3,500  pounds. Every 2012 Toyota Venza comes standard with antilock disc  brakes, stability and traction control, front-seat side airbags, side curtain  airbags, a driver knee airbag and front-seat active head restraints. In Edmunds  brake testing, the Venza came to a stop from 60 mph in a respectable 122 feet.\nThe Toyota Venza has received an overall four-star rating (out  of a possible five) in government crash testing, which is comprised of three  stars for front crash protection and five stars for side-impact protection. In  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Venza earned the highest  rating of \"Good\" performance in its frontal-offset, side and  roof-strength tests. It shouldn't come as a shock that the 2012 Toyota Venza is  hardly a wagon in the ilk of sporty European models. Instead, the Venza is  designed for comfort, utility and ease of driving. If it weren't for the vague  feel of its electric-assist steering, the Venza might actually be interesting  to drive instead of merely pleasant. Parking lot maneuvers couldn't be easier,  however. Both engines provide ample power to move this sizable vehicle,  although the V6 is obviously the way to go if passing folks on the highway  takes precedence over achieving the best fuel economy. The 2012 Venza doesn't quite exhibit the top-notch interior  quality of past Toyota models, but the overall design is rather fetching and  practical, with a sleek center console that features a high-mounted shifter  that frees up space between the seats. This allows for a large console bin,  generously sized cupholders and smaller bins perfect for iPods and other small  devices. The audio and climate controls are a design departure for Toyota, but  they remain user-friendly.\nAlthough it lacks a third-row seat, the Venza provides loads  of passenger space, particularly in the rear, which features reclining  seatbacks. A bit more driver seat adjustment would be nice, though. The cargo  area can swallow 70 cubic feet of stuff with the rear seats folded and a  healthy 34.4 cubes with the seats up. These numbers put the Venza a smidgen  ahead of the Ford Edge and Nissan Murano. \nThe 2012 Toyota Venza LE comes standard with 19-inch alloy  wheels (20 inches on V6), automatic headlamps, foglamps, privacy glass, cruise  control, dual-zone automatic climate control, an eight-way power driver seat  (includes power lumbar), a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a trip computer  display, and Bluetooth with audio streaming. The LE's sound system includes six  speakers, a CD player, satellite radio, an auxiliary audio jack and a USB/iPod  interface.\nAlong with its bigger engine, the 2012 Toyota Venza LE V6  adds 20-inch wheels. To this, the XLE grade adds an anti-theft system with  engine immobilizer, keyless ignition/entry, a power liftgate, an upgraded trip computer  display, a rearview camera, leather upholstery, heated front seats and a four-way  power passenger seat.\nThe top-of-the-line Limited augments the XLE's standard  equipment with xenon headlamps (with automatic high beams), a panoramic sunroof,  a voice-activated touchscreen navigation system and a JBL 13-speaker sound system  with a CD changer.\nThe availability of Toyota options and packages often  depends on the region, so check with your local dealer. In general, there are  four major packages that mimic equipment found in higher grades, and a V6  tow-prep package that includes an oil cooler, larger radiator fan and  heavy-duty alternator.\nThe LE Convenience package includes a power liftgate and a back-up  camera. To that, the LE Preferred package further adds the panoramic roof. The XLE  Premium package includes the above, plus the JBL audio system. The XLE Navigation  package includes the navigation system as well as the JBL audio system.",

    "full_description": "The 2016 Toyota Avalon Hybrid gets a redesigned grille and front turn signal lamps, loses the Touring trim and gets a new base XLE Plus trim. A wireless smartphone charging system is now standard for the XLE Premium and Limited trims, and the Toyota Safety Sense package is available for the Limited trim. With its upscale styling, ample standard features list, welcoming cabin and impressive fuel economy, the 2016 Toyota Avalon Hybrid is a top choice for buyers looking for a fuel-sipping, family-size sedan. Hybrids are old news by now: The technology is commonplace, and  every automaker in the market has at least one hybrid model to offer. Toyota, the industry leader in hybrid sales,  has seven models with gas-electric powertrains and has the most experience blending  electricity and internal combustion power to provide a smooth and  fuel-efficient ride. But when that system is applied to a large sedan and  results in a 66 percent boost in fuel efficiency, well, that's worth noting.\n\nThe 2016 Toyota Avalon  Hybrid is a large sedan that delivers stellar fuel efficiency.\nThat's why the 2016 Toyota Avalon Hybrid, while not a new  model, still has the power to amaze. Not only does the 2016 Avalon Hybrid  deliver 40 mpg combined, two-thirds more than the standard Avalon's 24 mpg  combined rating, it does so without compromising comfort, roominess or ride  quality.\nToyota hasn't chosen to share how it is done, but by using  the similarly sized but lighter Toyota Camry Hybrid's 200-horsepower, 3-5-liter  V6-based hybrid system, the Avalon Hybrid manages to deliver plenty of power  for everyday needs along with even better fuel efficiency than the compact  Toyota Corolla Eco. The Avalon is truly a cruising car: Its 17-gallon fuel tank  gives it a theoretical range of nearly 700 miles.\nLike the standard Avalon, the Avalon Hybrid boasts an attractive  look that might make you mistake it for a European luxury sedan. The interior  continues the upscale theme with high-quality materials, plenty of space for  passengers and numerous features. Even a base Avalon comes with keyless  ignition and entry, leather upholstery and a power driver seat as standard.  Moving up to the more expensive versions will get you tech-oriented features  like adaptive cruise control and smartphone app integration through Toyota's  latest version of its Entune system.\nThe Avalon Hybrid is in a class of its own, too. The only  other large near-luxury sedan to offer a hybrid system is the 2016  Buick LaCrosse. We like the LaCrosse in general, but its \"eAssist\"  mild hybrid system is nowhere near as efficient as the Avalon's. Beyond that,  you might check out less upscale midsize hybrids like the quicker and sportier 2016 Ford Fusion Hybrid,  the well-appointed Hyundai  Sonata Hybrid or even Toyota's own 2016 Camry Hybrid if you want to save a bit of money and get little bit more fuel efficiency. If  you prefer a luxury brand, the 2016 Lexus ES 300h offers  a similar size and features. Overall we find the Edmunds \"B\"-rated 2016 Toyota Avalon Hybrid to be one impressive package. The 2016 Toyota Avalon Hybrid is powered by a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor that's fed by a  trunk-mounted battery pack. Combined, the two power units are good for 200 hp.  A continuously variable transmission (CVT) delivers power to the front wheels.\nAccording to EPA estimates, the Avalon Hybrid returns 40 mpg in  combined driving (40 city/39 highway). In Edmunds performance testing, an  Avalon Hybrid Limited accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds. This is  about a second slower than the regular, V6-powered Avalon or most other conventional  large sedans, but quite peppy for a hybrid sedan.\n\nIts 200-horsepower  gas-electric hybrid system gives the 2016 Avalon Hybrid just enough muscle. Standard safety features include traction and stability  control, antilock disc brakes, front and rear seat side airbags, side curtain  airbags and front knee airbags. The XLE Premium and Limited come with blind spot  monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. Also standard on the Limited is Toyota's  Safety Connect service, which includes roadside assistance, stolen vehicle  location and automatic collision notification. The Limited's optional Toyota Safety Sense package  includes a frontal pre-collision warning and mitigation system with pedestrian  detection, lane departure alert with steering assist, adaptive cruise control  and auto high-beam control.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Avalon Hybrid stopped from 60  mph in 132 feet, about 5 feet longer than average for the segment.\nIn government crash protection ratings, the 2016 Avalon  Hybrid received four  out of five stars for frontal crash and rollover protection. Previous model  year Avalon Hybrids, built on the same platform, also received five out of five  stars for overall crash performance and for side crash protection. In testing  by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the otherwise similar non-hybrid  Avalon scored a \"Good\" rating (the highest possible) in the  moderate-overlap frontal-offset, small-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and  roof-strength crash tests. The Avalon's seat and head restraint design was also  rated \"Good\" by the IIHS for whiplash protection in rear impacts. Acceleration can best be described as adequate. The Avalon is  a big car, so its 200-hp engine and electric motor have their hands full. The  Avalon Hybrid is exceptionally quiet, however, though the CVT can cause the  engine to drone during sustained acceleration.\nThis big sedan also feels respectably secure and sure-footed  around turns. The brakes can feel grabby under light braking, but that's common  for hybrids, and most owners should acclimate to them fairly quickly. In  general, the Avalon Hybrid is just plain easy to drive. The ride quality is  firmer than Avalons of old, though, so if you're coming out of an older model, make  sure you give this new car a thorough test-drive. The Avalon Hybrid's interior is spacious and elegant, with  high-quality materials throughout. The front seats are very comfortable and  highly adjustable, with plenty of side bolstering and lumbar support for both  the driver and the front passenger. As you'd expect for this class of car, the  Avalon's rear seats are quite roomy.\nAll Avalon Hybrids come standard with Toyota's Entune infotainment system, with swipe  capability, a customizable 7-inch home screen, voice recognition training and  cache radio that can rewind up to 20 minutes. The XLE Premium and Limited come  standard with additional smartphone app integration and navigation.\nStorage cubbies provide ample room for keys and wallets, and  the center console is large. The front section of the center console acts as a  convenient \"eBin\" with power cords passing through a sliding panel  for cell phones (two 12-volt outlets for the Plus trim, one for the Premium and  Limited trims) and auxiliary and USB connections. This area is also home to the Qi wireless charging system that's  standard on the Premium and Limited trims. Toyota is among the first automakers  to offer wireless charging for Qi-compatible cell phones. We like its  convenience, but it doesn't charge very quickly. All trims also have an  additional 12-volt outlet in the center console's regular storage compartment.\nThe Hybrid's trunk offers 14 cubic feet of space. That's  less than typical large sedans, but still enough for most situations. \nThe XLE Plus comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels,  automatic headlights, heated mirrors, a power sunroof, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, dual-zone automatic climate control, full power accessories, cruise  control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, leather upholstery, heated  front seats, an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar support) and a  four-way power front passenger seat. Electronics features include keyless  ignition and entry, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a rearview camera  and Toyota's Entune Audio Plus setup that includes a 7-inch touchscreen display,  voice controls and an eight-speaker audio system with a CD player, satellite  radio, an auxiliary audio jack and a USB/iPod interface.\n\nThere aren't many  full-size sedans that offer the same level of comfort and efficiency as the  2016 Avalon Hybrid.\nThe XLE Premium adds foglights, driver memory settings, blind  spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, Qi wireless charging and Entune Premium  Audio with Navigation and App Suite, which includes nine speakers, a navigation  system and smartphone app integration.\nThe Limited includes all the above plus xenon headlights,  auto-dimming power side mirrors, automatic wipers, upgraded leather upholstery,  a 10-way power driver seat, an eight-way power passenger seat, ventilated front  seats, heated rear seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, a rear power  sunshade, ambient lighting, Toyota's Safety Connect system and an 11-speaker  JBL premium sound system. The Limited also offers an optional Toyota Safety Sense  package (see Safety section below) with a suite of active safety systems.",

    "full_description": "The 2015 Toyota Sequoia now gets a sunroof and a rearview camera as standard. With seating for eight, plenty of versatility and user-friendly features, the 2015 Toyota Sequoia is a good choice among traditional full-size SUVs. If your needs are less extreme, though, a large, three-row crossover will likely serve you better. Let's say you've got a boat, some water skis, a spouse, six  kids and their stuff. Now all you need is a vehicle to haul them around on your  summer vacation. With its 2015 Sequoia full-size SUV, Toyota may just be able  to help.\nWhile the Sequoia hasn't received any significant changes  this year (or for the last several years, for that matter) it's still a viable choice  for a big family. The Sequoia is built on the same basic architecture as the rugged  Toyota Tundra pickup. Yet the Sequoia is pretty comfortable on the road,  especially when you equip it with the optional adaptive air suspension. The  Sequoia received an Edmunds \"B\"  rating, but it got high marks for comfort, thanks to an exceptionally quiet  ride.\nFor power, there's only one engine available in the 2015  Toyota Sequoia, but it's capable of towing up to 7,400 pounds. And even though  the Sequoia is a pretty hulking vehicle, acceleration is quick. When you want  to venture off the pavement, the Sequoia is more capable on trails or over  rocks than is the norm for this class of vehicle.\nHowever capable it is, though, it is also a bit stale. It  hasn't been redesigned in years, and its age is beginning to show. Interior  quality is lacking, and the stereo controls are located far away from the  driver. Rivals have also moved the chains in regard to fuel economy, and the Sequoia's  fuel economy rating of just 14 mpg combined is pretty low.\nThat said, the other full-size SUVs on the market aren't necessarily  superior overall. The 2015  Chevrolet Tahoe, and its larger Suburban brother, received a recent redesign.  Both are quiet and have richer, more modern interiors, but both received  \"C\" ratings from our editors for a variety of reasons. The 2015 Ford  Expedition is a better alternative. It received a less substantial overhaul  than its Chevrolet competitors, but benefits from a fuel-efficient turbocharged  six-cylinder engine and, like the Sequoia, features a better designed fold-flat  third-row seat.\nOf course, if you don't need the sort of max capabilities  offered by these truck-based beasts of burden like the Sequoia, a large  crossover like the 2015  Chevrolet Traverse or the Edmunds \"A\"-rated Toyota  Highlander will deliver room for a big family but with lower fuel  consumption and a less cumbersome driving experience. The 2015 Toyota Sequoia comes standard with a 5.7-liter V8  engine rated at 381 hp and 401 pound-feet of torque. The V8 is paired with a  six-speed automatic transmission, and rear-wheel drive is standard. A  four-wheel-drive system with low-range gearing and a locking limited-slip  center differential is available as an option.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, a Sequoia Premium 4WD went  from zero to 60 mph in 6.9 seconds.\nAs you'd expect from a full-size, truck-based SUV, EPA-estimated fuel economy is low at 15 mpg combined (13 city/18 highway) with rear-wheel drive, and 14 combined (13/17) with 4WD. This is much lower than its competitors' fuel economy.\nDepending on your choice of trim level and whether you get  two- or four-wheel drive, the Sequoia is capable of towing between 7,100 and 7,400  pounds. Standard safety equipment for all 2015 Toyota Sequoia models  includes antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, trailer sway  control, front knee airbags, front seat side-impact airbags, full-length side  curtain airbags and a rearview camera. The Limited adds standard front and rear  parking sensors. Adaptive cruise control and a blind spot monitoring system are  standard on the Platinum.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Sequoia needed 125 feet to  come to a stop from 60 mph, an average distance for a vehicle of this size. There may not be multiple engines to choose from in the 2015  Toyota Sequoia, but the gutsy 5.7-liter V8 isn't a slouch. This engine provides  impressive acceleration, even in this large, heavy vehicle. The six-speed  automatic transmission also performs flawlessly, with smooth, predictable  shifts in everyday driving.\nThe Sequoia's ride quality is quite smooth for its class,  especially compared to its more trucklike GM competitors, and should feel downright  plush with the adaptive air suspension. The Sequoia also stands out with its  available locking center differential and low-range gearbox, which makes it  more capable off-road than most big family vehicles. As with its competitors,  though, there's no getting around the Sequoia's supersized dimensions and  challenging outward visibility. Maneuvering in tight confines like parking  garages can be a hassle, but the standard rearview camera certainly helps. Inside the 2015 Toyota Sequoia you'll find a spacious and  comfortable cabin with room for as many as eight passengers. Models fitted with  the available second-row captain's chairs have a bit more of a deluxe feel, but  it's hard to find fault with the standard 40/20/40-split bench. Its individual  sections can be reclined, adjusted farther back for greater comfort or scooted  forward to keep youngsters close at hand. The third row also reclines.\nThe quality of both the materials and construction is  average, creating a decent environment that belies the Sequoia's rugged  truck-based origins. Gauges and controls are generally well-placed and easy to  use, with the exception of the Entune touchscreen audio controls that require a long reach for many drivers. Also, getting started with Entune's available suite of  smartphone apps can take some extra time since you have to install an app on  your phone and register for an account; plus, you always need an active data  connection to use it.\nWith all seats in place, you'll find 18.9 cubic feet of  space. This matches the Ford Expedition, but is a few cubes more than a  Chevrolet Tahoe and many more than most large crossovers. Behind the second row,  the Sequoia shines with a healthy 66.6 cubic feet of cargo space, while folding  everything down opens up a cavernous 120-cubic-foot cargo hold, which is  considerably more than the Tahoe and Expedition (only a Chevrolet Suburban or  Expedition EL would be bigger). Plus, the third-row seats fold flat without the  sort of awkward, raised load floor found in the Chevy SUVs. \nThe base trim level SR5 model comes with lots of standard  features, including 18-inch alloy wheels, foglights, a windshield wiper  de-icer, heated mirrors, a sunroof, keyless entry, a roof rack, running boards,  rear privacy glass, a power-lowering rear window and towing preparation. Inside  you get tri-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, an eight-way power driver  seat, a 40/20/40-split second-row bench seat (with sliding and reclining  functionality), a 60/40-split reclining and fold-flat third-row bench, second-  and third-row side sunshades, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a rearview  camera integrated into the auto-dimming rearview mirror, Bluetooth phone and  audio connectivity, and an eight-speaker audio system with Toyota's Entune 6.1-inch  touchscreen, CD player, satellite radio, HD radio, an auxiliary audio jack and a  USB/iPod interface.\nOptions for the SR5 include a Sport package with 20-inch  chrome-clad alloy wheels, a color-keyed grille and second-row captain's chairs  (reducing seating capacity to seven). The separately available Premium package retains  eight-passenger seating and bundles leather upholstery, power driver seat  lumbar adjustment, a four-way power passenger seat, heated front seats and a  power-reclining and -folding third-row seat.\nStepping up to the Limited model gets you 20-inch alloy  wheels, power-folding and auto-dimming outside mirrors, front and rear parking  sensors and a power liftgate. Inside, everything from the SR5's Premium package  is included as standard, along with a leather-wrapped steering wheel,  leather-trimmed doors, upgraded gauges, a rearview camera display integrated into  the higher-resolution 7-inch touchscreen, a navigation system and a full suite  of smartphone apps such as Pandora and OpenTable.

    "full_description": "A less-expensive model joins the 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid lineup. The 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a solid midsize crossover SUV that accommodates the needs of most families while delivering the fuel economy and performance benefits of hybrid technology. However, its mid-$30Ks base price can make it tough to justify over a regular Highlander. As revolutionary as early hybrid cars were, not everyone could take advantage of this technology because of their space and seating capacity constraints. That's where the Toyota Highlander Hybrid comes in. Introduced last year, it is the first and only seven-passenger (with optional third-row seat) hybrid vehicle, allowing family-oriented buyers to make an environmental statement when they pull up in the elementary school carpool circle. In truth, though, the cramped third-row seat is only minimally useful. Although the Highlander Hybrid has an EPA highway fuel economy rating of 33 mpg, the point of driving this hybrid SUV is not necessarily the promise of stellar fuel economy. Rather, Toyota is hoping buyers will see the performance angle as well, as the Highlander pairs a healthy V6 gas engine with a couple of electric motors to deliver extremely quick acceleration for the midsize SUV class.In creating the hybrid Highlander, Toyota started with the regular Highlander's optional 3.3-liter V6, recalibrated it for duty in a hybrid (it makes less horsepower in this application) and installed two electric motors (three on all-wheel-drive models). One of the motors is responsible for starting the gas engine and recharging the 288-volt battery pack. Another teams up with the V6 to drive the front wheels via a continuously variable transmission of sorts that Toyota calls a \"power-split device.\" This simplified CVT provides the ease of a conventional automatic transmission, but there are no gears to shift, drive belts, torque converter or clutch. The third motor, present only on all-wheel-drive models, can power the rear wheels when extra acceleration or traction is needed, or help recharge the battery pack. Since the gas V6 never provides power to the rear wheels of AWD Highlander Hybrids, however, it's not a true all-wheel-drive setup. Buyers who need a serious snow vehicle should stick with the regular Highlander.Driving a 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a lot like driving a regular V6 Highlander -- it's just a lot quicker. Still, the lack of conventional shift points can take some adjustment, as can the gas engine's tendency to rev at a consistently high rpm -- also a function of the hybrid drivetrain. Ride quality is as smooth as ever, but with the extra weight of the hybrid system, handling is even less athletic than it is on the regular Highlander (already notable for its modest limits).Still, compared to the other non-premium hybrid SUVs that are available, the Ford Escape Hybrid and Saturn Vue Green Line, the Highlander Hybrid is much quicker and more refined. Unfortunately, it's also more expensive, and the Escape, which uses a Toyota-designed hybrid system, gets better fuel economy. Neither can match the Highlander's interior room, but if space is what you need, you may be better off with a traditional gasoline SUV like the Honda Pilot or Mazda CX-9: Your mileage will be lower, but the initial cost will be less. That's not to say a 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid purchase won't make you happy, but potential buyers should be aware that hybrid SUV ownership isn't likely to be the most cost-effective option for family transportation. The hybrid drivetrain in the 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid consists of a gasoline 3.3-liter V6 rated for 208 hp and two electric motors (three on AWD models). One of the motors is responsible for starting the gas engine and recharging the 288-volt battery pack. The second motor joins forces with the V6 to drive the front wheels via a simplified continuously variable transmission. All-wheel-drive Highlander Hybrids get a third motor that provides power to the rear wheels when extra acceleration or traction is needed. Cumulative output for this hybrid drivetrain is 268 horsepower. Acceleration is swift for an SUV in this price range -- we've timed an AWD Highlander Hybrid at 7.2 seconds for the 0-60-mph run.Fuel economy ratings for the Toyota Highlander Hybrid are 33 mpg city/28 mpg highway on front-drive (2WD) models and 31/27 on AWD models. Towing is possible in the Highlander Hybrid, as it can pull up to 3,500 pounds when properly equipped, but off-roading is not recommended. Front-seat side airbags and first- and second-row side curtain airbags are standard on all Highlander Hybrids. Also standard are antilock disc brakes with brake assist, traction control and stability control. The regular Highlander's crash test ratings apply to the Hybrid model. In NHTSA crash testing, the Toyota Highlander scored five stars (out of a possible five) for frontal-impact protection. In side-impact tests, it again received five stars for both front and rear passengers. In frontal offset crash testing administered by the IIHS, the Toyota earned a \"Good\" rating (the best possible). First-time Highlander Hybrid drivers may experience a split-second of doubt when they twist the key in the ignition and hear nothing, as the SUV starts out in all-electric mode. Ease into the accelerator and you'll hear only the peaceful hum of an electric motor until you hit about 25 mph or blast the A/C. Acceleration is excellent at any speed, and the hybrid Highlander feels particularly swift in merging and passing situations. The lack of conventional shift points can take a little getting used to, though. Additionally, the gasoline V6 tends to be noisier in the hybrid version than it is in the regular Highlander, as the efficiency-oriented CVT often sends it soaring to high rpm during heavy acceleration. The added weight of the hybrid system gives the 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid a somewhat cumbersome feel around tight turns. It's still easy to maneuver in the city, though, and as smooth as they come on the highway. The interior of the 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is identical to that of the gasoline-only version, which means that it has a slightly dated look but features high-quality materials and solid ergonomics. Comfortable seating in the first- and second-rows and a total of 10 cupholders make the Highlander Hybrid a natural for family transportation, but newer competitors in the midsize crossover SUV class offer roomier second-row accommodations. Additionally, the second-row seat's lack of a flip-and-fold mechanism makes the third row difficult to access. Maximum cargo capacity is 80.6 cubic feet, just as in the regular Highlander. Options on both models include a sunroof and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system. Leather upholstery and a navigation system are exclusive options for the Limited.",

    "full_description": "The 2007 Toyota Sienna benefits from a major power upgrade, as a new 266-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 replaces last year's 3.3-liter engine. This makes the Sienna the most powerful minivan on the market. In other news, all '07 Siennas with CD changers are satellite radio-ready (Sirius), and the standard tire-pressure monitoring system now has sensors for each tire (resulting in more accurate readings). The available 17-inch alloy wheels have a new finish. Roomy, comfortable and well-built, the 2007 Toyota Sienna minivan is an easy choice, especially if you have a big family. Since its last redesign in 2004, the Toyota Sienna has been a top pick in the minivan class. Whether you're a new parent, an empty nester or somewhere in between, it will almost certainly meet your needs. As you'd expect of a Toyota minivan, it rides smoothly, returns respectable gas mileage and has excellent safety ratings. It's also one of the roomiest minivans on the market, and in addition to offering comfortable seating in all three rows, it's one of the few models with a bench seat option in the second row -- a boon for large families in need of eight-passenger capacity. The Sienna is also notable for its extensive list of convenience features, offering items like a telescoping steering wheel, adaptive cruise control and rear sunshades that can't be had on other vans. And it's the only 2007 minivan with an all-wheel-drive option.In the past, high pricing and a tepid driving experience were typically regarded as the major weaknesses of the current-generation van. Toyota has partially improved the driving experience this year by installing a new 3.5-liter V6. Rated for 266 horsepower, the 2007 Sienna's new V6 offers a 50-hp increase over last year's engine, along with considerably more torque. Besides feeling more energetic in traffic, the Sienna should get about the same fuel economy as before. There's no increase in consumption on front-wheel-drive models, and AWD Siennas actually see a slight improvement in their city mileage. Although quick, the Toyota Sienna still isn't the van to get if you like to drive. Sporty handling dynamics might seem like more of a luxury than a necessity in a minivan, but several competitors have succeeded at working them into the mix, and the Sienna, while competent, feels soft and flabby in comparison.That said, the 2007 Toyota Sienna remains one of the most refined minivans out there, and its high-quality materials and construction are evident from the moment you step inside. If this is the van you decide to park in your garage, you won't get any objections from our staff. However, we do think you would be wise to try the Honda Odyssey, which is the better all-around minivan, and the Hyundai Entourage/Kia Sedona twins, which offer solid qualifications in most areas and bargain pricing. The 2007 Toyota Sienna is powered by a superb 3.5-liter V6 engine with 266 hp coupled to a five-speed automatic transmission. This refined combination results in strong performance as well as above-average gas mileage, with EPA figures of 20 mpg in the city and 27 on the highway for front-drive models and 18/23 for all-wheel-drive vans. Antilock brakes and a tire-pressure monitoring system are standard across the line. Most 2007 Toyota Siennas have front disc/rear drum brakes, but four-wheel discs are standard on the XLE Limited and AWD models, along with stability and traction control -- these items are optional on all other Siennas. Standard airbag protection includes seat-mounted side airbags for front occupants and side curtain airbags that cover all three rows. The XLE Limited comes with front and rear parking sensors, but oddly, this valuable safety item isn't available as a factory option on any other Sienna. A rearview camera is included if you order the navigation system on the XLE or XLE Limited.Like the other leading minivans, the Toyota Sienna boasts impressive safety ratings. In NHTSA crash testing, the Sienna earned four out of five stars for driver protection in frontal impacts and five stars for the front passenger. It earned five stars across the board for side-impact crash protection. The IIHS gave Toyota's van a \"Good\" rating (its highest) for its performance in frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. Although the Sienna's automatic transmission is tuned more for fuel economy than performance and thus tends to shift conservatively, there's no denying the potency of the new V6 when you stomp on the gas pedal. Acceleration is more than ample in most situations, and the engine delivers its power in a highly refined manner. Ride quality is smooth and comfortable, but the 2007 Toyota Sienna offers little inspiration in the handling department. It feels secure enough when going around corners, but with minimal steering feedback and considerable body roll, it's not a minivan you'll relish driving. Braking distances are on par with the rest of the minivan class, but pedal feel is a little vague. The Sienna's interior is swathed in high-quality fabric on lower trim levels and leather and faux wood on high-end models. Most controls are simple to use, storage space is abundant and the seats are plush. Seven-passenger vans allow owners to push the second-row captain's chairs together to create a bench seat. The eight-passenger version uses a 40/20/40-split bench in the second row, enabling you to pull the middle seat 13 inches closer to the front seats for easier access. The Sienna provides 149 cubic feet of cargo capacity -- second only to the Chrysler minivans. The base Sienna CE includes 16-inch steel wheels; dual sliding rear doors with power-down windows; separate front and rear air-conditioners; a six-speaker CD stereo with an MP3 player input jack; a telescoping steering wheel; power mirrors and locks; keyless entry and towing preparation. The LE adds privacy glass, a roof rack, heated mirrors, driver-seat lumbar adjustment, a cabin air filter, an in-dash CD changer, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, cruise control and upgraded instrumentation. The Sienna XLE features alloy wheels, power-sliding doors, a power liftgate, auto headlamps, tri-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, wood-grain interior trim, a trip computer and a removable center console. For the top-of-the-line XLE Limited trim level, Toyota adds 17-inch wheels, xenon HID headlights, a moonroof, adaptive cruise control, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a leather/wood steering wheel, an upgraded 10-speaker JBL sound system, rear window shades and a windshield wiper de-icer. All-wheel-drive Siennas automatically receive 17-inch wheels, run-flat tires and the wiper de-icer.Options on the Toyota Sienna are grouped in numbered packages, and you'll need to study them carefully to ensure the one you pick has all the features you want. Notable items include a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, a navigation system (with a backup camera and Bluetooth), a power-folding third-row seat and a pair of 115-volt power outlets.",

    "full_description": "A more powerful four-cylinder engine, a restyled grille and bumpers and the adoption of active headrests for the front seats mark the changes for the 2009 Toyota RAV4. Spacious, comfortable and easy to drive, the 2009 Toyota RAV4 is a top pick for a crossover SUV, especially if you want a V6 or a usable kid-size third-row seat. Like the Tin Man in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" a body of metal is nothing without a heart. Thankfully, the 2009 Toyota RAV4 -- when fitted with the optional V6 -- has plenty of heart, thanks to 269 horsepower, potent acceleration and a modest appetite for fuel. In fact, this V6 gets about the same fuel economy as some four-cylinder-equipped competitors.The RAV4's four-cylinder engine gets a power boost for 2009, to 179 hp, making it the class leader among rival fours. Fuel economy has increased slightly with this engine as well. A new grille and bumper design further modernize the latest RAV4. And with a cavernous 73 cubic feet of cargo space and room for five adults, the current RAV4 presents a nice balance of roomy functionality and ease of maneuverability. There's even a third-row seat available, though it's only roomy enough for children.As much as we like the 2009 Toyota RAV4, there are still a few competing models you might want to check out. Family-bound driving enthusiasts might enjoy the more intimate connection to the road provided by the Mazda CX-7 or Mitsubishi Outlander. And unless you really need a third-row seat, the Honda CR-V is a more well-rounded and luxurious choice. Still, the RAV4 is hard to beat for families in search of a vehicle that offers plenty of space, power, features and value. The 2009 RAV4 comes standard with a new 2.5-liter four-cylinder that delivers a healthy 179 hp and 172 pound-feet of torque. A four-speed automatic transmission is standard. Optional on all trim levels and coupled to a five-speed automatic transmission is a 3.5-liter V6 that produces an impressive 269 hp and 246 lb-ft of torque. In performance testing, the RAV4 V6 4WD delivered a very quick 0-60 time of 7.2 seconds.All RAV4s can be equipped with either front-wheel or four-wheel drive. Front-drive models have a limited-slip differential. In 4WD models, the electronic 4WD system sends most of the power to the front wheels until slippage is detected, at which point power is also sent to the rear wheels. Unlike many competing vehicles, the RAV4 offers a true 4WD lock feature that fixes the front/rear power split 50/50, which is useful for driving in snow and light off-roading.The EPA estimates a four-cylinder, front-drive RAV4 gets 22 mpg in the city/28 mpg on the highway and 24 mpg combined. The 4WD model has a 21/27/24 mpg rating. The V6 gets virtually the same fuel economy as four-cylinder crossovers, with 19 mpg city/27 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined ratings for the front-drive version. Four-wheel drive results in a loss of only 1 mpg on the highway. Antilock disc brakes, stability control, traction control, active front headrests, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags are standard on every 2009 Toyota RAV4. Vehicles equipped with the V6 and/or the optional third-row seats also come with hill-start assist and downhill assist control.In crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the RAV4 earned a perfect five stars for driver protection in frontal impacts and four stars for front passenger protection. It earned five stars for front- and rear-occupant protection in side impacts. Toyota's smallest SUV also performed well in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests, earning the top rating of \"Good\" in both the frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. Although relatively capable off the beaten path, the 2009 Toyota RAV4 is meant for -- and succeeds -- at a life on pavement. Its taut suspension and quick electric steering (which can nevertheless feel a little vague) make daily errands much more enjoyable than they would be in most SUVs. The RAV4 is not as athletic as the Honda CR-V or Mazda CX-7, but in trade, the Toyota offers a smooth ride that's forgiving enough for commuters who drive on crumbling expressways. Road noise can be an issue at times, but wind noise is well-controlled.If we were to buy a RAV4, it would have to come with the optional V6. Despite having 100-plus more horses than most four-cylinder SUVs, the V6-equipped RAV4 manages to get almost the same fuel economy. The four-cylinder version, however, is a reasonable choice for most buyers, as it provides adequate power for day-to-day driving. Inside the RAV4 is a clean design with large, simple controls and lots of storage space. The cabin isn't as plasticky as previous-generation RAV4 cabins were, but it still has a budget feel compared to competitors like the Honda CR-V, Hyundai Santa Fe and Nissan Rogue. Nevertheless, the Toyota offers a highly practical design. The rear seats recline and can slide forward or backward to optimize passenger space or cargo capacity. Normal seating capacity is five, while the optional third-row seat bumps it to seven. Though this seat is meant only for children, it is at least reasonably sturdy and spacious.To configure the RAV4 for cargo, all you need to do is flip a lever. There is no need to remove headrests or fold up seat cushions to get a flat load floor that can hold a maximum of 73 cubic feet of cargo. The load floor is also quite low for this class, which minimizes the strain of loading a week's worth of groceries. However, the Toyota's side-hinged tailgate can be an inconvenience when you're parked on the street, as it opens toward the curb. Standard features for the base RAV4 include 16-inch steel wheels (17-inch alloys are optional), full power accessories, keyless entry, cruise control, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel and a six-speaker stereo with a CD/MP3 player and an auxiliary audio jack. The Sport adds 18-inch alloy wheels, rear tinted windows, a sport-tuned suspension, foglights, heated side mirrors and several exterior details. The range-topping Limited trim includes 17-inch wheels for a smoother ride, dual-zone automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and an in-dash six-CD changer with satellite radio (optional on the two lower trims).Options include a Sport Appearance Package for the V6 4WD models that will get you run-flat tires, a different rear door without the mounted spare tire and an upgraded audio system with a six-CD changer and satellite radio. Optional on the Limited and Sport trims are a sunroof, leather seating, a power driver seat, a back-up camera and an upgraded nine-speaker stereo system with satellite radio and Bluetooth. Exclusive for the Limited trim are optional heated front seats and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system. The exact content and availability of Toyota's option packages can vary based on region.",

    "full_description": "The  Toyota 4Runner is an SUV in the traditional sense, with a body-on-frame  construction and a solid rear axle like a pickup truck. It is one of the last  SUVs built this way, giving it the rugged capability that made this type of  vehicle attractive in the first place.  \nWhile  serviceable as a daily driver, the 4Runner is home on adverse terrain. Off-road  prowess comes from its high ground clearance and available hardware such as a  locking rear differential, low-range gearing and Toyota's trick Kinetic Dynamic  Suspension System (KDSS). The latter consists of special stabilizer bars that  automatically adjust to allow for greater wheel travel (and therefore traction)  in off-road driving situations. \nAn  available third row expands seating capacity to seven at the expense of some  cargo space and versatility. But really, don't get a 4Runner if all you need is  a mall crawler or family taxi. In that case, there are better choices, including  Toyota's Highlander. But the 4Runner is one of the few vehicles left from the  traditional SUV mold, and that's something to appreciate if you need a vehicle  for frequent off-road weekend excursions.Notably, we picked the 2018 4Runner as one of Edmunds' Best Midsize SUVs for 2018. The  2018 Toyota 4Runner favors the kind of terrain you won't find in a shopping  mall parking lot. This truck-based SUV has all the hardware you'll need for  off-road adventures. But those looking for daily-driver civility will find more  comfortable and technologically superior solutions elsewhere. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2018 Toyota 4Runner Limited(4.0L V6 |  5-speed automatic | 4WD). The 4Runner exhibits surprisingly smooth, linear and powerful acceleration. Tall gearing and five speeds keep it in the powerband longer, unlike many of today's crossovers that shift to highest gears as quickly as possible. There's no insufferable lag, just ample thrust. It's not fast, but the V6 is surprisingly strong. The brake pedal has a nebulous feel through two-thirds of the pedal travel, so drivers might need some time to get accustomed to pedal feel for consistently smooth stops. Plenty of stopping power remains in the last third of the pedal travel. There's an abundance of nosedive in emergency stops. Similar to the brakes, not a lot of real feel comes through the wheel, but the truck responds quickly and accurately. Steering effort is a bit heavy at higher speeds, but it's not fatiguing. At low speeds, it offers an appropriate amount of assist. The 4Runner is surprisingly stable, even in tight, short turns. Body roll isn't excessive. Controlling it requires deliberate easing off throttle, braking, settling, then stabbing the throttle midcorner. The Limited-specific suspension system is at work here, trying its best to make the 4Runner feel slightly luxurious. Smooth throttle delivery and seamless shifting make the 4Runner feel less like a truck and more like a crossover, but it's not quite either. The transmission's five available gears enable the driver to wring maximum thrust from the six-cylinder engine, but additional gears would be better in the name of fuel economy. The 4Runner excels off-road, but the Limited model is the least capable due to its 20-inch wheels and low-hanging front fascia. SR5 and TRD models have superior chin clearance and better-suited wheels and tires. The TRD Off-Road trim has a lockable rear diff, and it's the only one with available disconnecting stabilizer bars. The broad cushions and seatbacks offer a wide surface area for long-distance comfort, although lumbar support feels overly firm. With the optional third-row seating package, the second-row seats can slide and recline, but the third row is for kids only or short trips with average-size adults. The ride is not quite crossover-smooth, but it's not truck-brutish either. It bounces around on crummy pavement. But if you've driven trucks and can tolerate the kind of vibrations and jostling that can creep into a truck's ride, you'll find the 4Runner more than acceptable because it rides better than a pickup. The isolation of road noise is good most of the time, but the squarish shape isn't particularly adept at quelling wind noise. It's not unreasonable or out of place here, though. If you can get past that the controls look like they're from a Tonka set, they're otherwise large and easy to use. The climate system works swiftly and without delay, too. That's a big ask since the cabin is quite large, but front passengers get relief in two minutes or less. The seat cooling fans are noisy. The switchgear is big, logical and easy to use, but it looks ancient in 2018. This stuff looked dated in 2008. The infotainment screen is laughably small, too. This off-road-biased 4x4 naturally comes with a higher step-up height relative to standard crossovers. Access to the front and rear is similar, but grab handles make it easier to gain leverage on entry. Shorter drivers will need to learn to spring up into the seats. The doors open nice and wide. The driving position is better and more natural than in previous generations. The 4Runner offers all the command of a crossover with all the off-road chops of a mountain goat. Drivers of all sizes will be able to find a good position, although adjustable pedals would be a nice addition. There's plenty of front head- and legroom for tall passengers, although the Limited trim's sunroof consumes some headroom. The back has plenty of headroom but a bit less legroom. But the sliding and reclining rear seats should help even 6-foot-tall passengers find a comfy setting. It's surprisingly easy to see over the hood and toward the front corners, perhaps due to the simple and boxy design. There's good visibility out the back window, further enhanced by a backup camera. The rear quarters have the usual SUV blind spots, but a fairly level sightline out the sides offers good around-view visibility. The 4Runner has tight gaps outside and an attractive interior. The leather upholstery looks good and should hold up over the long haul, even if it spends most of its time off-roading. For such a roomy cabin, there's not a lot of places to stash personal items. The door pockets can hold a slim water bottle and some smaller, flat items. The center console is deep and wide enough for a cluster of wallets, phones, keys, small items, and maybe an iPad Mini. You'll be hunting for stash spaces. The rear seatbacks fold flat, and it's easy to pack the sizable cargo hold (88.8 cubic feet with seats down; 46.3 cubic feet with seats up) because of its squarish shape. Car campers will love it since it's easy to stretch out a couple of sleeping bags in the back. The cargo floor is almost but not quite flat. A leather flap backed with Velcro covers the LATCH anchors, but it's easy to pull back and access them. Three tethers are located behind each rear seat. The roomy second row can accommodate car seats in any of the three positions, even bulkier rear-facing models. The square door openings make for easy access. There's 5,000 pounds of towing capacity, a useful figure that covers most boats and many small camping trailers. The 4Runner doesn't offer a factory electric trailer brake controller, though. You'll have to go aftermarket to add that capability. The navigation system is basic. Most smartphone-based nav apps are more powerful and sophisticated. The 6-inch display is small enough to make you wonder why Toyota bothered. The JBL audio system is decent but lacks power and volume. There's no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, just Toyota's basic Entune app suite. USB and Bluetooth audio/phone connections are here, though, and offer a suitable workaround to the clunky Entune interface. There's a surprising lack of common driver aids such as blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, parking sensors or automatic emergency braking. This 4Runner does truly keep it old-school. The rudimentary controls require very specific syntax and speech patterns. Most drivers will have better luck using the voice assistants on their phones. Because  the value of the 4Runner lies predominantly in its off-road capabilities, we  recommend the TRD Off-Road Premium.  This trim gives access to important hardware including the locking rear  differential and KDSS, the latter of which improves all areas of the 4Runner's  skill set. The Premium part of that name means it has comfort features,  including heated front seats, easy-clean vinyl upholstery, heated power outside  mirrors and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. The SR5 is the base model but it's not  bare-bones. Standard features includes skid plates, foglights, a rearview  camera, a power liftgate (includes a power rear window), 17-inch wheels,  keyless entry, power-adjustable front seats, 40/20/40-split reclining and  folding second-row seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a 120-volt power  outlet in the rear cargo area. The standard infotainment system boasts a  6.1-inch touchscreen, eight speakers, a USB port and satellite radio. Stepping  up to TRD Off-Road adds a locking  rear differential, 17-inch wheels that are 0.5 inch wider than the SR5's, and a  crawl control function. The interior wears additional TRD badging, and the  overhead console gains switches for controlling off-road settings. The KDSS  feature is optional. Premium variants of the SR5 and TRD Off-Road  get power-adjustable and heated outside mirrors, simulated leather upholstery,  heated front seats, navigation, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. Serious  off-roaders should consider the TRD Pro,  which starts with the TRD Off-Road Premium and adds revised front springs, Bilstein  dampers with rear remote reservoirs, special all-terrain tires and a front skid  plate. Limited models top the 4Runner range and are  more luxury oriented. These models get a Torsen locking center differential  (4x4 models only), a separate suspension system Toyota calls X-REAS that's  designed to reduce roll without adversely affecting ride quality, plus a host  of features to make it better suited to on-pavement use: 20-inch wheels, a  sunroof, dual-zone climate control, parking sensors, leather seat upholstery,  heated and ventilated front seats, and a 15-speaker JBL audio system.  Power-deploying running boards are optional.",

    "full_description": "For 2013, the Toyota Camry Hybrid receives rear cross traffic alert functionality as part of the optional blind spot monitoring system. Inside, all Hybrids have the 6-inch central display screen as standard and slightly upgraded door panel trim. The 2013 Toyota Camry Hybrid is a great choice for a hybrid family sedan, thanks to impressive fuel economy, solid driving dynamics and an accommodating interior. As with the standard Camry, Toyota  gave its Camry Hybrid a complete  redesign last year that brought about a sharper look, notably improved the  interior quality and pumped up its driving dynamics. The 2013 Toyota Camry  Hybrid stays the course, but gains a few features that enhance convenience,  safety and cabin ambience.\nForget those notions of a hybrid being sluggish in the name  of fuel conservation. The Camry Hybrid provides both brisk acceleration and  high fuel economy. Zero to 60 in just 7.4 seconds might not be sports car  territory, but it's quicker than the regular four-cylinder Camry and you get an  impressive EPA estimate of 41 mpg combined in the deal. For most folks shopping  this segment, the Camry Hybrid will strike an ideal balance between its expectedly  plush ride and decent handling.\nCompared to the Hyundai Sonata  Hybrid, the 2013 Toyota  Camry Hybrid offers a smoother-operating hybrid system and better fuel economy.  The new Ford Fusion Hybrid,  however, is tough to beat, as it boasts the segment's highest mileage ratings  along with solid performance and handsome styling. There's also the new  Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid, which looks good on paper but is yet unproven in this  new-for-VW segment. As such, the Camry Hybrid stands as one of the top picks  for a well-rounded, gas-sipping family car.  The 2013 Toyota Camry Hybrid pairs a 2.5-liter four-cylinder  engine with 156 horsepower and 156 pound-feet of torque with an electric motor/battery  pack. At low speeds the car can be propelled solely by the electric motor,  which is why the Camry Hybrid is so fuel-efficient in city driving. Working  together when full power is needed, the two power sources crank out a combined  output of 200 hp. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) delivers power to  the front wheels.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, a Camry Hybrid XLE accelerated  from zero to 60 mph in 7.4 seconds. That's the swiftest acceleration in this admittedly  small class of hybrid sedans.\nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the Camry Hybrid LE is 43 mpg  city/39 mpg highway and 41 mpg combined. Interestingly, the XLE achieves figures  of 40/38/40, likely due to the higher rolling resistance of its larger wheels  and tires. The 2013 Toyota Camry Hybrid comes with antilock brakes,  stability and traction control, front- and rear-seat side airbags, side curtain  airbags, and knee airbags for both driver and passenger. A blind-spot  monitoring system with rear cross traffic alert is also available.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Camry Hybrid came to a stop  from 60 mph in 116 feet, an excellent result. \nIn government crash testing, the otherwise similar standard  Camry received a top five-star score for overall crash protection, with four  stars for overall frontal protection and five stars for overall side  protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Camry Hybrid  the best possible rating of \"Good\" in the frontal-offset, side and  roof strength tests. It scored a \"Poor\" (the worst rating) in that  agency's new \"small overlap\" frontal impact crash test, but only a  handful of cars have been subjected to it, and most have earned a similarly low  score. The 2013 Toyota Camry Hybrid is dynamically well-rounded.  Thanks to careful suspension tuning, it sticks well to the road and is mostly  undisturbed by bumps and ruts. The electric-assist steering is precise and  quick enough, though it suffers from a lack of feedback and some drivers may  find its effort too light.\nToyota's hybrid system remains the most sophisticated and  refined on the market. The transition from all-electric mode to gasoline engine  is less noticeable than in the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, for example, while its  acceleration is surprisingly strong for a midsize, non-premium brand hybrid  sedan. The interior of the 2013 Toyota Camry feels roomy and its  thin front pillars provide good outward visibility. What the cabin design lacks  in cohesiveness, it makes up for with generally good materials quality, especially  the handsome stitching on the dash and door panels of upper trims. The spacious  rear seat is complemented by a nicely reclined seatback angle that helps the  Camry match the Honda Accord for the most comfortable backseat in the class.\nThe Camry's upgraded audio system also includes Entune, a  suite of smartphone-connected services that includes features like the Bing  search engine, Pandora streaming radio, real-time traffic, sports and stock  information, and the ability to reserve movie tickets or a table at a  restaurant on the go. The touchscreen interface and accompanying steering wheel  controls are usually pretty easy to use, but sometimes the virtual buttons' unwillingness  to respond is frustrating.\nWith 13.1 cubic feet of available space, the trunk offers  respectable capacity for a hybrid, as their attendant battery packs usually  greatly intrude upon trunk space. \nThe LE features 16-inch steel wheels, automatic headlights,  keyless ignition/entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, full power  accessories, cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a trip  computer, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a 6-inch display and a  six-speaker sound system with a CD player, HD radio, satellite radio, an  auxiliary input and a USB/iPod interface.\nThe XLE adds 17-inch alloy wheels, heated exterior mirrors,  a leather-wrapped steering wheel and an eight-way power driver seat.\nAdditional options are available for the XLE but can vary  depending on which region of the country you live in. These include a sunroof,  a rearview camera, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a four-way power  passenger seat, a navigation system, voice recognition, Entune smartphone integration,  a premium 10-speaker JBL audio system and a hard-drive-based navigation system  with a larger touchscreen display.",

    "full_description": "For 2015, the Toyota Avalon Hybrid gets minor upgrades. All models have the next generation of the brand's Entune infotainment system, while the XLE Touring model adds blind spot monitoring with rear cross traffic alert. With its upscale styling, welcoming cabin and impressive fuel economy, the 2015 Toyota Avalon Hybrid earns our respect as a top choice for buyers looking for a fuel-sipping full-size sedan. The leader in the hybrid car segment, Toyota has a total of seven hybrids, ranging  from the subcompact Prius C to the full-size Avalon. The Avalon Hybrid debuted in  2013 as part of the Avalon's redesign. It happens to be a leader in the large-sedan  segment, too, as nothing else comes close to combining comfort, space and high  fuel economy as well as the 2015 Toyota Avalon Hybrid.\nThe mechanical soul of the Avalon Hybrid is its hybrid  powertrain. The same system used in the Camry, it features a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder gasoline engine teamed with an electric motor to create a total  of 200 horsepower. That power is plenty for everyday needs, but the fuel  economy is more impressive. Its EPA-estimated combined fuel economy rating is  40 mpg, which is thriftier than the compact Corolla's, and the 17-gallon fuel  tank gives it a theoretical range of nearly 700 miles.\nLike the standard Avalon, the Avalon Hybrid boasts an attractive  look that you might mistake for a European luxury sedan. The interior continues  the upscale theme with high-quality materials, plenty of space for passengers and  plenty of features. Even a base Avalon comes with keyless ignition and entry,  leather upholstery and a power driver seat as standard. Moving up to the more  expensive versions will get you tech-oriented features like adaptive cruise  control and smartphone app integration through Toyota's latest version of its  Entune system.\nThe Avalon Hybrid is pretty much a class of one, too. The  only other large sedan to offer a hybrid system is the 2015 Buick LaCrosse. We  like the LaCrosse in general, but its hybrid system is nowhere near as  efficient as the Avalon's. Beyond that, you might check out midsize hybrids  like the 2015 Ford Fusion Hybrid, 2015 Honda Accord  Hybrid and Toyota's own Camry Hybrid if you want to save a bit of money (or look at the Avalon-based Lexus ES 300h  if you want to spend more). But overall we find the Edmunds \"B\"rated 2015 Toyota Avalon Hybrid to be one impressive package. The 2015 Toyota Avalon Hybrid is powered by a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor that's fed by a  trunk-mounted battery pack. Combined, the two power units are good for 200 hp.  A continuously variable transmission (CVT) delivers power to the front wheels.\nAccording to EPA estimates, the Avalon Hybrid returns 40 mpg combined (40 city/39 highway). In Edmunds performance testing, an Avalon Hybrid Limited  accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds. This is about a second slower  than the regular, V6-powered Avalon or most other conventional large sedans,  but quite peppy for a hybrid sedan. Standard safety features include traction and stability  control, antilock disc brakes, front and rear seat side airbags, side curtain  airbags and front knee airbags. The XLE Touring and Limited come with blind spot  monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. Also standard on the Limited is  Toyota's Safety Connect service, which includes roadside assistance, stolen vehicle  location and automatic collision notification. The Limited's optional  Technology package includes a frontal pre-collision warning system.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Avalon Hybrid stopped from 60  mph in 132 feet -- about 5 feet longer than average for the segment.\nIn government crash tests, the Avalon Hybrid received five  out of five stars for overall crash protection, with four stars for  frontal-impact protection and five stars for side-impact protection. In testing  by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the otherwise similar non-hybrid  Avalon scored a \"Good\"  rating -- the highest possible -- in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset, small-overlap  frontal-offset, side-impact and roof-strength crash tests. The  Avalon's seat and head restraint design was also rated \"Good\" for  whiplash protection in rear impacts. The 2015 Toyota Avalon Hybrid's 200 hp isn't a whole lot for  a big car like this, but for the most part, acceleration is perfectly adequate.  The Avalon Hybrid is also exceptionally quiet, though the CVT can cause the  engine to drone during acceleration. Otherwise, the Avalon Hybrid is the equal  of other hushed large luxury sedans.\nThis big sedan also feels respectably secure and sure-footed  around turns. The brakes can feel grabby under light braking, but that's pretty  common for hybrids, and most owners should acclimate to them fairly quickly. In  general, the Avalon Hybrid is just plain easy to drive. The ride quality is  firmer than Avalons of old, though, so if you're coming out of an older model, make  sure you give this new car a thorough test-drive. The Avalon Hybrid's interior is spacious and elegant, with  high-quality materials throughout. The front seats are very comfortable and  highly adjustable, with plenty of side bolstering and lumbar support for both  the driver and the front passenger. As you'd expect for this class of car, the  Avalon's rear seats are quite roomy.\nAll Avalons come standard with Toyota's Entune infotainment system,  and the XLE Touring and Limited come standard with additional smartphone app  integration and a larger screen. Toyota has also updated Entune for 2015,  adding swipe capability, a customizable home screen, voice recognition training  and cache radio that can rewind up to 20 minutes.\nStorage cubbies provide ample room for drinks and personal  effects, and the center console is large. The front section of the center  console acts as a convenient \"eBin\" with power cords passing through  a sliding panel for two cell phones and auxiliary and USB connections. This  area is also home to the available Qi wireless charging system. Toyota is among  the first automakers to offer wireless charging for cell phones. We like its  convenience, but it doesn't charge very quickly.\nThe Hybrid's trunk offers 14 cubic feet of space, which is  less than the regular Avalon but still more than what's available from the  typical midsize hybrid sedan. \nThe XLE Premium comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels,  automatic headlights, heated mirrors, a power sunroof, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, dual-zone automatic climate control, full power accessories, cruise  control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, leather upholstery, heated  front seats, an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar support) and a  four-way power front passenger seat. Electronic features include keyless  ignition and entry, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a rearview camera  and Toyota's Entune Audio Plus setup that includes a 6.1-inch touchscreen  display, voice controls and an eight-speaker audio system with a CD player, satellite  radio, an auxiliary audio jack and a USB/iPod interface.\nThe XLE Touring adds foglights, driver memory settings, blind  spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and Entune Premium Audio with  Navigation and App Suite, which includes a 7-inch touchscreen display, nine  speakers, a navigation system and smartphone app integration.\nThe Limited includes all the above plus xenon headlights,  auto-dimming side mirrors, automatic wipers, upgraded leather upholstery, a  10-way power driver seat, an eight-way power passenger seat, ventilated front  seats, heated rear seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, a rear power  sunshade, ambient lighting, Toyota's Safety Connect system and an 11-speaker  JBL premium sound system. The Limited also offers an optional Technology  package with adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlight control, Qi  wireless charging and a forward collision warning system.",

    "full_description": "Plug-in  hybrids have all of the advantages of standard hybrids as well as some EV  perks. They're an especially great alternative for those with commute distances  that fall within the EV range.  \nIn  the case of the 2019 Toyota Prius Prime, that range is 25 miles. If you're  fortunate enough to have a short commute and you buy a Prius Prime, it's  possible that stopping to get gasoline could be a rare occasion. Once that  range is depleted, you'll still have the hybrid powertrain to keep you going,  and the Prime's 54-mpg combined fuel economy estimate is impressive by itself.\nThere  is a trade-off, though. Compared to the standard Prius, the supplemental  batteries reduce seating capacity to four, the added weight further dulls  overall performance and there's less cargo space. On the plus side, we like the  Prime's styling better than that of the regular Prius and compared to other  plug-ins, it's a bit more affordable.\nThe  2019 Toyota Prius Prime is a solid plug-in hybrid choice, but there are some  rivals we consider better. Most notably is the Chevrolet Volt that has double  the EV range, but you'll have to act fast if you want one since Chevy just  discontinued it. All that's left is dealer stock. We also suggest checking out  the Honda Clarity Plug-In that delivers a lot for the money. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2017 Toyota Prius Prime (1.8L inline-4  hybrid | CVT automatic | FWD). The electric powertrain has sufficient punch for city driving, but don't think you can rely on it with confidence when merging onto the freeway or pulling out to pass. You'll be using a lot of the engine's power for any real acceleration. Our 0-60 mph test run took 10 seconds, which is pretty slow. There's a decent amount of braking power for routine use. But stops can be hard to judge because there's not much feel and the brakes can get grabby, especially in harder applications. Our emergency-panic stop from 60 mph used up 119 feet, and the car tended to wiggle a bit as it came to a halt. While the vehicle goes where you point it, the steering feels light and numb when cruising straight on the highway, and effort doesn't change much as you round corners. It improves somewhat if you decide to push it on a winding road. But in routine use, the Prime doesn't feel all that connected. The Prime's enlarged plug-in battery represents extra weight that sits somewhat high behind the rear wheels, which throws off the balance markedly compared to a regular Prius. It feels heavy, and the soft springs and sluggish damping feel inadequate, most notably when corners come one after another. The theme is efficiency, so unless you're using big gas pedal inputs, the Prime responds sluggishly. Driving up big hills highlights the lack of power and the vocal gas engine, but downhills are an opportunity to recharge the battery. The Prime loves the city, and it responds well to stop-and-go. The seats are ergonomically well-designed. They're not couch-soft but have that initial give that lets them conform to your body. The seat bottom is short, but we had no issues on a long drive. The rear seats are similar to the fronts but with broader seatbacks. They're also properly comfortable. The Prime's ride is generally flat, and it does not float or wallow. Its suspension handles small, rolling-type bumps quite well, but the suspension and tires tend to transmit harsh square-edge bumps directly into the cabin, especially if they come one after another. Obviously, it's quiet in EV mode. But the gas engine is annoyingly noisy when you've got the pedal pinned. There's some wind and road noise, both of which become noticeable mainly when the engine is off at near-highway speeds in EV mode. The Prius has an effective automatic climate control system, but on the Premium and the Advanced only the temperature and defroster have physical buttons. Everything else is on the touchscreen. The Plus uses an easier system. The unique Eco mode has the ability to focus cooling solely on the driver. We've never liked the Prius' central dash, and the Prime Advanced (and Premium) also has a huge touchscreen with layered menus for many functions. Volume is on the passenger side, and a passenger must reach to the driver's side to adjust the temperature. All of this is far easier on the base Plus model. Easy for people to slip in and out thanks to large door openings and narrow sills. Rear-seat denizens benefit from seatbacks that are nearly flush with the body structure \u2014 no need to scoot forward to exit. But taller rear occupants may have to duck on the way in because the roof slopes down. The seats are nicely adjustable for routine use, but they lack the bolstering necessary to hold the driver in place for sporty driving. But we're more concerned about the insufficient steering-wheel telescoping range. The wheel doesn't pull back far enough for taller drivers. There's ample room for 6-footers to occupy the front and rear rows at the same time, although wider passengers may feel as if they're sitting close to the doors. The rear seats have generous toe space. But the overall feeling of roominess is lessened a bit by the bulbous dash and bulky center console. The low cowl and sloping hood provide a generous view, but it is hard to locate the corners when parking nose-in. The split rear window can be distracting, and cargo can easily obstruct the view. The thick roof pillars create big rear blind spots. You will rely on the camera system and parking sensors. The Prime uses a mix of metal and composites to minimize weight, but the results don't feel cheap or poorly made. It features tight panel gaps, and all the interior pieces feel connected and solid. But certain glossy plastic accent pieces may not agree with everyone. There's ample space for your odds and ends. The standard smartphone charging tray is large and functional, and it's handy even if you don't use it for charging. It has a deep center console that can swallow an SLR camera with a lens and door pockets that can hold medium-size water bottles. The large battery pack takes a big bite out of cargo capacity because it raises the floor considerably. Something as routine as a grocery bag will be too tall to fit under the security cover and will obstruct visibility through the rear window. The lower LATCH points are easily accessed underneath a flap of seat fabric, while the top tethers are a little harder to get to. The large rear door openings are convenient, but the low roofline toward the rear of the door may make accessing rear-facing seats harder. The audio interface is fairly easy to use, and the JBL sound system is adequate. The touch-panel volume adjuster is atrocious; use the steering controls instead. The navigation system is excessively restrictive about what you can do while in motion, and its fonts and graphic design are old. It has Bluetooth streaming audio, a cover art display, and a USB jack for iPhones and Android devices. But Toyota does not support the newer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto interfaces, preferring instead to use its own proprietary Entune system, which isn't nearly as intuitive. The Prime has effective blind-spot monitoring, lane departure warning and rear cross-traffic alert systems. It's also equipped with adaptive cruise control, but it turns off automatically as the car slows down past 23 mph with just two subtle beeps. Use it only for highway cruising. The Prime's voice control system is slow, but ultimately it's easy to use if you take the time to let it learn your voice. Once you know what words and phrases to use for each function, it can be very accurate for navigation, entertainment and even climate settings. The Premium trim level hits the sweet spot in the Prius Prime lineup since all models have  the same EV range and fuel economy estimates. Among the features we like, the  Premium trim gets the large 11.6-inch touchscreen, a power driver's seat,  simulated leather seats, enhanced keyless entry and a wireless charging pad. \nAll  Prius Primes have a  1.8-liter four-cylinder engine paired to a plug-in hybrid system. Total  system output is 121 horsepower,  delivered to the front wheels through a specialized continuously variable  automatic transmission. The EPA estimates the Prime can drive up to 25 miles  using pure electric power. Fully charging the battery takes 5.5 hours using a  120-volt power source or a little more than two hours with 240 volts.\nThe Plus trim level starts you out with 15-inch wheels, LED headlights,  automatic climate control, keyless access (driver's door only) and start,  heated front seats, a 7-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, a USB port, and a  six-speaker sound system with satellite radio. A suite of driver safety aids,  called Toyota Safety Sense P, is also standard and includes adaptive cruise  control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane  departure warning and lane keeping assist, and automatic high beams.\nStepping  up one rung to the Premium trim  level puts you into the Prius Prime's sweet spot. It includes a power driver's seat, an 11.6-inch  central touchscreen and upgraded infotainment system, simulated leather  (SofTex) upholstery, keyless entry on the other three doors, and wireless  smartphone charging.\nThe Advanced trim level adds on a premium audio system, blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, a heated steering wheel, an  auto-dimming mirror, a head-up display, a smartphone app with a charge  management system and remote-control climate operation, automatic wipers, and a  semi-automated parking function.",

    "full_description": "Apart from the debut of a new trim level \u2013 the Persona Series Special Edition \u2013 the Toyota Prius stands pat for 2013. The 2013 Toyota Prius continues to be the quintessential hybrid, though other newer hybrids are more desirable to drive. If we played a little word association with the general  public, we're pretty certain it would go something like this: Copier: \"Xerox\";  Tissues: \"Kleenex\"; Hybrid: \"Prius.\" These are all brands  that have dominated their respective markets so greatly that their names have  become the de facto way of referring to the product itself. The 2013 Toyota  Prius continues that trend, though we would say hybrid shoppers enjoy a wider  range of appealing choices than ever before.\nCertainly, there are many reasons behind this Toyota's popularity.  First and foremost is its incredible fuel efficiency -- the Prius' EPA combined  rating of 50 mpg is topped only by the smaller Prius C and much more expensive  plug-in hybrids such as the Chevrolet Volt. Yet it's also a pretty nice car to  drive. The Prius' hatchback body style provides generous passenger and cargo  space, and if luxury is your thing, Toyota's got you covered with a plethora of  high-end options. Given all that plus its strong reliability record, it's no  wonder that the Prius is used as a taxi in many cities.\nBut it's not all green lights for this green car pioneer. The  materials quality within that roomy cabin is mediocre in places, and the  driving position can be awkward for many people. While the Prius still easily  outclasses its chief rival, the Honda Insight, it's a harder sell against the new  2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid, which is nicer inside and more refined to drive.  The latest hybrid midsize sedans, including the 2013 Ford  Fusion Hybrid and Toyota Camry Hybrid,  are also impressively good.\nAnd then there is the price of going hybrid to consider.  Today's standard compact cars (either gasoline- or diesel-powered) get  excellent fuel economy while costing much less, meaning the Prius might not produce  the savings in fuel costs that you think it will. Still, the 2013 Toyota Prius  continues to validate its position as the quintessential hybrid. Its blend of  fuel efficiency, practicality and handy high-tech features make it an easy  choice in its segment. The 2013 Toyota Prius is powered by a 1.8-liter  four-cylinder engine combined with a pair of electric motor/generators.  Together they send a total output of 134 horsepower through a specialized  continuously variable transmission (CVT).\nIn track testing, we clocked the Prius from zero to 60 mph  in 10.1 seconds; that's about the same as the Insight, but slower than the  C-Max Hybrid and other hybrid midsize sedans. The EPA estimates the 2013 Prius  will return a very impressive 51 mpg city/48 highway and 50 mpg combined. In  real-world testing, we found these estimates to be reasonably accurate. Every 2013 Toyota Prius comes standard with antilock disc  brakes, stability and traction control, front side airbags, side curtain  airbags and a driver knee airbag. The Prius Four and Five can be equipped with  Toyota's Safety Connect emergency communications system. The Prius Five  includes a pre-collision warning system and a lane-departure warning system.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the Prius came to a stop from 60  mph in 118 feet -- very good for a compact or midsize car.\nIn government crash tests, the Prius received a perfect five  stars for overall protection, with four stars for overall frontal protection  and five stars for overall side protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway  Safety gave the Prius the highest possible rating of \"Good\" in its  frontal-offset, side and roof strength tests. Acceleration in the 2013 Toyota Prius is far from sprightly,  but it'll likely be adequate for most buyers. Four driving modes -- Normal,  Eco, Power and EV -- allow the driver to choose the optimum powertrain  configuration depending on conditions. Eco is measured and sluggish, but  returns the best fuel economy. Power is useful for entering freeways or driving  on hills. EV mode locks out the gasoline engine, but only allows a maximum  speed of 25 mph and requires at least a half-charged battery pack.\nAround town, the Prius is an easy-to-drive runabout. The  electric steering doesn't provide much feedback, but it's very light in parking  lots and doesn't become overly boosted on the highway. The ride is comfortable,  but nastier bumps can leave it a bit flummoxed. There is also an excessive  amount of road noise that permeates the cabin regardless of speed, and the  noises emitted by its smaller gasoline engine are hardly what we'd describe as sonorous. The 2013 Toyota Prius features straightforward controls that  jut out toward the driver in a \"floating console\" that provides a  storage tray underneath. It's a nice design that helps maximize cabin space.  The standard touchscreen operates many of the Prius' high-tech features and is,  for the most part, smartly designed. The digital instrument panel also features  a floating layer that displays audio, temperature and trip computer information  when the driver touches those controls on the steering wheel, minimizing eye  movement. Some drivers might find the overall design a bit too busy-looking,  however.\nMaterials quality in the Prius is disappointing, with harder  and cheaper plastics than other cars in its price range. The corduroy-like  texturing on the climate and audio controls seems nice at first, but collects  oil from the skin and causes circular dark spots on most buttons.\nIn terms of versatility, though, the Prius is still a champ.  The hatchback body style provides more cargo capacity than a typical midsize  sedan, and the backseat offers plenty of space. Sadly, taller drivers still  have to contend with a steering wheel that's placed too far away. There's a  telescoping column, but it doesn't come out nearly far enough. \nStandard equipment on the Prius Two includes 15-inch alloy  wheels, heated power mirrors, a rear window wiper, keyless ignition/entry,  cruise control, automatic climate control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, a height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split-folding rear seat, an  advanced trip computer, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a touchscreen  electronics interface and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, an  auxiliary audio jack and an iPod/USB audio interface.\nThe Prius Three gains an enhanced keyless entry system, a  rearview camera, a navigation system, voice controls, satellite radio, HD radio  and Toyota's Entune system, which includes real-time information (traffic,  weather, fuel prices, sports scores) and a suite of apps that connect the car  to Internet sites like Pandora, iHeart Radio and Open Table through your  smartphone.\nThe Prius Persona Special Edition is similar to the Three  but includes 17-inch alloy wheels, charcoal/black \"SofTex\" (synthetic  leather) upholstery with red stitching and dark chrome interior accents.\nStepping up to the Prius Four reverts back to 15-inch wheels  but gets you automatic headlights, an eight-way power driver seat, heated front  seats, SofTex upholstery, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and a JBL sound  system with eight GreenEdge speakers. The Prius Five features 17-inch alloy  wheels, foglamps and LED headlamps with auto level control and washers.\nAn optional Solar Roof package for the Prius Three adds a  sunroof and a solar-powered ventilation system that keeps the car cool to limit  the burden on the air-conditioning system. It's also offered for the Four, and  then includes a head-up display, Safety Connect emergency communications and an  upgraded navigation system with a high-definition display and split-screen  capability.\nThe Five's Advanced Technology package adds adaptive cruise  control, a pre-collision alert system, a lane-departure warning system, Safety  Connect, a head-up display and the higher-quality navigation display.\nAvailable on all trims is the Plus Appearance package, which  adds unique 17-inch alloy wheels and a seven-piece aerodynamic body kit. To  this the Plus Performance package (availability depends on trim level) adds a  sport-tuned suspension and unique badging.",

    "full_description": "After a major redesign last year, there are no significant changes for the 2011 Toyota Prius. There are plenty of choices for a green car this year. But when it comes to high fuel economy, plenty of versatility and a reasonable price, the 2011 Toyota Prius cannot be beat. You could be forgiven for thinking the 2011 Toyota Prius has  a big target painted on its side. After all, people like to gun for you when  you're on top, and the Prius has been the king of the green car sales charts  for years now. This year, in particular, there are many new choices for a fuel-efficient  car. The question then becomes: Can the Prius keep its mojo going?\nThe good news for Toyota is that the Prius itself is better  than ever. Last year, Toyota engineers reduced the car's aerodynamic drag, and  the overall look is now sleeker and sportier. Under the hood, a larger gas  engine and stronger electric motor combine for more power and better fuel  economy -- the Prius has a combined EPA fuel economy estimate of 50 mpg, the  best of any conventional hybrid vehicle. The newest Prius also has revised  suspension tuning and improved electric steering to help make it more agile  than before.\nThe 2011 Prius can also seemingly transform from a versatile  utility hatchback to a small, hyper-efficient luxury sedan depending on how you  equip it. On the higher trim levels, you'll find high-end appointments like  heated leather seats, a solar-powered sunroof (it ventilates the interior when  parked), a navigation system, adaptive cruise control (it matches your speed to  the car ahead), a pre-collision system (tightens seatbelts and applies the  brakes if a crash is unavoidable) and a lane-departure warning system. There's  even an automated parallel-parking system to help you squeeze into tight  downtown parking spaces. \nThere are some downsides to this latest Prius, however. Most  concern the interior, such as too many cheap-feeling plastics, an awkward  driving position and the lack of an iPod adapter on most models. If these  attributes bother you, you'll certainly want to look around. Honda's Insight,  also new last year, is the Prius' most direct competitor. It's less expensive  and drives a bit more like a regular car, but it's not as fuel-efficient, it has  a smaller backseat and it can seem too noisy and budget-oriented.\nYou might also check some of the top hybrid sedans, with the 2011 Ford Fusion  Hybrid being our favorite. It doesn't have the top fuel economy of the  Prius, but it looks like a normal sedan and drives with more vigor. The all-new 2011 Hyundai Sonata  Hybrid and Kia Optima Hybrid are also worth looking at.\nThen there are the two hyped green cars this year, the 2011 Chevrolet Volt and 2011 Nissan Leaf. The Leaf  is 100-percent electrically powered, but its limited range and charging options  mean it will be a niche choice. The Volt is probably more appealing -- it's  basically a plug-in hybrid, giving it theoretically way better fuel economy  than the Prius -- but it's also considerably more expensive. Toyota is also set  to offer a plug-in version of the Prius to counter the Volt.\nIn sum, we think the 2011 Prius deserves to keep its status  as the best all-around hybrid. With strong fuel economy, hatchback utility, a  reasonable price and a feature list that can range from economy to luxury, the  Prius earns its painted bulls-eye. The 2011 Toyota Prius is powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine combined with a pair of electric motor/generators; they send their power through a specialized continuously variable transmission (CVT). The result is total output of 134 horsepower.\nIn track testing, we clocked the Prius from zero to 60 mph in 10.1 seconds, which is about average for a hybrid vehicle. The most important number, however, is fuel economy. The EPA estimates the 2011 Prius will return a very impressive 51 mpg city/48 highway and 50 mpg combined. Every 2011 Toyota Prius comes standard with antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front side airbags, side curtain airbags and a driver knee airbag. Optional equipment includes a pre-collision warning system and a lane-departure warning system. In brake testing, the Prius stopped from 60 mph in a short 118 feet.\nThe Prius has not yet been rated using the government's new, more strenuous 2011 crash tests. According to 2010 ratings (which aren't comparable to 2011 ratings) the Toyota Prius earned four stars rating in frontal impact protection for both driver and passenger. In side impact testing, the Prius scored five stars for front passengers and four stars for the rear. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Prius the highest rating of \"Good\" in frontal offset and side-impact crashes. The 2011 Toyota Prius features a hyper-quiet cabin, made possible by its part-time electric motivation and extensive use of sound-deadening materials. The ride is also quite comfortable. The electric steering doesn't provide much in the way of feel, but it's user-friendly in parking lots and doesn't become overly boosted on the highway.\nAcceleration is far from sprightly, but it's on par for a hybrid and certainly adequate for most drivers. Four driving modes -- Normal, Eco, Power and EV -- allow the pilot to decide the optimum powertrain configuration depending on conditions. Eco is measured and sluggish, but returns the best fuel economy. Power is useful for entering freeways or driving on hills. EV mode locks out the gasoline engine, but only up to 25 mph with at least a half-charged battery pack. The 2011 Prius features straightforward climate and audio controls that jut out toward the driver in a \"floating console\" that provides a storage tray underneath. It's a nice design that helps maximize cabin space. The digital instrument panel also features a floating layer that displays audio, temperature and trip computer information when the driver touches those controls on the steering wheel, minimizing eye movement. Some drivers might find the overall design a bit too busy-looking, however.\nMaterials quality in the Prius is disappointing, with harder and cheaper plastics than other cars in its price range. The corduroy-like texturing on the climate and audio controls seems nice at first, but collects oil from the skin and causes circular dark spots on most buttons. \nIn terms of versatility, though, the Prius is still a champ. The hatchback body style provides more cargo capacity than a typical midsize sedan, and the backseat offers plenty of space. Sadly, taller drivers still have to contend with a steering wheel that's placed too far away. There's a telescoping column, but it doesn't come out nearly far enough. \nThe Prius Three adds Bluetooth and an eight-speaker JBL upgraded stereo with six-CD changer. Prius Four includes this equipment as well as exterior locking buttons for keyless entry, leather upholstery, heated front seats, driver lumbar adjustment and an auto-dimming mirror. The loaded Prius Five comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, foglamps and LED headlamps with auto-leveling and washers.\nThe Navigation package, available on all but the Prius One and Two, includes a voice-activated touchscreen navigation system with real-time traffic, a rearview camera, a four-CD changer (replacing the six-slot), an iPod/USB audio interface and Bluetooth music streaming. The Solar Roof package can be added to the Navigation package and includes a sunroof with a solar-powered ventilation system that cools the car when parked, and remote-activated air-conditioning for cooling the cabin before you enter.\nThe Advanced Technology package available for Prius V includes all components of the Navigation package plus adaptive cruise control, pre-collision alert system, a lane departure warning system and automated self-parking.",

    "full_description": "Largely unchanged, the 2016 Toyota Corolla gets updated Entune audio systems and an S Special Edition variant with a number of minor cosmetic upgrades. If you're looking for a small sedan that competently covers all the basics, the 2016 Toyota Corolla may be just right for you. We've found it doesn't inspire much excitement, but its sensible blend of fuel economy and value are definitely appealing. Take a closer look at the newest Toyota Corolla. The Toyota Corolla gets little respect from most car  reviewers. It's a soulless appliance, they'll tell you; where's the excitement  and flair? But the Corolla is now in its 11th generation. It's been on the  market nonstop for almost half a century and ranks as the world's best-selling  small sedan. Toyota seems to know more than  it gets credit for about its customers and their taste in cars, and the 2016  Corolla is bound to be yet another crowd-pleasing choice.\n\nThe 2016 Corolla is the  latest in a line of top-selling small Toyota sedans first introduced in the  U.S. in 1968.\nMany of the current Corolla's strengths can be found inside.  The overall design is fresh and brings, dare we say it, a stylish edge to the  traditionally staid small sedan class. The interface for the infotainment  system is easy to use thanks to clear displays and well-placed controls. We  also like the Corolla's rear seat that provides more legroom than many midsize  sedans. Add the Corolla's laudable crash-test scores, high fuel economy and exceptionally  high resale value and you have all the ingredients for a car that pleases more  than it dismays.\nJust keep in mind that if you value driver engagement, those  reviewers are right -- the Corolla is hardly inspiring from behind the wheel.  More dynamic alternatives include the sophisticated and similarly  fuel-efficient Mazda 3 and  the frugal yet fun-to-drive Ford  Focus. Although the Hyundai  Elantra isn't that sporty, it offers ample style at an attractive price,  and the always-popular Honda Civic and Volkswagen Jetta have been remade into  strong all-around contenders. But the Toyota still earns a solid Edmunds  \"B\" rating. Other small cars may steal the headlines, but don't  let that distract you from the 2016 Corolla's fundamental competence. The 2016 Toyota Corolla is powered by a 1.8-liter  four-cylinder engine that comes in two versions. On every trim level except the  LE Eco, it produces 132 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque. The LE Eco's  engine is a more efficient version with Toyota's Valvematic variable value  timing and also makes a little more power, checking in at 140 hp and 126 lb-ft  of torque.\nThe base Corolla L comes standard with a six-speed manual  transmission, offering a four-speed automatic as an option. The other trims  feature a continuously variable transmission (CVT), although the S Plus can  also be ordered with the six-speed manual.\nIn Edmunds performance testing, a Corolla LE Eco sauntered  to 60 mph in 9.2 seconds, comparable to a CVT-equipped Honda Civic but nearly a  full second behind the Mazda 3.\nEPA-estimated  fuel economy varies depending on which Corolla you choose. It checks in at 31 mpg combined (27 city/36 highway) with the four-speed automatic and also 31 mpg combined (28/37) with the six-speed manual. The CVT returns 32 mpg combined (29/38) in the LE and a comparable 32 mpg combined (29/37) in the S. The LE Eco leads the way at 35 mpg combined (30/42) in standard form and 34 mpg combined (30/40) in Plus or Premium trim. All 2016 Toyota Corollas come standard with stability and traction  control and antilock brakes with brake assist. Also standard are front side  airbags, front and rear side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag and a  passenger seat cushion airbag. A rearview camera is standard on all trims  except the L. Missing, however, are some of the latest accident avoidance  features that are increasingly common for small sedans, such as blind-spot  monitoring.\nNote that most 2016 Corollas get rear drum brakes, with only  the S Plus, S Special Edition and S Premium trims upgrading to rear discs. In  Edmunds brake testing, a Corolla LE Eco with the rear drums stopped from 60 mph  in 130 feet, a longer-than-average result.\nIn government crash testing, the Corolla earned the top  overall rating  of five stars, including five stars for frontal impacts and five stars for  side impacts. The independent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded  the Corolla its top  rating of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset,  side-impact and roof-strength tests. In the small-overlap frontal-offset test,  though, the Corolla received the Institute's second-lowest rating of \"Marginal.\"  It also received a \"Marginal\" rating for ease-of-use of the child  seat anchor system. Its seat and head restraint design was rated \"Good\"  for whiplash protection in rear impacts. The 2016 Toyota Corolla delivers much the same driving  experience as its predecessor. Partly, that's down to Toyota's tried-and-true  but generally underwhelming 1.8-liter engine. Acceleration is adequate but  nothing more. The LE Eco's version gets some tweaks that add a few horsepower,  but not enough to make a real difference. We do like the CVT, which has  computer-simulated \"shifts\" to mitigate the typical CVT's  constant-rpm drone during acceleration. Skip the archaic four-speed automatic  in the base L unless the price is simply too good to pass up.\n\nWhile it's no road rocket,  the 2016 Corolla is a top choice of drivers seeking cars that guarantee  comfortable commuting.\nThe Corolla's handling, too, is familiar. Sporty S-trim  touches notwithstanding, there's no playfulness to be found here; instead, attempts  at enthusiastic driving in the twisties is met with lifeless steering and  pronounced body roll. On the plus side, this is a car that's all about  no-hassle commuting comfort, with a quiet, compliant ride. If that describes  your daily driving needs, the 2016 Corolla can make the daily grind seem less  onerous. The Corolla's cabin is easily the most interesting one to  date. It's clear that designers were given freer rein this time, and the result  is a reasonably stylish dashboard, accented by un-Corolla-like flourishes such  as a sportily contoured steering wheel and an eye-catching asymmetrical shifter  surround. The top priority remains ease of use, so the various audio interfaces  employ tried-and-true knobs for volume and tuning, while the LE-and-up  automatic climate control system (a welcome luxury in this price bracket) provides  a large knob and a few foolproof buttons.\n\nThe 2016 Corolla's  interior is the most stylish yet, with controls that are both easy to use and  easy to access.\nAnother pleasant surprise is the standard 6.1-inch  touchscreen interface, which provides large virtual buttons and simple, clear  graphics. The screen responds quickly to inputs, and its feature set is  generous for an economy car offering. The available Entune App Suite integrates  smartphone-connected services from Bing, Facebook, Yelp and Pandora, among  others, as well as real-time traffic data and sports and stock information.  Note that getting started with Entune App Suite requires you to install an app  on your phone and register for an account.\nThe Corolla's front seats provide generally adequate  comfort, particularly the S trims' better-bolstered chairs, though some may  wish for more lumbar support. Also, longer-legged drivers could use more range  from the telescoping steering wheel. Thanks in part to a 3.9-inch-longer  wheelbase than the previous-generation Corolla, the current car offers  considerably more rear legroom than most small sedans, if not a commensurate  amount of headroom. The middle rear position is made more hospitable by the  nearly flat floor, which lacks the traditional center \"hump.\" Trunk  capacity is average at 13 cubic feet, but the wide trunk opening facilitates  loading and unloading. \nStandard features on the base L model include 15-inch steel  wheels, LED low-beam headlights with halogen high beams, LED running lights,  powered accessories, air-conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel  with auxiliary controls, a six-way adjustable driver seat and four-way front  passenger seat, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, Bluetooth connectivity and an Entune audio system with 6.1-inch  touchscreen, voice controls, six speakers, a CD player, a USB port, an auxiliary  audio jack and, for iPhone users, the Siri Eyes Free voice control system.\nThe LE adds 16-inch steel wheels, heated mirrors, variable  intermittent wipers, keyless entry, metallic cabin accents, cruise control,  automatic climate control and a rearview camera. It is eligible for the Entune Plus audio system option, which  adds satellite and HD radio and the Scout GPS Link app that displays smartphone navigation on the Corolla's central touchscreen. \nThe LE Plus adds 16-inch alloy wheels, foglights and  eligibility for both an optional sunroof and the Driver Convenience package,  which includes the sunroof and adds keyless entry and ignition, a roof-mounted  antenna (versus the standard in-glass antenna) and the Entune Premium audio  system with an integrated navigation system and Entune App Suite mobile-app integration.\nGoing with the LE Premium gets you the LE Plus model's  standard and optional features plus an eight-way power driver seat, heated  front seats and Toyota's SofTex premium vinyl upholstery.\nThe LE Eco starts with the LE's features and adds  efficiency-maximizing engine and transmission tuning, 15-inch steel wheels with  low-rolling-resistance tires, a rear spoiler and enhanced aerodynamics. The LE  Eco Plus gets the LE Plus features and adds special 16-inch alloy wheels,  chrome window trim, an Eco driving mode and the same options as the LE Plus.  The LE Eco Premium shares the LE Premium's upgrades.\nThe sport-themed S trim gets you the LE's features plus  unique wheel covers, a chrome grille frame, color-keyed mirrors with signal  repeaters, a rear spoiler, a chrome exhaust tip, sport front seats, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel with paddle shifters, a Sport driving mode for  the CVT, sport instrumentation and a trip computer.\nThe S Plus upgrade provides 17-inch  alloy wheels, firmer suspension tuning, rear disc brakes (versus the standard  drums) and eligibility for the sunroof and Driver Convenience package. There's  also a six-speed manual transmission version of the S Plus that loses the  paddle shifters (duh) but gets the Driver Convenience package as standard. The  S Premium starts with the S Plus equipment and shares the upgrades of the other  Premium models. \nA limited-production S Special  Edition, marking the Corolla's 50th anniversary, starts with the standard  equipment of the S Plus with the CVT and adds 17-inch alloys with a special  gloss black finish, Special Edition badging, keyless entry and ignition and an  all-black interior with red contrast stitching and red accents on the  instrument panel. Despite its sporty theme, it won't be available with a manual  transmission. The sunroof and Entune Premium audio are stand-alone options on  the S Special Edition.",

    "full_description": "A relic of a bygone era, the 2021 Toyota 4Runner is definitely not your typical  crossover SUV. Indeed, with its high stance and big-shouldered styling, the  4Runner looks like Bill and Ted time-warped it in from the 1980s. Yet this  classic style is undoubtedly a big part of the 4Runner's appeal. Toyota  last redesigned the current-generation 4Runner back in 2010, which in  automotive terms might as well be the '80s. This is a truck-based SUV that  makes only slight concessions to the latest market trends. You've dialed up the  wrong SUV if you want great fuel economy, a comfy ride and a tech interface  that orders you a pizza while it parallel parks itself. But it does give you  rugged off-road ability, plenty of towing capacity and a versatile cargo area.Changes  are slight for 2021. There's a new Trail Special Edition that comes with a  Yakima roof rack and a custom 40-quart beverage cooler. The top TRD Pro trim  gets new, stronger wheels and Fox shock absorbers retuned to improve off-road  performance. Is this the right SUV for you? Check out our Expert Review to get  our in-depth take on the 2021 4Runner. You  buy a 4Runner for its off-road capability, or at least you should. As such, we  say go with the Venture Special Edition.  It has the same features as the TRD Off-Road that help with off-road  performance but stands out a little more with its gray-painted wheels and  overlanding-style roof rack. How does the 4Runner drive? The 4Runner's performance is adequate. It's not terribly fast, but the engine and transmission are smooth. It can hold its own in traffic. The brakes are a bit jumpy, and there's some nosedive when you really mash the brake pedal, but you'll get used to it. Around corners, the 4Runner turns in quickly and provides a pleasing amount of stability for a truck-based SUV. Even so, other car-like crossover SUVs are more nimble.    The 4Runner becomes a superstar if you're the sort who would take it off-road for exploring or adventure camping. Its multimode 4WD system, high ground clearance and special TRD features make it capable of taking on rocky trails. If that's important to you, then the 4Runner's otherwise mediocre performance will be more or less insignificant. How comfortable is the 4Runner? You wouldn't be far off the mark if you sized up the 4Runner's comfort potential just by looking at it. You actually can judge this book by its cover. Its truck-based construction results in a somewhat bouncy and stiff ride. It's not terrible, but just about any other crossover SUV rides more smoothly.    The same goes for wind noise as the 4Runner's boxy shape stirs up more than the generally sleeker and more low-slung competition. Interestingly, road noise from the tires is relatively tame because body-on-frame construction provides an extra layer of sound suppression between road and cabin. How\u2019s the interior? Living with a 4Runner is a pretty pleasant experience, but it has one fairly obvious drawback: its tall ride height. That makes getting in and out somewhat difficult, though side steps are available to help out. It's really no worse than any full-size pickup in this regard, but other crossover SUVs are easier to access.    Once you're inside, you'll find easy-to-understand controls and a highly adjustable driving position that affords a commanding view ahead. There's plenty of space in both the front and back rows. Visibility to the sides and back is surprisingly good because of the 4Runner's squared-off shape and windows. How\u2019s the tech? The 4Runner's touchscreen audio system has clear graphics and numerous fixed shortcut buttons that make it easy to drill down into the menus without staring at the screen as much. It also supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Standard driver aids include traffic-adaptive cruise control and forward collision mitigation. How\u2019s the storage? The 4Runner's squared-off cargo area is big. Fold the rear seats down and you can even roll out sleeping bags back there. Cargo can be accessed by opening the hatch, of course, or by lowering the 4Runner's power rear window.     The roomy second row can accommodate car seats in any of the three positions, even bulkier rear-facing models. The square door openings make for easy access, but little kids will have a hard time climbing up into the cabin. Towing capacity is 5,000 pounds, a useful figure that covers most boats and many small camping trailers. And the vehicle is prewired for not only four-pin but also seven-pin trailer plugs that come on trailers with electric trailer brakes. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The aging 4.0-liter V6 engine and five-speed automatic make for a rather thirsty pairing that does no better than 17 mpg combined (16 city/19 highway). This is, on average, 4 mpg worse than other rival crossover SUVs with all-wheel drive. Is the 4Runner a good value? The 4Runner costs more than some of the crossovers it competes with, but in return you get more in terms of off-highway and towing performance. It also has a strong resale value, so much of the extra you'll pay up front will come back when you move on to something else later on.    While you own it, you'll have two years of free scheduled maintenance for things such as oil changes and tire rotations. The warranty, should you ever need it, is fairly standard. The 4Runner's big downside occurs at the pump, which you will be visiting often because its estimated fuel economy is in the teens in both the city and on the highway. On the road, it's fine. It gets you there. The fun comes in when you take it off-road. As every other SUV has descended into crossover pavement-and-snow mediocrity, the 4Runner still waves the flag for the body-on-frame SUV fans who want real off-road performance.",

    "full_description": "Hey,  the Venza is back! Did you miss it? Considering the lack of shed tears or  internet outcry back when Toyota binned the original Venza after the 2015 model  year, the answer would probably be, \"No, not really.\" But a 2021  Toyota Venza is here nonetheless, and it's got a few new party tricks to show  off. The  new Venza competes with other midsize crossover SUVs such as the Chevrolet  Blazer, Honda Passport, Subaru Outback and Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport. These  models are known for their abundance of passenger and cargo room. Oddly, this  is something the new Venza is a bit short on. However, it does have something  they don't: a standard hybrid powertrain. All  Venzas use a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and two electric motors (one  dedicated to charging) to send power through a continuously variable automatic  transmission to its front wheels. A single rear motor also provides power to  the rear wheels when you need extra traction. It's a similar setup to the RAV4  Hybrid and Highlander Hybrid SUVs. Total output is 219 horsepower. This might  not seem like much given that the Passport's V6 cranks out 280 hp, for example,  but we've found acceleration to be perfectly adequate. Plus, it's smooth, quiet  and gets you a Toyota-estimated 39 mpg in combined city/highway driving. Overall,  we think highly of the Venza and recommend it if you're looking for an SUV  that's stylish, upscale and fuel-efficient. The  Venza's higher starting price means it comes pretty nicely equipped from the  start. Since that's the case, we'd go with the base LE model. It gets you Toyota's full suite of advanced driver aids,  a hands-free liftgate, LED headlights, and keyless entry and ignition. You  won't be able to upgrade to the larger 12.3-inch touchscreen, but we think the  standard 8-inch screen and controls are easier to use anyway. How does the Venza drive? The specs for the Venza's four-cylinder hybrid powertrain don't look like much on paper, but this SUV is adequately quick in real-world acceleration. In Edmunds testing it covered 0-60 mph in 7.6 seconds. That's a second behind the Honda Passport but quicker than a V6 Jeep Grand Cherokee.    The Venza's handling doesn't quite match its sporty looks, but it is tidy and confident as you go around turns. When you're just commuting around town, Toyota's mastery of blending gas and electric power shows through and the Venza delivers smooth and virtually lag-free acceleration. How comfortable is the Venza? Toyota paid special attention to dialing up the comfort level in the Venza. The cabin is well insulated from the sounds of the outside environment, and the engine doesn't have the same annoying drone as it does in the RAV4 Hybrid. The Venza also delivers excellent ride comfort, feeling more like a Lexus in the way it dispatches bumps and handles highway dips.    The front seats are both comfortable and supportive. Our Limited trim test vehicle featured front seats with heat and ventilation, but we didn't find the seat ventilation to be all that effective. Thankfully, the dual-zone climate control provides more than adequate cooling. Rear passengers have pretty comfortable seats as well, with reclining seatbacks and climate control vents to ensure good air flow. How\u2019s the interior? We consider the Venza a rival to other midsize SUVs such as the Honda Passport and Subaru Outback. However, it has less interior space than those vehicles and generally matches the RAV4, which is a class size smaller. This isn't to say it's cramped inside; it's just that it's not as roomy as other SUVs in the same price range.    The rest of the interior is quite good. Toyota's latest (optional) 12.3-inch infotainment screen offers a user-friendly interface and menu structure. Below this screen are upgraded touch-sensitive controls for the climate control and radio. They work OK and are responsive, but we'd still prefer standard push buttons and knobs.    The Venza's sleek body is relatively easy to climb in and out of and offers excellent forward visibility. The thick rear roof pillars obscure some of the natural view over your shoulder, but blind-spot monitoring is standard to help you out while changing lanes. Our Limited trim came with a 360-degree parking camera system that takes much of the guesswork out of maneuvering in tight spaces. How\u2019s the tech? Toyota has finally caught up with the industry on smartphone integration, offering Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard features in the Venza. The projection of your phone's apps doesn't use up all of the space on the optional 12.3-inch touchscreen, but it spans a good amount and leaves room for additional on-screen controls. The native navigation system isn't as elegant, quick or easy as phone-based navigation apps, but it's nice to have in case you don't have a cell signal. Four USB ports plus a wireless charger provide power on the go for all devices on board.    Toyota has also come a long way with its advanced driver aids, and many come as standard equipment. Adaptive cruise control works down to a full stop, and lane-centering assist keeps you in bounds without ping-ponging off lane markers. It's one of the more comprehensive and well-executed systems in the segment.    And we'd be remiss if we didn't mention the Venza's optional tint-on-demand electrochromic panoramic sunroof. With the push of a button, you can switch from clear glass to opaque white. It effectively blocks out much of the direct sun and heat but maintains a bright cabin space. How\u2019s the storage? Size matters when it comes to storage, and the Venza is smaller than most in the class. The cargo area is usable and doesn't look that small in isolation, but at 28.8 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats, it trails the class by a good margin (even the RAV4 offers more space) and has a slightly awkward liftover height. The 60/40-split seats fold flat, and you can store the cargo cover under the load floor when it's not in use. A hands-free tailgate is standard, something some competitors only offer on top-trim models.    Cabin storage for small items is also limited. Most bins are smaller than those you'll find in the average midsize crossover, and the Venza even lacks overhead space for sunglasses. For those with child seat needs, things are considerably better. Anchors are easy to access and we didn't have any issues installing a large rear-facing infant seat. But drivers over 6 feet will likely need to locate the seat on the passenger side.     It should also be noted that the Venza has not been rated for towing. How\u2019s the fuel economy? Preliminary fuel economy estimates are 39 mpg (40 city, 37 highway). However, we observed an impressive 44.3 mpg when driving our 115-mile real-world evaluation route. Granted the Venza only comes as a hybrid, but it obliterates everything in the segment in efficiency. The next most efficient SUV is the Subaru Outback (which is considerably slower) at 29 mpg combined. If our result is an accurate representation, we expect the Venza to routinely match or exceed its economy estimates. Is the Venza a good value? While the Venza's cost of entry is higher than most in this segment, it has the interior quality and exterior styling of a Lexus. You won't be able to get into a Venza for less than $33,000, but it does come with a significant number of standard features such as a full suite of advanced driving aids, LED headlights and taillights, and a hands-free liftgate. The fully loaded Limited trim is competitively priced with segment leaders too.    Additional benefits for the Venza beyond Toyota's basic three-year/36,000-mile warranty include lengthier hybrid powertrain coverage for eight years/100,000 miles. Toyota also recently extended its battery warranty coverage to 10 years/150,000 miles. Free scheduled maintenance is included for the first two years/25,000 miles, and there's roadside assistance for the first two years of ownership. The Venza has returned with a healthy amount of personality. It's destined to be more popular than its predecessor just based on its aggressive new design alone. But that sportier look isn't backed up by athletic performance. Sure, it's adequately quick and very fuel-efficient, but it's not the weekend-joyride type unless the point is seeing how far you can get on a tank of gas.    But, if like us you value substance, then the Venza excels in almost all the important areas for this midsize SUV class and rewards you with a well-rounded driving experience.",

    "full_description": "New for 2017 is a standard suite of safety systems that Toyota calls Safety Sense. Included are a forward collision warning system, lane departure warning and intervention, automatic high-beam control and adaptive cruise control. There aren't many choices if you want to buy a  compact crossover segment and achieve remarkable fuel economy. Before 2016, the  Subaru XV Crosstrek Hybrid was the only hybrid crossover in the game, and we  didn't think its marginal fuel savings were worth the higher price. (Customers  apparently agreed because the Crosstrek Hybrid has been discontinued for 2017.)  Thankfully, last year brought the debut of the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, which  offered significantly higher fuel economy compared to the regular RAV4. We think  the price bump is justified.   If you're worried that this fuel-sipping crossover  won't be able to keep up with traffic, know that those fears will go unfounded.  The RAV4 Hybrid is quicker from 0 to 60 mph than the standard RAV4 and even  many other crossovers in this class. You might also worry about cargo space,  but again the RAV4 Hybrid hardly suffers. Storage is barely impacted by the  hybrid battery pack, which trims space from 38.4 cubic feet to 35.6 cubic feet.  Overall, the RAV4 Hybrid is a compelling compact crossover with all the  benefits of a traditional hybrid with few downsides. With all-wheel drive and battery-amplified fuel economy, the 2017 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid occupies a niche among small crossovers. Whether you're looking for a frugal crossover or a hybrid with more cargo-carrying versatility, it's worth a close look. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the (2.5L  inline-4 hybrid | CVT automatic | AWD). The instant torque provided by the battery and dual electric motors help the Hybrid jump off the line quicker than the standard RAV4. Makes you wish that every compact crossover had a hybrid variant. Zero to 60 mph takes 8 seconds flat, quicker than any non-turbocharged rival. The brake pedal is long and mushy with little resistance. The handoff from regenerative to mechanical brakes is noticeable, making it hard to brake smoothly. Braking to a stop from 60 mph took 123 feet, a few feet longer than average. The RAV4's steering wheel is weighted a little heavier than that of most compact crossovers but is fairly easy to turn. Like many in this class, it's totally devoid of feedback and feel. You wouldn't think a big, heavy crossover (it tips the scales at nearly 4,000 pounds) goes around corners well, but you'd be surprised. The RAV4 Hybrid is composed around sweeping corners at higher speeds. Tight corners and back-to-back transitions reveal ample body roll. The Hybrid pulls away from a stop under battery power, firing up the engine only with liberal application of the gas pedal or once you're past about 20 mph. Avoid driving in Eco mode; it severely dulls throttle response. Sport mode keeps the engine revving higher but responses are sluggish at times. Front seats are comfortable enough, but there's no lumbar adjustment unless you upgrade to the SE (though its faux leather isn't as comfy as the XLE's cloth). Only the driver's seat is height-adjustable. Three-person seating in the back is challenging due to an oddly placed middle seat-belt anchor. The RAV4 Hybrid remains comfortable and composed over rough roads. Neither does it feel floaty or disconnected. Well-done, overall. There's not much engine noise at any speed unless you're really pushing the RAV4 Hybrid hard. Wind and tire noise is overly intrusive while cruising on the highway. The faster you're driving, the less you'll notice the engagement of the gas engine. The dual-zone climate control adeptly cools the interior on a hot day. For those in front, that is \u2014 rear air vents are not available at any level. The cloth seats easily dissipate body heat. The infotainment system features a nice mix between high-level physical buttons and easy-to-press virtual ones. Eco and Sport buttons are slightly hidden on the lower portion of the center stack, in front of the shifter. The door's grab handles intrude on and reduce the length of the armrest. A low step-in height and tall doors make it easy to enter and exit the front, except for drivers who like a raised seat. Steering wheel tilt is limited, and drivers may hit their knees on the column. Entering or exiting the back is also easy thanks to the seats' lack of thigh padding and bolstering. The driver's seat offers a huge range of adjustment in height, and the seat bottom angles up nicely. As in many other Toyotas, the steering wheel doesn't offer much tilt or telescoping adjustment. There's an abundance of head- and legroom throughout the cabin. Four 6-footers will have no problem on a long road trip. Even the middle seat position has enough headroom for adults. The front seats feel a bit narrow. The tall, wide windows allow for an expansive view out. There's a sizable window in the three-quarter view that compensates for the wide rear pillar. The rear window is also large. Overall, the RAV4 Hybrid is impressively easy to see out of. Materials quality in the RAV4 Hybrid is inferior to that of similarly priced competitors. Rivals simply do a better job concealing the use of hard plastics; the RAV4 seems to embrace its economy roots. Our tester had only 4,000 miles on the odometer but exhibited its share of squeaks and rattles. There are two cupholders and a couple small storage areas under the center stack, plus a moderately sized bin under the central armrest and a tray in front of the passenger. Front door pockets aren't especially large and require a stretch to reach. Rear door pockets will only hold a water bottle. The cargo area is wide and flat, with a low liftover height. Maximum cargo volume of 35.6 cubic feet with the rear seats in place and 70.6 cubes with them folded is slightly less than the regular RAV4, but it's larger than what almost every other non-hybrid offers. The lower LATCH anchors are well-concealed and far from the seatback. You really have to reach in and fish around before you find them. The three seatback tethers can be accessed with the cargo cover in place, but these are also hidden under a thin cloth cover. The touchscreen's user interface prioritizes function over form. It has a relatively simple layout and menu structure, though it's not particularly attractive and the screen resolution is fairly low. The screen totally washes out in direct sunlight. There's a single USB port in front and none in the back. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are notably absent. Instead, Toyota utilizes a smartphone integration system of its own design, called Entune. You'll have to download the app, create an account, and pair your phone before it's ready to be used. The RAV4 is now equipped with a ton of standard advanced safety equipment, including lane departure warning and automatic emergency braking. Adaptive cruise overshoots its speed on downhill grades, which is unusual. The low-resolution display translates to a fairly muddy rearview camera picture. Hitting the voice control button displays a list of phrases, and the recognition software also recognizes natural speech. It's not the best, with a lot of garbled translations before it hits the mark. Best to use Siri Eyes Free if you have an iPhone (accessed by holding the phone disconnect button). We think the midtier SE is the one to get. The entry-level XLE with the Convenience package is a good deal, but pay a little more \u2014 and sacrifice the front and rear parking sensors \u2014 and you can get the SE with its faux leather upholstery, heated front seats and LED exterior lighting. It also opens the door to the 11-speaker Entune Premium JBL Audio package for those who absolutely need a bumping sound system. The Limited's upgrades don't seem worth the extra cost.  Highlights  for the XLE include 17-inch alloy  wheels, automatic headlights with auto high-beam control, foglights, heated  mirrors, a sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, a rearview camera,  adaptive cruise control, a height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split folding  and reclining rear seat, a 6.1-inch touchscreen interface (Entune), keyless  entry and ignition, Bluetooth connectivity and a six-speaker sound system with  satellite radio. Several advanced safety systems are standard this year,  including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and lane  departure warning and intervention. Our  favorite is one step up: the SE.  With it you also get LED lighting (including headlights), 18-inch wheels,  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, simulated-leather  upholstery (SofTex), a power driver seat, heated front seats and a power  liftgate,  If you  want it all, though, there's the range-topping Limited trim with its front and rear parking sensors, auto-dimming  rearview mirror, driver-seat memory settings, and a 7-inch touchscreen with  navigation and smartphone app integration. Some of  the SE and Limited's features can be added to the XLE as options. A premium JBL  sound system and a surround-view parking camera system are other notable  options for the SE and Limited. ",

    "full_description": "The Camry Hybrid's base price has been lowered this year to bring it closer to otherwise similarly equipped Camry models. The Hybrid also gets revised options packages this year. The 2008 Toyota Camry Hybrid is a dynamic duo, combining the superior fuel economy of a gasoline-electric powertrain with the mainstream attributes of America's favorite midsize family sedan. Other than better fuel economy, people buy hybrids for a number of reasons. Reducing carbon dioxide emissions is one, and reducing America's dependence on imported oil is another. A third (and less valid) one is that morally superior feeling one gets from owning a car with a hybrid badge. But up to this point, buying a hybrid for financial reasons has been a questionable decision. Quite simply, the price premium for all that high-tech equipment would take years to recoup through fuel savings (and even government tax rebates). The 2008 Toyota Camry Hybrid could change that.With hybrids flying out of Toyota dealers, it makes sense that the cost of producing these sophisticated machines has gone down. Either that or Toyota is just feeling generous, because the Camry Hybrid's base price has been lowered by $1,000 for 2008. It is now only $200 more than a similarly equipped four-cylinder Camry XLE. At that price, buying a hybrid suddenly makes a lot more sense.Aside from being more wallet-friendly and offering revised options packages, the Camry Hybrid is unchanged from its debut last year. It still offers the same seamless gasoline-electric power plant, serene cabin, quiet ride and ample features list. Actually, there was another change, but it depends on how you look at it. The EPA has revised the way it calculates fuel economy to better reflect real-world driving, and that has resulted in a significant lowering in the Camry Hybrid's mpg ratings. At 33 mpg city and 34 mpg highway, the Hybrid can no longer boast last year's unrealistic 40/38 mpg rating, but its fuel economy is still incredibly impressive for a vehicle of its size and performance. Only the mechanically similar Nissan Altima Hybrid can match it.Overall, the 2008 Toyota Camry Hybrid is a very impressive and complete sedan that now has the added benefit of an attractive price. While the Prius remains the fuel-economy champion and is now one of the best-selling cars in the country, the Camry Hybrid offers buyers a more mainstream and traditional package. Its closest competition comes from the aforementioned Altima Hybrid. The Altima offers a nicer interior and a superior driving experience at practically the same price. Sadly, that car is only sold in the five California-emissions states. As such, the Camry Hybrid is likely to be the hybrid of choice for more people, no matter what their reasons are for buying. In the Camry Hybrid, the gas-fueled engine is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder modified for greater fuel efficiency. It's capable of 147 horsepower and 138 pound-feet of torque. The electric motor adds another 40 hp, for a total of 187 when driving conditions call for maximum power. The electric motor can also power the Camry Hybrid on its own, but only under light throttle applications at speeds below 30 mph. Although maximum performance is not a priority for hybrids, this Camry goes from zero to 60 mph in a very respectable 8.4 seconds. Power is directed to the front wheels in a seamless fashion through a simplified continuously variable transmission (CVT).Like most hybrids, the Camry took a hit this year because of the EPA's revised fuel economy calculations. Still, 33 mpg city and 34 mpg highway are very impressive results, and the city number in particular is more than 10 mpg better than other four-cylinder sedans. The Camry Hybrid is also an Advanced Technology Partial-Zero Emissions Vehicle, the cleanest possible rating in terms of air pollution. In some cases, a city's air is actually dirtier than what's coming out of this Camry's tailpipe. Every Camry comes with front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag, antilock brakes, stability control and traction control. In government crash testing, the 2008 Toyota Camry Hybrid received five out of five stars in all front and side collision categories. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety also gave the Camry its highest rating of \"Good\" for frontal-offset and side collision protection. Like the Prius, driving the 2008 Toyota Camry Hybrid can be a bit odd at times due to the CVT, electric motor and eerily quiet cabin at traffic lights. Unlike the Prius, though, the Camry Hybrid offers relatively brisk acceleration, meaning you don't necessarily have to sacrifice performance for good fuel economy. While the Camry offers a smooth ride and quiet cabin, its isolation takes a toll in terms of road feel and general driving dynamics. For those who appreciate a car that offers more feedback and borderline fun, the Nissan Altima Hybrid (that shares Toyota's hybrid system) would be a better choice. Although the Camry's cabin looks snazzier than in years past, the general quality has gone downhill in terms of build quality and materials. It's still better than what some other brands offer, but we've come to expect better from Toyota, and the Nissan Altima Hybrid is more impressive.What it lacks in polish, though, the Camry Hybrid makes up for with space, quiet and comfort. While the regular Camry provides a serenely hushed environment, the Hybrid's ability to travel using only electric power makes it rival King Tut's tomb for quietude. The Camry's comfy seats and oodles of cubbies and compartments make it a very family-friendly environment. The hybrid system's battery packs chew into trunk space (10.6 cubic feet versus 15 in the regular Camry), although a 60/40-split/folding rear seatback provides some added utility when needed. Stuffed together into various packages, Camry Hybrid options include leather upholstery, a sunroof, a four-way power passenger seat, heated front seats, a navigation system, satellite radio and a JBL sound system with a six-CD changer and Bluetooth capability.",

    "full_description": "There are no significant changes to the 2006 Toyota Corolla, although new SAE testing procedures have resulted in lower horsepower ratings. A refined economy sedan that many will purchase on the basis of name alone. Next to its peers, though, the 2006 Toyota Corolla costs too much and isn't much fun to drive. Toyota's venerable Corolla has gone through many changes since it was first introduced in 1968. Over the course of its long life, the Toyota Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan. The world has seen enough people fall in love with this Toyota car to make it the best-selling nameplate in the history of automobiles. You don't earn a distinction like that without some measure of undeterred loyalty. But unlike more notable cult cars, such as the Beetle or the Mustang, the Corolla didn't inspire its massive following because of unique styling or lusty performance. Instead, it has used a more conservative, but no less desirable, combination of an affordable price, excellent fuel economy and superb engineering to convince millions upon millions of car buyers that the Toyota Corolla was the car for them.Based on our testing, the ninth-generation Toyota Corolla sedan is certainly a likable car. Although it's available only in sedan form, the similarly priced Toyota Matrix and Scion tC can accommodate those seeking a small five-door hatchback or two-door coupe. Inside, the Corolla is thoughtfully designed with a user-friendly control layout and materials that seem nice enough to be used in a more expensive Camry. Although room in the front seat is merely average, the backseat is spacious enough to accommodate adults comfortably. Trunk capacity is rated at a generous 13.6 cubic feet. Save for the 164-horsepower Corolla XRS model, performance is about average among economy sedans. If you're looking for nothing more than basic transportation, the Corolla -- particularly a loaded-up version -- seems a bit like overkill. There are a number of sedans that offer equivalent accommodations, features and performance for considerably less money. Do they have the same reputations for quality and reliability? Probably not, but with warranties extending as far as 100,000 miles, it hardly seems much of a risk. For those who are willing to spend a little extra for peace of mind, however, the 2006 Toyota Corolla makes perfect sense. Power for CE, LE and S models comes in the form of a 126-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. Thanks to a variable valve timing system (Toyota's VVT-i), this engine provides decent acceleration. Transmission choices are either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic. The Toyota Corolla XRS features a 164-horsepower 1.8-liter with variable valve timing and lift (VVTL-i) mated to a six-speed manual transmission; an automatic is not available on this model. The Corolla comes with multistage front airbags that deploy at various levels, depending on impact. Full-length side curtain airbags and front side-impact airbags are optional, as are antilock brakes with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (standard on the XRS). Stability control is optional on models equipped with an automatic transmission and ABS. In the NHTSA's crash tests, the Toyota Corolla earned five stars (the best score possible) for frontal-impact protection and four stars for side-impact protection. In 40-mph frontal offset crash testing by the IIHS, it received a \"Good\" rating (the highest possible) and was named a \"Best Pick\" among small cars. When equipped with side airbags, the Corolla rated \"Acceptable\" in the IIHS side-impact test. We've found the Corolla's performance acceptable, with a good off-the-line punch and decent passing power at speed. During highway driving, the 2006 Toyota Corolla is a quiet cruiser, with very little ambient engine noise and even less wind noise. Though not as sporty as some competitors, this Toyota car offers an appealing compromise between handling and comfort. It rides smoothly enough to be used as a commuter car, while maintaining its composure when occasionally pushed around the corners. For those seeking a little extra entertainment without giving up Corolla reliability, the XRS model is a good bet, provided you can deal with its engine's peaky power delivery. The Toyota Corolla interior is furnished with high-quality materials and user-friendly controls that wouldn't seem out of place in a more expensive car. Even with the car's tall cabin design, room in the front seats is only average with a somewhat awkward seating position for the driver. Meanwhile, two adults can sit comfortably in the backseat without ducked heads or pulled-up legs. Trunk capacity measures a generous 13.6 cubic feet. All Corollas come with a 60/40-split folding rear seat, except for the XRS, which deletes this feature to make room for a rear suspension cross brace that tightens up its handling. The five-passenger, front-wheel-drive Toyota Corolla comes as a sedan only. Trim levels include the base CE, the better-equipped LE, the somewhat sporty S and the truly sporty XRS. Standard features in the CE include air conditioning, a four-speaker CD stereo, power mirrors, a height-adjustable driver seat, an outside temperature gauge, 60/40-split folding rear seats and 15-inch wheels. Go with the LE to gain fake wood trim, white-faced gauges, a six-speaker stereo, power windows and locks, and remote keyless entry. The S model does without the LE's power windows, but includes \"sporty\" exterior trim such as a lower body kit and a rear deck spoiler, along with smoked headlights, foglights and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. The XRS has all of the cosmetic upgrades from the S, along with a 164-horsepower engine, 16-inch alloy wheels, a firmer suspension, four-wheel antilock disc brakes, a tire-pressure monitoring system, sport seats and cruise control.",

    "full_description": "For 2015, the Toyota RAV4 is essentially unchanged save for a couple of new options and features. Specifically, there is a new Blizzard Pearl appearance package for the Limited, while the XLE picks up new wheels and the option of a power liftgate. Toyota has also revised the RAV4's frontal structure this year to improve the vehicle's score in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety small-overlap frontal-offset crash test. Although the 2015 Toyota RAV4 isn't a standout in any one area, its combination of features, passenger space and everyday utility warrant a closer look if you're shopping for a small crossover. With their up-for-anything personality, easy-to-park size  and sensible appetite for fuel, compact crossovers are some of the most popular  vehicles on the road. Versatility is their greatest asset, as you can easily fill  them with car seats, groceries, sports equipment or the latest spoils from an  antiquing trip and be on your merry way. Among these practical SUVs, the Toyota  RAV4 has long been a favorite of savvy shoppers of all ages and tastes.\nThanks to increasingly more competent rivals, the 2015  Toyota RAV4 isn't quite the no-brainer pick anymore. Still, you'll likely find that  it checks off most of the boxes on your \"must-have\" list. The  \"compact\" classification is almost unjust, given the Toyota RAV4's  roomy passenger and cargo compartments. The latter is especially noteworthy not  only for its capacity (which at 73.3 cubic feet is among the most generous in  its class) but its laudable usability. Whether you're loading it up with a couple  of dogs or a couple of bags of heavy top soil, you'll appreciate the cargo  bay's low load floor and, on upper trims, the availability of an  adjustable-height power liftgate.\nA pleasant demeanor on the road makes the RAV4 especially  likable. In particular, good outward visibility, a composed attitude around  corners and a smooth, quiet ride are character traits anybody can appreciate.  But unlike most competitors, this Toyota offers  just one engine choice. There's no engine upgrade if you'd like more oomph than  the average performance. Also, the RAV4's fuel economy numbers are good, but  not class-leading.\nGiven the quality of the competition in the small crossover  class, it's worth checking out a few alternatives. When it comes to all-around  versatility, the 2015 Honda  CR-V dominates the class thanks to its roomy cabin, abundance of storage  compartments, strong fuel economy and quiet, comfortable ride. Those who truly  enjoy driving should consider the engaging and athletic 2015 Mazda CX-5, though  its interior isn't quite as functional as  the others. There's also the well-regarded 2015 Ford Escape, which boasts a choice of three engines and a  well-trimmed cabin. Finally, if you plan on taking any off-road excursions, the 2015 Jeep Cherokee is  tops in that area, and it's also one of the few models available with a V6  engine.\nAll things considered, the 2015 Toyota RAV4 is not  overwhelmingly strong in any one area, but it shines as a solid, well-rounded entry  in a very competitive segment. As such, the RAV4 should easily meet the needs  of most shoppers. The 2015 Toyota RAV4 is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder  engine that produces 176 horsepower and 172 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed  automatic transmission is standard, and all versions of the RAV4 are available  with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.\nIn Edmunds testing, an  all-wheel-drive Toyota RAV4 took 9.2 seconds to hit 60 mph, an average time for  a small crossover with a base four-cylinder engine.\nThe front-drive RAV4 is EPA-rated at 26 mpg  combined (23 city/31 highway) in LE and XLE trim (with a slightly lower 30  mpg highway rating  on the Limited); these are good, but not class-leading numbers for a small  crossover. All AWD models are rated at 25 mpg combined (22 city/29 highway). Standard safety equipment on every 2015 Toyota RAV4 includes  antilock disc brakes, a rearview camera, stability control, traction control,  whiplash-reducing front head restraints, front-seat side airbags and  full-length side curtain airbags. A driver knee airbag is also standard. A  rearview camera is standard across the board, while the optional Technology  package on the Limited provides blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic  alerts and lane departure warnings.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the RAV4 stopped from 60 mph in  128 feet, which is about 5 feet longer than average.\nIn government  crash tests, the Toyota RAV4 received four out of five stars for  overall protection, with four stars awarded for frontal protection and five  stars for side-impact protection. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety  crash tests, the 2015 RAV4 earned a top score of \"Good\" for its protection of occupants in the moderate-overlap and small-overlap frontal-offset  impact tests. It also earned a \"Good\" score for the side-impact, roof  strength and seats and head restraints tests. Most small crossover shoppers will find this Toyota's 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine adequate for most tasks and sufficiently fuel-efficient.  The six-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly, but if you tend to drive  assertively, you'll find it slow to downshift in passing situations.  Additionally, when climbing steady mountain grades, we've noticed that the  transmission has a tendency to hunt between gears (rather than picking one gear  and sticking with it). Both of these characteristics are likely a consequence  of the powertrain being tuned for maximum gas mileage.\nThe 2015 Toyota RAV4 handles well and feels refined and  comfortable when cruising down the highway. A potential exception is the  Limited model, which can get a little jittery on rough pavement due to its big  18-inch wheels. In spite of that, the cabin remains very quiet, making Toyota's  crossover a good option for families with young children who tend to sleep in  the car.\nOverall, the RAV4 is similar in personality to Honda's CR-V,  and more demanding drivers might find it less enjoyable to drive than sportier  crossovers like the CX-5 and Escape, which have more responsive steering and sharper  acceleration. If comfort is your overriding priority, though, the Toyota should  do right by you. Additionally, if you ever need to venture off the beaten path,  the RAV4's available AWD system quickly applies power where it's needed for  optimum traction, giving it a decent amount of off-road ability. The 2015 Toyota RAV4 features an interior design with pronounced  angles and lines that form a streamlined and modern-looking dash. Overall,  though, the RAV's design and materials are average for the compact crossover  class, and a few of the audio and climate controls feel slightly flimsy. The  cupholder count is adequate, but there aren't as many useful storage cubbies as  you'll find in the CR-V.\nAlthough all of the RAV4's  audio systems have Toyota's Entune branding, only XLE and Limited models with  the navigation system include the Entune suite of  smartphone-connected services, among these the Bing search engine, Pandora  streaming radio and traffic, sports and stock information. There's quite a bit  of functionality here, but getting started with Entune can be a hassle: You  have to install an app on your phone and register for an account, plus you  always need an active data connection to use its features. The touchscreen  interface has straightforward menus, but it's sometimes unresponsive to user  touch (curiously, we've found the more basic touchscreen in the LE better in  this regard). On the upside, all the conventional controls in the 2015 RAV4 are  easy to use.\nRear seat passenger comfort is hampered slightly by a  low-mounted backseat, but space is nevertheless abundant enough even for taller  adults. We also like how the seat provides a large amount of recline adjustment.\nThe cargo bay measures 38.4 cubic feet and opens up to a  generous 73.3 cubes when the second row is folded. That's one of the largest  capacities in the class. There's also a payoff for that low-mounted rear seat:  a very flat load floor and low load-in height, both of which help minimize the  strain of loading heavy items or even a couple of large dogs. The  power-operated and height-adjustable liftgate is especially convenient. \nThe LE comes standard with 17-inch steel wheels, automatic  headlights, power-folding mirrors, keyless entry, rear privacy glass, full power  accessories, air-conditioning, cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, a 60/40-split and reclining second-row seat, a rearview camera,  Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity and a six-speaker sound system with a  6.1-inch touchscreen, a CD player, an auxiliary audio jack and an iPod/USB  audio interface.\nThe XLE adds 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, heated side  mirrors with integrated turn signals, roof rails, a sunroof, dual-zone  automatic climate control, sportier front seats, a cargo cover and extendable  sun visors. The audio system is upgraded on the XLE to include satellite radio,  HD radio, traffic and weather. Options for the XLE include a height-adjustable  power liftgate, a navigation system and Toyota's Entune smartphone app  integration.\nThe top-level Limited comes with all of the above plus  18-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry and ignition, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, an eight-way  power-adjustable driver seat with memory settings, heated front seats and  premium synthetic leather upholstery.\nOptions on the Limited include a navigation system bundled  with a premium 11-speaker JBL  audio system. The Technology package adds a blind-spot monitoring system  with rear cross-traffic alerts, a lane-departure warning system and automatic  high-beam control for the headlights. There's  also the Blizzard Pearl Premium Package, which features Blizzard Pearl paint  along with 18-inch machine-finished wheels with black accents. ",

    "full_description": "Toyota offers a four-cylinder version of the Highlander for 2009, but only on the base two-wheel-drive version of this popular crossover. With plenty of room, power and features, the 2009 Toyota Highlander is optimized for family use. If you're shopping for a midsize crossover SUV, make sure you try this Toyota. Boasting midsize SUV versatility without the attendant poor fuel mileage and trucklike handling and ride, the 2009 Toyota Highlander exemplifies the virtues of a now-flourishing vehicle breed -- the crossover SUV. When the first-generation Highlander debuted nearly a decade ago, it was a trailblazer in this segment, demonstrating that a vehicle could look and function like an SUV without driving like one. Today, the second-generation Highlander is in its sophomore year of production, and it's just one of many highly competent crossovers on the market. It remains one of the best, though, thanks to its flexible and ergonomically sound interior, secure handling and forceful yet frugal V6.For 2009, the Toyota Highlander stands pat with the exception of a new four-cylinder version being offered in base two-wheel-drive trim. As such, most new Highlanders will still be fitted with Toyota's superb 3.5-liter V6 that is doubly blessed with impressive output (270 horsepower) and higher-than-average fuel economy. Inside, the Highlander continues to offer useful features such as Center Stow, which allows easy stowage of the center section of the 40/20/40 second-row bench seat, thus providing walk-through access to the third row.As good as it is, the Highlander now competes in a segment that is awash with many strong candidates. General Motors' Lambda-platform quadruplets (Buick Enclave/Chevrolet Traverse/GMC Acadia/Saturn Outlook), Hyundai's Veracruz  and Mazda's CX-9 are all excellent choices. The Highlander isn't quite as cavernous inside as the GM crossovers, so it might not be the best choice for bigger families. However, if you don't have five kids who could stand in for the New England Patriots' defensive line, and you find the Toyota's all-around versatility appealing, the refined and relatively economical 2009 Toyota Highlander is hard to top. Every 2009 Toyota Highlander except the base front-wheel-drive version comes with a 3.5-liter V6 rated at 270 hp and 248 pound-feet of torque. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional on all but the base four-cylinder model. A five-speed automatic transmission is standard, and regular 87-octane fuel is all that's required. The new 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine is not exactly a slouch, cranking out 187 hp and 186 lb-ft of torque, and it's matched to a six-speed automatic to optimize performance and fuel economy. At our test track, a Highlander Limited V6 AWD sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 7.8 seconds, making it one of the quickest vehicles in its segment. Properly equipped, the V6-powered Highlander can tow 5,000 pounds, a respectable figure for this segment.With the V6, the front-drive Highlander's fuel mileage stands at 18 mpg city/24 mpg highway and 20 mpg combined; an AWD V6 version rates 1 mpg less across the board. As of this writing, estimates for the four-cylinder Highlander were not yet available. All expected safety equipment is standard on the Toyota Highlander, including antilock disc brakes, stability control and hill-start assist (which keeps the vehicle from rolling backward when starting on uphill grades). All-wheel-drive models come with a downhill assist feature to enable slow, controlled descents down snow-covered driveways. Airbag coverage includes front-seat side airbags, three-row side curtain airbags and a driver-side knee airbag.In government crash tests, the 2009 Toyota Highlander scored five stars (the highest possible) for the driver and four for the passenger in frontal impacts and five stars for side impacts. In frontal offset crash testing conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Highlander earned the top rating of \"Good.\" Although the current Highlander is considerably larger and heavier than the previous generation, it's still more pleasant to drive than most other midsize SUVs, even those of the crossover variety. Visibility is excellent all around, and the steering is light enough to make the 2009 Toyota Highlander easy to maneuver in tight spaces yet adequately precise while cornering. The V6 is a highlight, delivering strong, smooth acceleration in any situation. The ride quality leans toward the soft side, even with the Sport trim level, but that's to be expected in a family-oriented crossover. Larger adults will find the Highlander's interior more accommodating than in the previous generation, as first- and second-row room have grown noticeably in all directions. At the same time, the control layout remains simple and easy to understand, and the quality of the interior materials is high. The Highlander's third-row legroom falls short of what's available from competing large crossover SUVs, but getting into the third row is much easier, thanks to the second-row seats' improved fold-and-slide mechanisms. There's also a specialized center section of the 40/20/40 second-row bench seat that provides walk-through access to the third row. The middle \"20\" section simply slides into its own cubby under the front seat center console.Cargo space is scant when all three rows are in use, measuring just over 10 cubic feet. Folding the third row yields 42 cubes, though, and with the second row down, there's a healthy 95.4 cubic feet -- still short of the Mazda and GM crossovers, but otherwise a good figure for this class. Our only complaint is that the third-row seat folds as a single piece rather than offering a 50/50 split, thus limiting your options when you have a mix of passengers and cargo to carry. The base version comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, privacy glass, a fold-flat third-row seat (which can be deleted for a credit), a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, air-conditioning, a CD stereo with an auxiliary input jack and full power accessories. Stepping up to the Sport provides 19-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, automatic headlights, foglights, a flip-up rear hatch window, a 3.5-inch information display screen, a back-up camera, an in-dash CD changer (with MP3/WMA capability), upgraded seat fabric, a power driver seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and one-touch folding capability for the second-row seats.Like the Sport, the Highlander Limited wears 19-inch wheels but goes with softer suspension tuning and adds more luxury in the form of power-folding and heated outside mirrors, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather upholstery, a power passenger seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, keyless entry and ignition and wood-grain interior trim.Options include a rear air-conditioner for base and Sport models, automatic rear climate control for Limited models, a power sunroof, a power liftgate, heated front seats, a rear DVD entertainment system and towing preparation. The premium-grade JBL sound system supplies Bluetooth connectivity and increases the speaker count from six to nine, but its in-dash changer maxes out at four CDs instead of the usual six. The available navigation system can only be ordered in conjunction with the JBL audio upgrade.",

    "full_description": "Traditionally, there have been some  significant downsides to picking a hybrid version of a regular sedan. The  hybrid is usually slower, less practical because of a smaller trunk (need to  stick that big old battery pack somewhere) and styled with dorky-looking wheels  and blue, green or teal accents.  \nBut the 2020 Toyota Avalon Hybrid flips  that script.. While still slow \u2014 nearly 1.5 seconds slower than  the non-hybrid Toyota Avalon V6 in 0-60 mph acceleration \u2014 the  hybrid generates quick and satisfying low-end torque for daily driving and  returns up to 44 mpg combined while doing it. The hybrid also only costs $1,000  more than the standard Avalon. Given what you'd likely end up saving on gas,  you'll probably recoup that difference in just a couple of years. \nThe Avalon Hybrid is also surprisingly  enjoyable to drive. You can guide it into turns with confidence since the  suspension feels stable and body roll is well-controlled. Swap out the  low-friction tires for some proper all-season rubber and the Avalon might show  some real swagger. \nAnd that battery pack? Toyota found a way  to package it without compromising utility. The hybrid offers the same 16.1 cubic  feet of trunk space as its non-hybrid counterpart, and the rear seats can also  fold flat. \nLike the regular Toyota Avalon, the  hybrid offers  levels of comfort and convenience that blur the line between Toyota and its  Lexus luxury brand. In fact, the Avalon Hybrid's fiercest competitor might just  be from across the hall. Stretch your budget just a little further and you're  in the Lexus ES 300h.  The  2020 Toyota Avalon Hybrid in Limited trim should satisfy the typical large-sedan buyer. It forgoes the sporty  touches of the XSE model in favor of more Lexus-like luxurious refinement. It's  also the only trim eligible for rear parking sensors with cross-traffic braking  and a surround-view camera. How does the Avalon Hybrid drive? The Avalon Hybrid makes the most of its available power. The CVT automatic is responsive when you step on the gas pedal, even when you select the Eco drive mode. We recorded a 0-60 mph time of 8.2 seconds in Edmunds testing. That's slower than V6-powered rivals, but we think most buyers will find this acceptable for the considerable gains in fuel economy.\n\n   Braking feels natural in most situations thanks to an imperceptible transition from regenerative to regular brakes. We measured a panic-stop performance from 60 mph in 126 feet, which is around the class average, though the sounds our test car made in the process were a bit more alarming than usual. Despite its luxury cruiser attitude, the Avalon Hybrid is surprisingly fun to drive around tight corners and maintains its composure surprisingly well. How comfortable is the Avalon Hybrid? All-around comfort is the primary reason you'd consider a sedan like this, and the Avalon Hybrid delivers. The ride is cushy without feeling buoyant like some rivals. The seats are welcoming too, with soft leather and compliant cushions. Our Limited trim test vehicle had heated and ventilated seats and a heated steering wheel, all of which worked well. The rear outboard seats are also heated in the Limited.\n\n   Like most hybrids, the Avalon isn't immune to the shudder that passes through the cabin as the gasoline engine fires up. The hybrid system can also produce some low-volume but high-pitched whirring noises while the car is stopped. How\u2019s the interior? The Avalon's interior is a pleasant place to spend time in, though there are some faults. Some controls and buttons are out of reach or hard to find, especially the ones near your left knee. The Avalon also sits rather low, which may present a problem to passengers who are less limber. We're also not enamored of its size. Despite being more expensive, the Avalon isn't much larger than a Toyota Camry, and there's less rear headroom due to the Avalon's raked roof.\n\n   Otherwise, the Avalon's cabin is quite nice. Most drivers will find an agreeable position, as the steering wheel and driver's seat both offer a useful range of travel. Rear visibility is good overall, though the rear shelf is high. How\u2019s the tech? The redesigned Avalon gets Toyota's latest infotainment system, which now features Apple CarPlay. There are plenty of USB ports plus an optional wireless charging pad. Passengers jockeying for a free port is effectively a thing of the past.\n\n   The touchscreen has a bright, attractive display and an easy-to-use integrated navigation system. As with most systems, you cannot enter a new address while moving. For that, you have to use the voice command system, which is frequently confused and has limited point-of-interest search.\n\n   Most of the Avalon's driving aids are standard and work well, though adaptive cruise control has a tendency to leave a large gap between you and the car in front. How\u2019s the storage? Most big sedans have a cavernous trunk, and the Avalon Hybrid is no exception. In fact, the trunk is the same size as the regular Avalon's \u2014 16.1 cubic feet. While there's no longer a pass-through, the rear seats can fold down to increase cargo space.\n\n   Interior storage is similarly generous, at least for those in front. The center armrest has room similar to what you'd find in an SUV, and there's a nicely sized bin in front of the shifter, which also houses the wireless charging pad. The door pockets aren't large, which limits storage in the back, but overall it's quite good.\n\n   The car-seat anchors and generous interior space make loading a child seat a breeze. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Avalon Hybrid Limited is rated at 43 mpg combined (43 city/44 highway). It's a little thirstier than midsize sedans such as the Honda Accord Hybrid (48 mpg combined) and the Camry Hybrid (46 mpg combined), but it's far more efficient than the standard Avalon (26 mpg). Is the Avalon Hybrid a good value? Though the Avalon Hybrid has some hard touch points, its interior materials are a clear step above those in the Camry. There are even a few surprises in the form of premium-looking quilted stitching on the seats and doors.\n\n   The Avalon Hybrid is only marginally more expensive than an identically equipped Avalon, though a similarly equipped Lexus ES 300h doesn't cost too much more. The basic and powertrain coverage is average for the class. Toyota also offers free scheduled maintenance for your first two visits. You'll be impressed by how enjoyable the Avalon Hybrid is to drive. Handling is composed, even though grip is ultimately low, and body roll is well-controlled. The only real downside is the powertrain's slowish acceleration.\n\n   Is there personality here? No, not really. Other than the oversized front grille, the Avalon is conservatively styled and accomplishes exactly what you'd expect.",

    "full_description": "More and more hybrid vehicles are coming  out every year, yet the Toyota Prius, the granddaddy of them all, remains at  the forefront. It provides high fuel economy (more than 50 mpg), a comfortable  ride and a versatile cargo area. There's also the argument for peace of mind  since Toyota certainly has a long history of making reliable hybrid vehicles. For  2019, car shoppers have another reason to consider the Prius: available  all-wheel drive. The new Prius AWD-e adds an electric motor to drive the rear  wheels for better initial traction between 0 and 6 mph and re-engages when  front tire slippage is detected at speeds up to 43 mph. If you live in an area  that has snowy or icy roads during the winter, the AWD-e could provide extra  traction. Fuel economy suffers only slightly with the Prius AWD-e. But any Prius comes with a trade-off: performance. The Prius is neither quick nor engaging to drive. Additionally, its infotainment system isn't the easiest to use and lacks Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration. We recommend giving the Prius a shot, but newer, more well-rounded competitors such as the Honda Insight make it a somewhat tougher sell.\nWhat's it like to live with?\n To learn more about the Toyota Prius of this generation, read about our experiences from living with a 2016 Toyota Prius. After its debut, we went out and bought one, holding onto it for almost four years and racking up more than 30,000 miles. We cover everything from this hybrid's real-world fuel economy to seat comfort and cargo space. Please note that the 2019 Toyota Prius differs from our long-term 2016 model in that the newer model has updated styling and more standard features. It's the same generation, though, so most of our observations still apply. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the Toyota Prius XLE AWD-e Hatchback (1.8L inline-4 hybrid | CVT automatic | AWD). Acceleration is adequate. A 9.8-second 0-60 mph time is near the bottom of the segment, though the Prius has enough zip off the line to feel lively around town. In our emergency braking test, the Prius posted an average stopping performance. Except at crawling speeds, pedal feel is smooth and linear without any of the awkwardness indicative of many hybrid systems. The steering is direct, though it doesn't provide much feedback from the road. The system is well-weighted, and little effort is required to point the Prius in the intended direction without catching grooves or seams. The Prius feels responsive and reasonably agile on the street. Body roll is present and the tires fight for grip, but the car never feels unwieldy or dangerous. The Prius remains composed over midcorner bumps and dips. The transition from EV to hybrid mode is unobtrusive, though the engine sounds harsh when firing up. Acceleration is smooth. The cruise control holds speed well going both up- and downhill. The seat offers a lot of vertical adjustment, but there's no lumbar adjustment. The seat cushion remains comfortable after long drives. The moderate side bolstering supports without squeezing. The Prius is smooth and composed on the street. Rebound over bumps is minimal, and the car never feels too bouncy or too stiff. Broken or uneven pavement doesn't upset the car or translate into a harsh ride quality. Extremely quiet in EV mode, but the engine provides a noticeable hum, which is exacerbated when the transmission keeps the engine's rpm high. Wind noise is moderate and not overly booming. Single-zone automatic climate control is standard across the board and works reasonably well. The S mode function smartly cuts airflow to unoccupied seats to reduce power use by the A/C system. The heated front seats adequately warm passengers, but the switches' awkward location (under the center console) makes it easy to forget when they're on. The touchscreen is user-friendly and very responsive, but other functions are controlled by touch-capacitive icons and not real buttons. Most controls are simple and well-placed, but the odd shifter design and center-mounted gauges provide no tangible benefit. The Prius is quite easy to get in and out of. The doors open wide, allowing easy access to the front. Rear-seat access is also good but is hampered slightly by the sloping roofline. There's generous room in front for heads, legs and shoulders. Rear seating is also very good. Forward visibility is great, with large windows and a low dash providing a great view. Rear visibility is OK, but the split in the glass cuts through the sightline. Over-the-shoulder visibility is only slightly hindered by a sloping roof. The Prius feels solidly built, and overall it uses nice materials throughout the cabin. But it is beginning to slip behind competitors such as the Honda Insight and Accord Hybrid. The very plasticky trim on the center console of certain models will prove polarizing for some buyers. Storage for small items is surprisingly good in this compact hatchback. If you aren't using the Qi charging pad, you can store plenty of stuff under the center stack. The center console is narrow but deep, and even the rear cupholders have decent depth. None of the door pockets are spacious. The Prius provides a generous cargo area (24.6 cubic feet), with folding rear seats for extra space. The rear seats fold flat relative to the ground, but there's a level change from the cargo load floor. We like that you can fold the rear seats without moving the front seats forward. The four lower LATCH anchors are large and easy to access, hidden thoughtfully behind leather flaps. Tethers are located halfway down the seatback, under cutouts in the seatback fabric. The tethers are impossible to access without removing the cargo cover first. The touchscreen interface is ugly and sometimes cluttered, but it's functional and easy to operate once you get used to it. Onboard navigation is available. The maps are less attractive than what you'll find on your smartphone, but they offer a good alternative if you're without cell service. The screen washes out in direct sunlight. The Prius offers Toyota's in-house Entune software for smartphone integration. Setup requires a lengthy app download and account creation process. Entune's app support is meager and less intuitive than CarPlay or Android Auto (neither of which is offered). The Bluetooth menu offers better control and search functionality than most other Bluetooth systems. A ton of driving aids are standard, and most are available on the lowly Prius Two trim. There's even an automated parking function on high-end models. There's good feature availability, and most work well. Like many competing systems, the adaptive cruise control is overly sensitive and slams on the brakes as drivers enter your lane. Voice controls work reasonably well. There's some natural speech detection, so you don't have to follow the voice prompts religiously. You can interact with your phone's mobile assistant, but you hold the phone call button, rather than the more common voice control button, to access it. The  Prius is all about fuel economy and the base L Eco's 56 mpg combined EPA  estimate is difficult to ignore. Unfortunately, the L is a little light on  features. As such, we recommend getting the LE. It comes with some useful upgrades, such as blind-spot  monitoring, a rear wiper and a traditional spare tire, while keeping the price  reasonable. The LE is also available with the Prius' new all-wheel-drive  system. Power  for the Prius comes from a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine and a pair of  electric motors/generators. Their combined 121 horsepower is sent through a  continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) to the front wheels. The  AWD-e models add an electric motor for the rear axle. The L Eco trim is equipped with  ultra-low-rolling resistance tires, a lighter hybrid battery, and an inflation  kit instead of a spare tire. Those features help contribute to the L Eco's  impressive 56 mpg combined rating. The other Prius trims are rated at 52 mpg or  50 mpg (AWD-e).Standard  features for the L Eco include 15-inch wheels, automatic LED headlights, LED  running lights and taillights, heated mirrors, keyless entry (driver door only)  and ignition, automatic climate control, dual 4.2-inch driver information  screens, adaptive cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, cloth  upholstery, a height-adjustable driver's seat and a 60/40-split folding rear  seat.Also standard is a 6.1-inch touchscreen display, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, a front USB port and two rear charge ports and a six-speaker audio system. Standard safety features include automatic high beams, forward collision warning, forward collision mitigation with automatic braking and lane departure warning and intervention.The LE trim adds a rear window wiper,  front seatback pockets, a spare tire, parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring  with rear cross-traffic alert, and an automated parallel parking system. Stepping  up to the XLE trim brings 17-inch  wheels, automatic wipers, keyless entry for the front passenger door and rear  hatch, SofTex simulated leather upholstery and wrapped steering wheel, a  power-adjustable driver's seat, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a semi-gloss  black center console and a wireless charging pad. It also reverts back to the  tire inflation kit.At  the top of the Prius range is the Limited trim that adds adaptive headlights, a head-up display, Toyota's Safety Connect  emergency communications, a navigation system, an 11.6-inch touchscreen, and a  10-speaker premium JBL audio system with satellite radio. Some  features, including a sunroof, are available on supporting trims as options.",

Also, the touchscreen infotainment offerings have been enhanced, and the available rearview camera now broadcasts to the touchscreen display on all eligible models (the Access Cab previously used a small screen on the rearview mirror). With its three cab styles, two bed lengths and updated technology features, the 2014 Toyota Tacoma remains a class-leading midsize truck. You wouldn't know it from the commercials on TV, but not all  pickup trucks these days are thundering beasts built to tow your house off its  foundation. There's also a \"midsize\" class of trucks, and the 2014  Toyota Tacoma is arguably its most distinguished member. For nearly a decade  now, the current Tacoma has been meeting the needs of truck shoppers who value  efficiency and manageable dimensions. And although the 2014 model is largely  the same truck that debuted way back in 2005, the past few years have brought  new technology features that keep the Tacoma feeling fresh.\nThe big news two years ago was the introduction of Toyota's touchscreen interface with  \"Entune\" mobile apps and navigation, but availability was limited to  the pricey Double Cab V6. Last year, a basic 6.1-inch touchscreen (sans mobile  apps and navigation) became standard on all Tacoma models, even the  stripped-down 4x2 Regular Cab. For 2014, the standard touchscreen is joined by  an optional enhanced version for both Access and Double Cabs, and these models  also offer mobile apps and navigation. The only bummer is that the Regular  Cab's touchscreen can't be upgraded from the standard, no-frills specification.\nWhether you care about that stuff or not, chances are you'll  like the Tacoma's versatile skill set. If you just need a simple light-duty  work truck, the base four-cylinder Regular Cab promises years of reliable  service, and you can even get it with four-wheel drive in colder climates. If  you're looking for a backseat as well, the extended Access Cab and four-door  Double Cab should fit the bill, and they bring the powerful V6 engine into  play. There are also two bed lengths, multiple trim packages and various  dealer-installed accessories to choose from. In short, there's a Tacoma for  pretty much everyone, unless you really do require the massive capabilities of  a full-size truck.\nIf you're looking for Tacoma alternatives, there aren't many  these days, though the new 2015 Chevrolet Colorado is waiting in the  wings. For the 2014 model year, its only direct rival is the 2014 Nissan  Frontier, which is similarly  well-rounded but more basic inside -- and no longer offered in regular-cab  form. The other truck on the Tacoma's radar is the 2014 Honda Ridgeline, a cleverly  designed crew-cab rig with relatively limited capabilities due to its car-based  underpinnings.\nOverall, the Toyota remains  a can't-miss choice in this sensible segment. You probably couldn't tow a space  shuttle behind it, but for most real-world jobs, the Tacoma's got you covered. The 2014 Toyota Tacoma is available with rear- or four-wheel  drive and a choice of two engines: a 2.7-liter four-cylinder or 4.0-liter V6. \nAll Tacomas except 4WD Double Cab models come standard with  the four-cylinder engine, which is rated at 159 horsepower and 180 pound-feet  of torque. A five-speed manual transmission is standard on Regular and Access  Cab models, while the rear-drive-only PreRunner Access and Double Cabs get a standard  four-speed automatic that's optional on the others.\nA Tacoma with the four-cylinder and five-speed manual  returns an EPA-estimated 23 mpg  combined (21 mpg city/25 mpg highway) with rear-wheel drive, dropping to 21 mpg  combined (19 mpg city/24 mpg highway) with the automatic. Adding four-wheel  drive yields 19 mpg  combined (18 mpg city/21 mpg highway) with either transmission.\nThe V6 is rated at 236 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. It isn't  offered on Regular Cab models, but it comes standard with the 4WD Double Cab,  and it's optional on the 4WD Access Cab and both PreRunner configurations  (Access and Double Cab). The PreRunner V6 models come only with a five-speed  automatic transmission, but the V6-powered 4WD Access Cab and Double Cab come  standard with a six-speed manual (the five-speed automatic is optional).\nThe V6/automatic team yields 19 mpg  combined (17 mpg city/21 mpg highway) with rear-wheel drive and 18 mpg  combined (16 mpg city/21 mpg highway) with four-wheel drive. The V6/manual  tandem (a 4WD-only proposition now that the X-Runner is gone) returns 17 mpg  combined (16 mpg city/19 mpg highway).\nIn Edmunds performance testing, a 4WD Tacoma Double Cab V6  with the automatic covered zero to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds -- suitably quick for  a midsize truck. Properly equipped, a Tacoma V6 can tow up to 6,500 pounds. Standard safety equipment on the 2014 Toyota Tacoma includes  antilock brakes (front disc, rear drum) with brake assist, stability control,  front-seat side-impact airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and front  active head restraints. A rearview camera is optional.\nIn Edmunds brake testing, the aforementioned Double Cab 4WD  V6 stopped from 60 mph in a commendable 126 feet. A Double Cab Tacoma with the  TRD TX Baja package took 143 feet to stop, a considerably longer distance but  not unexpected with the all-terrain tires equipped.\nIn government crash testing, the 2014 Toyota Tacoma received  an overall rating  of four stars out of five. Double Cab models received three out of five  stars for frontal crash impact protection, and all other Tacomas received four  stars. Access and Double Cab Tacomas received five stars for side crash  protection, while the Regular Cab scored four stars.\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Tacoma  its top rating  of \"Good\" in the moderate-overlap frontal offset and side crash  tests, but its second-to-worst rating of \"Marginal\" in the roof  strength test. Its seat/head restraint design was rated \"Good\" for  whiplash protection in rear impacts. The four-cylinder Tacoma can seem  overly noisy and its performance certainly isn't going to blow anyone's doors  off, but thanks to a healthy 180 pound-feet of torque, it actually packs a  decent punch. This isn't a transplanted Camry engine or anything like that; it  was designed specifically for truck duty, and its respectable fuel economy  makes it a smart choice for small-business contractors. The V6 engine is  considerably brawnier, of course, and it's a no-brainer if you plan to do any  serious towing.\nOn paved surfaces, the 2014 Toyota  Tacoma rides firmly, particularly with one of the TRD suspension setups. It's  not objectionable, but it certainly lacks the Ridgeline's carlike smoothness.  The soft brake pedal fails to inspire confidence, even though its measured  performance is fine. Off-road, however, the Tacoma 4WD is a star, providing  serious capability in an unassuming package. The comprehensive TRD Off-Road  package is tempting, yet the four-cylinder 4WD Regular Cab is one of the best  go-anywhere bargains you'll find. The 2014 Toyota Tacoma has a straightforward dashboard  layout that puts practicality first, including simple three-dial climate knobs  that are easily turned by gloved hands. Most panels are made of hard plastic,  but build quality is perennially strong. Feature content is generally  impressive, headlined by the standard touchscreen display with iPod/USB and  Bluetooth connectivity, which makes the Regular Cab's crank windows and manual  locks seem highly incongruous.\nThe front bucket seats offer firm support, though some  drivers may find that their low mounting points relative to the floor hampers  comfort. While the Access Cab's rear jump seats are only fit for small children  or cargo, the Double Cab's backseat is surprisingly adult-friendly, especially  compared with the cramped crew-cab Nissan Frontier. In both cases, the rear  seats flip up or fold down to provide an enclosed storage space.\nThe Tacoma's utility is enhanced by the standard composite  bedliner, which guards against the dents and dings that typically accumulate in  a truck bed. The optional bed-mounted 115-volt power outlet can be a real asset  when you're on the job, and it'll also win you friends and admirers when  camping or tailgating. \nStandard features on the rear-drive (2WD) Tacoma Regular Cab  include 15-inch steel wheels, a limited-slip rear differential,  air-conditioning, a composite bedliner, a bed utility rail system, a cloth  bench seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, Bluetooth phone  and audio connectivity, a 6.1-inch touchscreen display and a four-speaker CD  audio system with iPod/USB connectivity and an auxiliary audio jack. A sliding  rear window is optional.\nThe 2WD Access Cab adds upgraded cloth upholstery, full  carpeting, power locks and windows, front bucket seats, a center console, an  overhead console, fold-up rear seats with under-seat storage, and dual rear  cupholders.\nThe 2WD Double Cab adds black fenders, power mirrors,  adjustable driver lumbar, a 60/40-split rear bench seat with adjustable  headrests, rear bulkhead storage and rear climate vents.\nSpecifying four-wheel drive on any base Tacoma brings an  increased ride height, 16-inch steel wheels, black fenders (already standard on  Double Cab), an engine skid plate and front mud guards. \nThe PreRunner, offered in both Access and Double Cab  configurations, is a rear-wheel-drive Tacoma that otherwise shares the standard  features found on the 4WD Tacoma.\nAll Access and Double Cab models are eligible for two  packages. The Convenience package adds power mirrors (Access Cab only), keyless  entry, cruise control, a tinted sliding rear window and steering-wheel audio  controls. The SR5 package includes those items plus chrome grille and rear  bumper trim, color-keyed front bumper and fenders, foglights (V6 only),  adjustable driver lumbar support (already standard on Double Cab), unique seat  fabric, variable intermittent wipers, metallic-look instrument panel trim, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel and (automatic-only) shift knob, dual sun visors  with mirrors and extenders, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and a rearview  camera.\nThe SR package (PreRunner, 4WD Access Cab and 4WD Double Cab  only) adds extended color-keyed exterior trim, exclusive black 16-inch alloy  wheels, mirror-mounted turn signals, smoked headlights and (on V6 models) fog  lights. The TRD TX Baja package adds some off-road flair with a more aggressive  look, all-terrain tires, unique black alloy wheels, Bilstein shocks, a cat-back exhaust, an  increased front ride height and side graphics.\nV6-powered PreRunners and 4WD Tacomas are additionally  eligible for the TRD Off-Road package, which includes the SR5 package plus a  heavy-duty suspension with Bilstein shocks, a locking rear differential,  Hill-Start Assist and Downhill Assist (4WD automatic models only), 16-inch  alloy wheels, TRD graphics, a 115-volt power point in the bed and sport seats.  Alternatively, these models can be equipped with the TRD Sport package, which  features a sport-tuned suspension (also with Bilsteins), 17-inch alloy wheels,  a hood scoop, extended color-keyed exterior trim, the bed-mounted power outlet  and essentially the same interior features at the TRD Off-Road package.\nFinally, the Limited package (V6 Double Cabs only) includes  the SR5 package's items plus 18-inch chrome wheels, extended chrome exterior  trim, an auto-dimming rearview mirror with an outside temperature gauge and Homelink, heated front seats,  synthetic leather upholstery and a higher-resolution touchscreen with HD radio,  satellite radio, a navigation system and the Entune mobile-app suite.\nV6 Double Cabs can also be equipped with a premium JBL audio  system that includes a subwoofer. The upgraded touchscreen is available  separately on both Access and Double Cabs, with or without navigation and  Entune mobile apps.",

    "full_description": "For the 2011 4Runner, Toyota has dropped the underpowered four-cylinder engine from the lineup. Otherwise, the 4Runner remains unchanged. For the relatively few drivers who require an all-conquering, all-terrain SUV, the 2011 Toyota 4Runner is a top choice. Those city folk who need more passenger space and less off-road capability would be better served by a car-based crossover SUV. The 2011 Toyota 4Runner is, as it has always been, an  off-road SUV that is very well-mannered in the city. After a redesign last  year, the 4Runner returns mostly unchanged, with one notable exception: The  previously available inline-4 engine is no longer offered. Not that you're  going to be particularly broken up about this. The underpowered four-cylinder  struggled to propel the heavy 4Runner with much authority and offered a minimal  benefit in terms of real-world fuel economy.\nThis leaves the plenty powerful V6 as the sole engine choice  for the 2011 Toyota 4Runner. Besides ample horsepower and impressive off-road  prowess, the 4Runner counts a civilized driving demeanor and a spacious  interior among its other strengths.\nClimbing peaks and navigating treacherous terrain is what  the 4Runner is best at. Just like a traditional SUV, it features body-on-frame  construction and a solid rear axle suspension, although it also incorporates  the latest in off-road technology with Toyota's Kinetic Dynamic Suspension  System (KDSS), which can disconnect the front and rear stabilizer bars for  greater wheel articulation over rough terrain at speeds below 40 mph. Opting  for the Trail trim level further enhances the 4Runner's wilderness-taming  attitude with black-plastic fender flares and rocker panels (for easier and  less expensive replacement), a locking rear differential, hill-start assist and  hill-descent control, durable off-road tires and even water-resistant  upholstery.\nIt is worth mentioning that for the majority of SUV buyers  who rarely (if ever) take their vehicles off road, the 2011 Toyota 4Runner has  been outclassed by the flood of car-based crossover SUVs on the market, at  least as far as urban utility is concerned. Compared to the likes of the 2011 GMC Acadia, 2011 Hyundai Veracruz or even the 2011 Toyota  Highlander, the 4Runner lacks the on-road comfort and everyday practicality  that these vehicles provide. The 4Runner also lacks a V8 engine option, which  means choices like the 2011  Dodge Durango, Jeep Commander/Grand Cherokee and 2011 Nissan Pathfinder might be better for heavy towing duty. But in the end we have no hesitations  recommending the 2011 Toyota 4Runner as a jack-of-all-trades SUV. The 2011 Toyota 4Runner comes standard with a 4.0-liter V6 engine that produces 270 horsepower and 278 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed automatic is the only available transmission. The SR5 and Limited can be had in either rear-wheel or four-wheel drive (part-time dual-range system on SR5; full-time system on the Limited), while the Trail comes only with part-time dual-range 4WD. When properly equipped, the 4Runner's towing capacity tops out at 5,000 pounds.\nIn Edmunds instrumented testing, a rear-wheel-drive 4Runner SR5 accelerated from a standstill to 60 mph in 7.2 seconds, which is about average among competing SUVs. The EPA estimates 17 mpg city/23 mpg highway and 19 mpg combined for a rear-wheel-drive 4Runner, which is also average in this segment. A four-wheel-drive 4Runner gets 1 mpg less on the highway. Standard 4Runner safety features include antilock disc brakes (with brake assist), stability and traction control, active front head restraints, front knee airbags, front-seat side airbags and full-length, roll-sensing side curtain airbags.\nIn government crash tests, the 4Runner scores a perfect five out of five stars for driver protection in frontal collisions and four stars for the front passenger. Five stars have been awarded in side impact tests for both front and rear passengers. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awards its top rating of \"Good\" for both frontal offset and side-impact protection. In a recent test, a rear-wheel-drive 4Runner SR5 came to a stop from 60 mph in 122 feet, which is average among other SUVs in its class. Cruising around town, the 2011 Toyota 4Runner is surprisingly smooth and comfortable. Despite being built on a truck chassis, there is very little of the bouncy, over-sprung ride you expect from a body-on-frame vehicle capable of serious off-roading.\nOn the downside, the 4Runner's on-road handling limits are notably low, even for this class of vehicle. The steering feels disconnected and uncommunicative on the pavement, although this makes for less kickback on the trail, though its light-effort response at low speed also makes for easy maneuvering in parking lots.\nOff-road, the 4Runner performs very well, particularly if it's a Trail model fitted with KDSS. Though no V8 engine is offered, the standard V6 provides plenty of grunt and should be suitable for just about any driver. The 2011 Toyota 4Runner's interior features a geometric, industrial theme that supports this SUV's rugged image. Hard plastics are abundant throughout the cabin, though most touch points are lightly padded. The oversized climate control knobs underscore the 4Runner's utilitarian design, but have a wobbly feel when operated.\nThe Toyota 4Runner offers spacious seating for five passengers. The optional third-row seat increases the count to seven, though it's suitable only for small adults or children. With all seats folded flat, maximum cargo capacity is a useful 90 cubic feet. An optional sliding rear cargo deck can support up to 440 pounds. Tailgate partygoers will appreciate the optional Party Mode, which directs most of the audio system's sound to the speakers in the liftgate and increases bass response for a thumpin' good time. \nStandard features on the 4Runner SR5 include 17-inch cast-aluminum wheels, skid plates, heated outside mirrors with turn indicators and puddle lights, foglights, air-conditioning with rear ventilation, cruise control, full power accessories, a power rear window, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a trip computer and an eight-speaker CD/MP3 audio system with an auxiliary audio jack. The SR5 is available in either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive.\nThe 4Runner Trail level is only available as a 4WD model, and it supplements the SR5's equipment list with a hood scoop, black fender flares and rocker panels, a locking rear differential, Crawl Control (which electronically modulates throttle and brakes when ascending or descending hills), off-road-oriented tires, tinted head- and taillights, a sunroof, a back-up camera that displays in the rearview mirror, upgraded gauges, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, water-resistant upholstery, power front seats, a sliding rear cargo deck and an upgraded audio system with satellite radio, a USB port with iPod connectivity and Bluetooth phone and audio functions.\nThe Limited is available only with full-time all-wheel drive and includes 20-inch cast-aluminum wheels, Toyota's X-REAS adaptive suspension dampers, keyless entry and ignition, automatic headlights, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 15-speaker JBL audio system with a six-disc CD changer, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather upholstery, heated front seats and power lumbar support for the driver seat.\nMany of the features incorporated by the 4Runner Trail and Limited are available as options for the SR5 model, though specifics will vary based on the region of the U.S. in which you live. Other option highlights include a voice-activated navigation system and a third-row seat. The KDSS off-road suspension is available only on Trail models.",

    "full_description": "For 2011, the Toyota Camry Hybrid downgrades its former alloy wheels to steel ones with plastic covers. The 2011 Toyota Camry Hybrid is the rare hybrid that makes both environmental and financial sense. It's quicker than a regular four-cylinder Camry, it's far better on gas and it's only marginally more expensive than a comparable non-hybrid four-cylinder model. The attraction of hybrid vehicles has always been two-fold:  considerably higher fuel mileage and considerably less pollution than their  gasoline counterparts. Of course, there is a literal price to pay, as they usually cost quite a bit more than their fraternal  twins. The 2011 Toyota Camry Hybrid is the rare exception to that rule.\nThis roomy midsize sedan boasts an  impressive 34 combined mpg and runs so cleanly that it earns an Advanced  Technology Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (AT-PZEV) certification. And yet the  Camry Hybrid is hardly any more expensive than the top-of-the-line  four-cylinder Camry XLE. Better performance by virtue of its higher output (187  horsepower versus 169 hp) powerteam ices this green-frosted cake. To be fair,  the XLE does have a few more luxury features as standard, but the Hybrid still  comes with the ones you'll really need.\nAt low speeds (and while coasting  at higher speeds), the Camry Hybrid can run solely on electric power. At higher  driving speeds, the gas engine takes over. When maximum thrust is needed, such  as for climbing grades or swift passing and merging, the electric motor joins  the gas engine. These transitions are virtually seamless, and as such the Camry  Hybrid otherwise feels and drives like a standard Camry. That means a quiet  cabin, a comfortable ride and an isolated feel behind the wheel.\nIt's true that some consumers may  prefer a more engaging driving experience, and they'd be better served by the 2011 Ford Fusion Hybrid or the 2011 Nissan  Altima Hybrid. Another intriguing option will be Hyundai's all-new Sonata  Hybrid. Of course, one might also consider the 2011 Toyota Prius, which  gets you ample space for five and hatchback versatility, and the 2011 Chevrolet Volt and 2011 Nissan Leaf, two other  impressive green cars on the horizon. Overall, though, the 2011 Toyota Camry  Hybrid remains one of the better hybrid deals going, offering an enviable  combination of excellent fuel economy and traditional midsize sedan space and  comfort. The Camry Hybrid is powered by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder gas engine working in concert with an electric motor. Power is sent to the front wheels via a specialized continuously variable transmission (CVT). The gas engine produces 147 hp and 138 pound-feet of torque, and the electric motor adds another 40 hp, yielding 187 maximum hp. The Camry Hybrid can also run on electric power alone, but only under light throttle applications at speeds below 30 mph.With a respectable 8.4-second sprint from zero to 60 mph, the Camry Hybrid's acceleration falls between that of the four-cylinder and V6 non-hybrid Camrys, though it's closer to the four's. Fuel economy is an impressive 33 mpg city/34 mpg highway and 34 mpg combined. The 2011 Toyota Camry Hybrid features standard front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag, antilock disc brakes and stability control. In the government's new, more strenuous crash testing for 2011, the Camry Hybrid earned an overall rating of three stars out of a possible five, with three stars for overall frontal crash protection and three stars for overall side crash protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety also awarded the Camry its highest rating of \"Good\" for frontal offset and side collision protection. Driving the 2011 Toyota Camry Hybrid can be a bit odd due to the CVT, electric motor and eerily quiet cabin at traffic lights. Unlike many other hybrids, though, the Camry Hybrid offers relatively brisk acceleration, meaning you don't necessarily have to sacrifice performance for good fuel economy. While the Camry offers a smooth ride and quiet cabin, the flip side of that coin is lifeless steering and high-seas body roll; for most hybrid shoppers, though, these foibles are unlikely to be deal breakers. There's some visual interest in the Camry Hybrid's cabin, thanks largely to the ice-blue backlit trim on the center stack, but the general quality has slipped a bit relative to Camrys of old. Still, interior materials are adequate for a midsize sedan, and the car's inherent quietness combines with the hybrid powertrain's frequent electric-only silence to create a consistent impression of refinement. Comfy seats along with numerous cubbies and compartments make the hybrid's interior a thoroughly family-friendly environment. The hybrid system's battery packs eat into trunk space significantly (10.6 cubic feet versus 15 in the regular Camry), but a 60/40-split-folding rear seatback provides some added utility when needed. Bundled into various packages, Camry Hybrid options include a sunroof, 16-inch alloy wheels, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a four-way power passenger seat, a navigation system, satellite radio and a JBL sound system with a four-CD changer, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, a USB jack and satellite radio.",

    "full_description": "The 2018 Toyota Camry Hybrid is completely redesigned. Highlights include improved fuel economy, sleeker styling and additional standard safety features. Redesigned  for 2018, the Toyota Camry Hybrid has catapulted itself right up to the head of  its class with several significant upgrades.  High  fuel economy is the primary reason to buy a midsize hybrid, and this year's  Camry Hybrid is more efficient than ever. All Camry Hybrids use an updated  version of the same 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired to an electric motor.  But various tweaks provide a leap in fuel economy and a slight increase in  power. The base LE is now rated at 52 mpg combined (up 12 mpg from last year),  which is impressively the same mpg you get from Toyota's Prius. The slightly  less frugal SE and XLE post a 46 mpg combined rating.There's  also a new stylish look on the outside and several technology improvements. The  touchscreen has been updated with a 7-inch version of Toyota's Entune  interface, and advanced driver safety aids, such as adaptive cruise control and  forward collision mitigation, are now standard equipment. Underneath, the 2018  Camry Hybrid gets new suspension, which means a smoother ride over broken city  streets, a big plus for such a city-friendly sedan. The  2018 Camry Hybrid has a few drawbacks stemming from its Entune infotainment  interface and drivability, but this new model is certainly an improvement over  last year's model. We definitely recommend taking one out for a test drive to  see the difference for yourself. Notably, we picked the 2018 Toyota Camry Hybrid as one of Edmunds' Best Hybrid Cars for this year. The redesigned 2018 Camry Hybrid is a great choice if you're shopping for a hybrid sedan. Though there are some missteps with in-car technology, they are greatly outweighed by the Camry Hybrid's combination of excellent fuel economy, smooth driving demeanor and stylish appearance. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the2018  Toyota Camry LE Hybrid (2.5L 4-cyl hybrid | CVT automatic | FWD). While 208 combined horsepower might not look too impressive on paper, the Camry Hybrid has more than adequate real-world performance. Passing and merging with traffic are never a concern, and its recorded 0-60-mph time of 7.5 seconds even makes it a tad quicker than a regular four-cylinder Camry. The brakes are a mixed bag. Under most conditions they feel smooth and predictable, but the transition between regen and mechanical braking becomes clumsy in stop-and-go traffic. Panic-braking performance is diminished by the low-rolling-resistance tires; our test stop from 60 mph covered 128 feet. The steering is accurate, and the ratio is quick enough to make low-speed maneuvers a breeze. But there's an overabundance of power assist, so the steering is light and gives you little feel for the road. It's well-mannered within its modest limits since the tires don't have much grip. Still, the Hybrid feels tidy for a car in this class. Body roll isn't excessive when you're going around turns, though the Camry bobs up and down on bumpy, twisting roads more than we'd like. In most situations, you'd be hard-pressed to tell this Camry is a hybrid. The gasoline engine is quiet and quick to rev, and the CVT blends electric and gasoline power with ease and efficiency. Continuously variable gearing helps the cruise control hold speed within 5 mph on downgrades. On first inspection the seats don't look to be anything special, but they do a good job accommodating different body types. The seats are somewhat wide and somewhat flat, providing no pain points, and it's easy to get comfortable and stay comfortable. And the LE-level cloth breathes well. The Camry Hybrid LE excels around town, soaking up bumps and broken surfaces with its long travel suspension and generous tire sidewalls. At highway speeds, however, the rear can sometimes feel soft and buoyant. It's not quite floaty, but it's close. Electric takeoffs are, of course, silent, and the engine is less obvious because it joins in later \u2014 though you will hear it zing under heavy throttle application. There's not much in the way of wind or road noise, no matter the speed. Clear and easily understood controls, along with good vent positioning, make for set-and-forget operation. And the system handles triple-digit temperatures well, even though it feels slow to get going at startup when we wanted cold air ASAP. There's nothing confusing about the inside of the new Toyota Camry, with the possible exception of all the acronyms for the safety systems. On-screen menus are easy enough to decipher with one or two uses, and the instrumentation is very legible and efficient with information. Generous door openings front and rear mean easy access for most everyone. All the seats are unobstructed by any part of the car, and headroom is never an issue when entering or exiting the vehicle. The seats are an inch lower than in the old car, so it's not as level getting in or out. This interior is very adaptable, and our drivers were all quick to find a comfortable driving position. The pedal box is roomy, and the steering wheel has a large degree of usable adjustment. Arms and elbows can find comfortable, padded support or are free to move when turning. Front and rear passengers have ample space around them. Taller drivers won't impinge on rear passenger legroom, and headroom for the rear seat is ample. The front of the cabin is airy and spacious. There's a large greenhouse on the new Camry and it makes visibility in every direction quite good. Mirrors, both inside and out, are nicely sized, and blind spots are kept to a minimum. The standard rearview camera is a plus. The vehicle tested was a preproduction model, but the fit and finish is on par with what we expect of Toyota. The interior is a nice step up from the last generation with quality materials and is well assembled. The doors did seem to sound a little hollow but did not rattle or feel cheap. Good but not stellar cabin storage. The forward center console bin is great for concealing items, but it has a hard, slippery floor so items slide around noisily. The console bin at your elbow is a decent size. The modest door pockets in the front and rear are good for small water bottles only. Thanks to a relocated battery pack, there's no longer any intrusion by the pack into the Camry Hybrid's cargo space \u2014 it's the same as any other Camry. And the Hybrid's rear seats fold to expand trunk space even more. Plus, the trunk has a generous opening and a low liftover height. Very easy to mount a car seat, with obvious and easily accessible lower anchors and package tray-mounted tether points, both under plastic covers. There's enough space so that the front seat need not be scooted all the way forward. The layout of the audio system is simple, and it looks good, too. But Hybrid buyers must use Toyota's favored Scout GPS Link app (free three-year trial) when their phone is connected via the Entune app. We suspect many will instead use their phone directly. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not available, but once your phone has the Entune app, connection is seamless and immediate. Some apps require the phone to be connected with a USB cable. Wireless charging is on offer, but if your phone is always plugged in for Entune it seems a bit pointless. All Camrys come with adaptive cruise, automatic emergency braking and lane keeping assist. Our Hybrid also had optional rear cross-traffic alert/braking, intelligent clearance sonar and blind-spot monitoring. The lane departure warning was annoying on very narrow roads because it has no off button. Voice controls through the Entune app suite are fairly straightforward and made all the more effective when you follow the voice command setup menu that helps analyze your speech patterns. Siri Eyes Free and Google Voice are also supported. In-car 4G LTE Wi-Fi is available and offered free of charge for the first six months for data up to 2 GB. For  the 2018 Camry Hybrid, we recommend the base LE trim level. It comes with plenty of standard equipment,  including advanced safety features such as adaptive cruise control, and it has  the higher 52 mpg combined fuel economy rating. If you want more features,  stand-alone options such as Entune Audio Plus and a sunroof are available on  the base LE, so we see little need to pay more for the SE or XLE. The LE starts off with features such as  16-inch steel wheels, automatic LED headlights, keyless ignition and entry, a  rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable driver  seat (with power lumbar adjustment), heated front seats, adaptive cruise  control, forward collision mitigation with pedestrian detection, a rearview  camera, lane departure warning and mitigation, and Toyota's Entune Audio  interface. Entune Audio includes a 7-inch touchscreen display, voice controls,  a USB port, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player and an auxiliary  audio jack. Right  in the middle of the lineup is the SE that adds 18-inch alloy wheels, sport-themed styling details, a rear spoiler,  simulated leather upholstery (with fabric inserts), and a leather-wrapped  steering wheel with shift paddles.The XLE Hybrid gets all of the base LE's  equipment plus unique 18-inch alloy wheels, an auto-dimming rearview mirror,  leather upholstery, a power-adjustable passenger seat, wireless smartphone  charging, a head-up driver display, two extra USB ports, blind-spot monitoring  with rear cross-traffic alert, and heated exterior mirrors.Entune  Audio Plus is optional on all three trim levels and it adds an 8-inch  touchscreen, a smartphone-based navigation app, wireless smartphone charging, a  4G LTE connection with a Wi-Fi hotspot, Toyota Safety Connect, and a  nine-speaker audio system with satellite radio and HD radio. The LE and SE can  be equipped with the blind-spot monitoring and rear-cross traffic alert as  extras, and the XLE is available with automatic high-beam headlights and a  top-down parking camera system. All three trim levels can be had with a  sunroof.",

    "full_description": "Combining comfort, quality and  impressive fuel economy, the 2018 Toyota Avalon ranks among the best large  sedans on the market. A cushioned ride and hushed cabin make the Avalon  well-suited for commutes and road trips, and its roomy interior offers plenty  of room to spread out. It even offers a dash of speed and performance that  befits its mission as a deluxe daily shuttle.  Starting  with a well-equipped base model, the Avalon offers a long list of desirable  standard features, including a V6 engine, leather upholstery, heated seats and  several driver assistance features. From there you can opt into progressively  more full-featured models with navigation, enhanced audio and luxury creature  comforts such as heated rear seats, upgraded leather and rear-seat climate  controls. For  such a large and roomy car, the Avalon returns surprisingly good fuel economy.  On our evaluation test loop, the Avalon returned 28.6 mpg, well above its EPA  rating. In the remaining miles of mixed driving, we observed 24 mpg - right on the money with its EPA combined mpg rating. More impressive is that  this comes from a car with a large V6 engine that generates 268 horsepower and  helps the car accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds. The Avalon is no  sport sedan, but an available Touring trim with larger wheels and tighter  suspension tuning delivers more enhanced performance. Overall,  we recommend the 2018 Avalon. While there are some other solid choices  available for a big sedan, including the Chevrolet Impala, Kia Cadenza and  Nissan Maxima, the Toyota Avalon continues to be a standout.Notably, we picked the 2018 Toyota Avalon as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars, Trucks and SUVs. Combining comfort, quality and impressive fuel economy, the 2018 Toyota Avalon ranks among the best large sedans on the market. A cushioned ride and hushed cabin make the Avalon well-suited for commutes and road trips, and its roomy interior offers plenty of room to spread out. It's a standout. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although  trim levels share many aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our  full test of the 2017 Toyota Avalon  Limited (3.5-liter V6 | 6-speed automatic | FWD). The Avalon's big V6 has plenty of power for passing and merging; it will even spin the wheels if the traction control is off. The gas pedal is responsive, but the sluggish transmission can be a wet blanket. We measured a 0-60-mph time of 6.5 seconds, which is respectable for a large family sedan. While the pedal feels soft underfoot, brake response is sure and linear, so it's easy to make buttery smooth stops without upsetting your passengers. Our panic-stop test from 60 mph was average, but it earned bonus points for consistent performance over repeated stops. The Avalon's steering is light, and there isn't much on-center feel. Even so, there's more feedback than we expected once we initiated turns, and this gave us a fairly good idea of how hard the front tires were working and how much more they could take. In the realm of routine street driving, the Avalon feels reassuringly neutral and tidy. But a tight on-ramp or winding mountain road can expose understeer and a nose-heavy feel that gives the impression that the suspension calibration is too soft for anyone who likes a sporty-handling sedan. Highway cruising is the Avalon's forte. The transmission shifts agreeably and is generally quite smooth, but it can come across as sluggish if called upon to react quickly or drop more than one gear, as when passing slow trucks while going up a grade. Selecting Sport mode helps in these instances. The front seats are somewhat flat, but they're supportive and comfy thanks to their softness; you sink into them. Adjustable lumbar support is effective. But the rear seats are flatter and have less give. They're not as comfortable as the fronts on long drives. This is the plush, cloudlike ride that interstate drivers long for. It's softly sprung. Bumpy roads can overwhelm the suspension, though, and the Avalon can get a bit too floaty. The Avalon is commendably quiet and especially well-insulated against wind and engine noise. A little tire and road noise remains, but it's minor. Against this quiet backdrop we actually noticed that cornering made the owner's manual clunk around inside the glovebox, which has an unlined interior. The tri-zone system is effective and easy to use. It takes a second to spool up but easily cools the cabin on hot days. But you can't control the rear zone from the front. Front and outer rear passengers get heated seats. The ventilation in the front seats is all noise with little effect. Most primary controls and secondary switches are well-marked. But the steering wheel blocks the view of the volume knob and some crucial buttons to the left of the touchscreen. These buttons are touch-sensitive, but they offer no tactile feedback so you must look to see where your fingers are going. The Avalon features large door apertures all around and slim rocker overhangs. The doors themselves are slim, and they stay open with mild friction. Rear passengers have it even easier, thanks to a wide seat bottom and a seatback that's aligned with the rear door jamb instead of being set back. The seats have a good deal of adjustment and can accommodate both sit-up and more reclined drivers. But some taller drivers may have a hard time finding the ideal driving position, not because of the seats but because the telescopic steering mechanism has a limited range of extension. This car provides ample space, front and rear, for a long road trip. Everyone enjoys great leg- and headroom and elbow room. The only potential drawback we can see is slightly limited toe room in the rear seat if the corresponding front seat is set to its lowest height. Visibility toward the front half of the car is good, and rear visibility is satisfactory. The side mirrors are small for such a full-size sedan, making blind-spot monitoring a necessity rather than a convenience. Toyota went to great effort to optimize materials and their placement to ensure drivers and passengers are always next to, or interfacing with, the good stuff. But cheaper materials do appear in the dim recesses if you go looking for it. Still, the construction and build quality are excellent. Front door pockets are small and can't hold bottles. The center console has a moderately large cargo box with a removable second-level tray. A retractable Qi charging platform sits in front of the shifter. Rear seats have even smaller door pockets, with cupholders in the fold-down armrest. Although the rear seats don't fold down, the generous 16-cubic-foot trunk volume does not disappoint. A wide trunk opening allows easy access, and the liftover height is average, with a mild drop down to the floor. A central pass-through between the rear seats is provided for long, skinny items. LATCH anchors are easy to grasp but difficult to engage due to the seat material that surrounds it. Upper LATCH points are easy to access. Generous rear kneeroom means you don't have to scoot the front seats up much when installing a bulky rear-facing seat. The JBL audio system is effective at pop vocals, but with a mildly muted midbass area you may find yourself raising the volume on rock, jazz and classical. Navigation maps are built in and don't require a paired phone. The lack of direct access to maps is a minus; you have to hit \"Home\" first. Phone connectivity is excellent and quick. The Bluetooth system works great, and if you have a modern phone, you can even search individual albums and playlists. There's also a USB and auxiliary-in jack up front underneath the Qi induction charger. It comes standard with automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assistance and adaptive cruise control, but the latter does not function below about 30 mph. Passive equipment includes lane departure warning, front and rear parking sensors, and a relatively low-resolution, rear-facing camera. Toyota's voice control is adequate so long as you understand its syntax and follow it accordingly. Voice control works for using navigation and the radio and passing voice commands to your smartphone. You can also call up certain apps and weather information. Loaded  with convenience and safety features, a sunroof and a well-crafted interior,  the 2018 Toyota Avalon XLE Plus offers the best bang for the buck. The base XLE also makes a fine choice as it  offers the most XLE Plus features, minus the sunroof, for less money. Upgraded  leather and other luxurylike touches make the Limited a top pick if cost isn't  an issue, while the Touring is a sportier option. With all of the Avalon's  standard equipment, however, the XLE Plus or base XLE is hard to beat. The XLE is  well-equipped for a base trim and feels expertly assembled. A 3.5-liter V6  engine (268 horsepower, 248 pound-feet of torque) and six-speed automatic transmission  come standard, as do 17-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control,  a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, leather upholstery, and  heated and power-adjustable front seats. Additional conveniences include  keyless ignition and entry, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen  with Toyota's Entune interface and voice controls, and an eight-speaker audio  system. Toyota's Safety Sense package also comes standard and includes  automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning (with  pedestrian detection), automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and  lane keeping assist.The XLE Plus adds a sunroof and an  auto-dimming rearview mirror.The XLE Premium offers more significant  upgrades such as driver-seat memory settings, a wireless smartphone charging  pad, navigation, a nine-speaker audio system, smartphone app integration,  blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.The Touring trim  is best for those seeking a measure of sport since it comes with 18-inch  wheels, LED headlights and taillights, a sport-tuned suspension and unique interior trim.The Limited bundles the same features from the Touring trim (minus the interior accents)  along with xenon headlights, auto-dimming side mirrors, automatic wipers,  ambient cabin lighting, tri-zone automatic climate control, upgraded leather  upholstery, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a rear power sunshade, Safety  Connect emergency notification and roadside assistance services, and an 11-speaker JBL  premium sound system.",

    "full_description": "For 2014, the Toyota Sienna is essentially unchanged apart from the tow prep package becoming standard across the board and the SE trim now offering a blind spot monitoring system as an individual option (it previously required the purchase of an option package). Roomy, comfortable, well-built and offered in several different trim levels, the 2014 Toyota Sienna minivan is an excellent choice for larger families.Notably, we picked the 2014 Toyota Sienna as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars, Trucks and SUVs. There's just no getting around the fact that a box on wheels is the most space-efficient vehicle for moving people and cargo. As such, minivans, although not the flashiest things on the road, make the best family haulers. And among these amiable beasts of burden, the 2014 Toyota Sienna stands out as a top choice. \nAs with its peers, the Sienna provides a spacious interior as well as plenty of available luxury features. As you'd expect, there are the well-equipped base and loaded-up luxury versions. But there's also the SE version, which boasts something rare in this segment: a sporty personality via its firmer suspension tuning, along with some bolder styling tweaks that do their best to make the minivan look cool. It's a nice complement to the Sienna's V6 engine, which is one of the strongest you'll find in this class.\nToyota's minivan can also carry up to eight passengers, and it can be optioned with all-wheel drive -- the Sienna is actually the only 2014 minivan available with AWD and it's a boon if you frequently slog through snow. Of course, the Sienna isn't the only impressive choice for a minivan. The 2014 Honda Odyssey is also one of our favorites and boasts minor advantages in fuel efficiency and second-row seating versatility.\nAlso worth considering are the more affordable 2014 Dodge Grand Caravan and the off-beat 2014 Nissan Quest; both offer ultra-convenient fold-flat second- and third-row seating arrangements. But among this box-on-wheels group, the 2014 Toyota Sienna is still very easy to recommend given its combination of performance, space and features. Every Toyota Sienna comes with a 3.5-liter V6 engine that delivers 266 horsepower and 245 pound-feet of torque and drives the front wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission. The Sienna LE, XLE and Limited models can also be equipped with all-wheel drive.\nIn Edmunds testing, we timed a front-drive Sienna Limited from zero to 60 mph in a swift 7.5 seconds. The EPA fuel economy estimates come in at 21 mpg combined (18 mpg city/25 mpg highway) for front-wheel-drive versions. Opting for all-wheel drive drops those estimates to 19 mpg combined (16 mpg city/23 mpg highway). Antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, a driver-side knee airbag and active front head restraints are standard on all 2014 Toyota Sienna models. A rearview camera, a blind spot monitoring system and front and rear parking sensors are available depending on the trim level, while the Limited can be had with a forward collision warning system. At our test track, a Sienna Limited stopped from 60 mph in 127 feet -- about average for the minivan segment.\nIn government crash testing, the Sienna received an overall score of four stars out of five, with three stars for overall frontal crash protection and five stars for overall side crash protection. In tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Sienna earned a top score of \"Good\" for its performance in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and roof-strength tests. It also earned a \"Good\" rating for its seat/head restraint design's whiplash protection in rear impacts.  We've long been impressed with the Sienna's V6 engine, which has the juice to deliver lively acceleration whether you're bopping around town running errands or getting up to cruising speed on the freeway. The smart six-speed automatic transmission does a great job at keeping the thrust on tap, yet the Sienna still manages to provide respectable fuel economy provided you're not too aggressive with the gas pedal.\nThe 2014 Toyota Sienna's ride quality is plush, and all versions offer competent handling. The SE's recalibrated suspension gives it even more agility around turns, albeit with a somewhat firmer (though still comfortable) ride quality. The steering in most Siennas is precise and light in effort (but low on feedback and not especially sporty), while the SE offers a meatier feel to its steering action in keeping with its more athletic character. Lower trim levels of the Sienna are attractively decked out with high-quality fabric upholstery, while higher-end models get leather along with simulated wood cabin accents. Some of the interior plastics feel a bit downmarket, though, while others -- such as the intentionally coarse-textured plastic on the dash -- are just plain odd. Seating is plush, though, and there's abundant storage space along with user-friendly controls.\nOn the electronics front, the Sienna's available navigation system includes Entune, a suite of smartphone-connected services that includes features like the Bing search engine, Pandora streaming radio, and real-time traffic, sports and stock information. The touchscreen interface is pretty easy to use, but sometimes the virtual buttons' delayed response to touch inputs can be frustrating. The long reach from the driver seat to the center console's controls can also be problematic. The available rear-seat entertainment system features a split-screen monitor that allows two different media (a movie on one side and a video game on the other, for example) to play simultaneously -- thereby making it easier to keep the peace in the backseat.\nWith a seven-passenger Sienna, you get second-row captain's chairs that tip forward to allow easier access to the third row; these chairs also have a long-slide feature to maximize legroom for taller passengers. However, the seats require a fair amount of effort to slide, and removing them is a job best left to two people, as they are rather heavy and awkward. The eight-passenger Sienna comes with a 40/20/40-split second-row bench, and its center section slides close to the front seats for easier access to the little ones seated there.\nIf you choose a Sienna Limited with its lounge seats, the second-row passengers get to recline in La-Z-Boy-style comfort, provided the seats are positioned back far enough (and the front seats are up far enough) to allow the built-in footrests to rise all the way up. With the second-row seats removed and the third row stowed, the Sienna provides a massive 150 cubic feet of maximum cargo capacity. \nThe Sienna L includes 17-inch alloy wheels, a tow prep package, manual sliding rear doors, triple-zone air-conditioning, full power accessories, a telescoping steering wheel, cruise control and a four-speaker sound system with a CD player and an auxiliary audio jack.\nThe LE adds roof rails, power-sliding side doors, a power liftgate, privacy glass, heated outside mirrors, floor- and overhead-mounted consoles, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, triple-zone automatic climate control, an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar support), second- and third-row sunshades, a 3.5-inch infotainment display, a rearview camera, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, and a six-speaker sound system with satellite radio and an iPod/USB interface.\nThe sport-themed SE is equipped similarly to the LE but adds more aggressive styling thanks to 19-inch alloy wheels, a unique front fascia (with foglights, mesh inserts and a larger air intake), lower-body skirting and tinted head- and taillights. The SE also has firmer suspension tuning and revised power steering. Inside the SE are leatherette/cloth upholstery, unique instruments and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\nThe Sienna XLE adds a number of luxury features to the LE's list of amenities, including a unique metallic-gray grille insert, automatic headlights, a sunroof, an acoustic windshield, a blind spot monitoring system, leather upholstery, wood-grain interior trim, premium instrumentation, heated front seats, a four-way power front passenger seat and power-opening rear quarter windows. \nThe plush Limited features 18-inch alloy wheels, a satin chrome grille, auto-dimming outside mirrors, dual sunroofs, front and rear parking sensors, keyless ignition/entry, two-tone leather seating, driver memory settings, a leather-and-wood steering wheel, an upgraded 10-speaker JBL surround-sound audio system, second-row lounge-style seats and a power-split-folding third-row seat.\nAlthough some of the upper trims' features are available on lower trims as individual options, most optional features are grouped into packages that vary based on trim level and where you live in the U.S. Other notable highlights include a rear-seat DVD entertainment system (with a large screen that can be split to display two different sources) and a navigation system with a 6.1-inch display, Entune smartphone app integration and a rearview camera. For the Sienna Limited only, Toyota offers xenon headlights with automatic high-beam control and adaptive cruise control with a forward collision warning system.",

    "full_description": "The Toyota Camry receives a thorough overhaul for 2015, a mere three years after a complete redesign. Highlights include all-new exterior styling, improved handling and a revised interior with more equipment and better materials. With its improvements to cabin quality and handling, the 2015 Toyota Camry is a more compelling and competitive midsize sedan that still boasts generous interior space and a solid reputation for reliability. The generational lifecycle of Toyota cars and trucks is usually very  consistent. Every five or six years, the company typically debuts a new version  of a given car and, apart from some mild updates of a chrome strip here or a reshaped  headlight design there, leaves it alone until the next redesign. The 2015  Toyota Camry represents a significant departure from the norm, however, as  Toyota has thoroughly overhauled it a mere three years after a complete  redesign. Whatever the reasons are for the change -- a good guess would be that  Toyota feels the need to have a more competitive Camry this year -- the end  result is certainly good news if you're shopping for a 2015 midsize family  sedan.\nThe Camry's changes are obvious on the outside, where all  but the roof has been restyled. The grille is bigger, more prominent and  indicative of the pricier Toyota Avalon and its Lexus corporate cousins. In profile, the Camry is more sculpted and less slablike,  and the car's rear styling has been smoothed out. Overall, we think the Camry  looks more refined, premium and grown up. Inside, the Camry's overall design and  generous passenger space remain unchanged, but Toyota has improved the quality  of plastics -- especially on the center console -- while most of the door  panels are now covered in padded simulated leather or suede (depending on the trim  level). The buttons and knobs for the climate controls are bigger and less  toylike than before and, as a result, are not only easier to use but imbue a  higher-end look and feel. Plus, every Camry now gets classier gauges and a  user-friendly Entune touchscreen interface.\nThe four-cylinder and V6 engines remain unchanged, but Toyota  did make significant improvements to the Camry's body structure and suspension tuning.  The result is a more buttoned-down, confident driving experience that Toyota  says its customers have been requesting. This latest Camry still isn't what we  would call a sporty family sedan like a Mazda 6 or Ford Fusion, but it is more  responsive and generally better to drive. \nThat also applies to the popular SE trim, which not only  dials up the driving engagement factor further but also boasts more aggressive  styling cues. For 2015, though, it is joined by an XSE trim that for the first  time allows customers to pair the SE's visual and suspension enhancements with  the more luxurious XLE's greater comfort and convenience features. This  provides a greater amount of customer choice and creates two distinct flavors  of Camry that makes it stand out in the family sedan segment.\nIndeed, standing out is something that the Camry has not  done in a very long time. If anything, its previously so-so interior quality  and forgettable driving experience made it stand out from top-rated family  sedans like the Ford Fusion, Honda  Accord, Mazda 6 and Nissan  Altima in a negative way. The 2015 Toyota Camry, however, corrects many of  its previous deficiencies, adds a little more verve and, although we wouldn't  go so far as to proclaim it the class leader, places it squarely within the  best-in-class pack. Every 2015 Toyota Camry trim comes standard with a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine that produces 178 horsepower and 170 pound-feet of torque.  Front-wheel drive and a six-speed automatic transmission are standard. \nIn Edmunds testing, a Camry LE with that powertrain went  from zero to 60 mph in 8.3 seconds. EPA-estimated  fuel economy is 28 mpg  combined (25 city/35 highway), which is at least 2 mpg fewer than its main  competitors.\nThe Camry XSE and XLE can be equipped with a 3.5-liter V6  that produces 268 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. It too has front-wheel drive and  a six-speed automatic. A Camry XLE V6 sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 6.2  seconds, making it one of the quickest cars in the class. Its EPA-estimated  fuel economy of 25 mpg  combined (21/31) is on par with its competitors. Every 2015 Toyota Camry comes standard with antilock disc  brakes, stability and traction control, front and rear side airbags, front and  rear side curtain airbags, front knee airbags and a rearview camera. \nOptions on the XSE and XLE include a blind-spot warning  system paired with a rear cross traffic alert system. The Advanced Technology  package adds a lane-departure warning system and a pre-collision system that  uses the adaptive cruise control sensors to anticipate an accident, warn the  driver and brake if need be to prevent or mitigate an accident. Optional only  on the XLE is Safety Connect,  which adds automatic collision notification, an emergency assist button and a  stolen-vehicle locator.\nIn government crash  testing, the Camry received five  out of five stars for overall crash protection, with four stars for  frontal-impact protection and five stars for side-impact protection. The  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Camry its best  possible rating of \"Good\" in its moderate-overlap and  small-overlap frontal-offset impact tests. The Camry also earned a  \"Good\" score in the side-impact, roof-strength and head restraint/seatbelts  (whiplash protection) tests. With improvements made to its body structure, suspension and  steering, every 2015 Toyota Camry is more responsive than the previous versions  to driver inputs and more composed when going around turns. This is especially  true of the SE and XSE trims, which dial up the driver engagement even further.  True, they don't quite reach the same level of sharpness offered  by sportier competitors like the Mazda 6. But that's quite all right as these  popular trim levels simply feel like a modern family sedan should when you're behind  the wheel, feeling like neither a would-be sport sedan nor, on the other end of  the spectrum, a big rolling couch.\u00a0 \nBoth the base 2.5-liter four-cylinder and optional 3.5-liter  V6 engines deliver satisfying acceleration in a smooth fashion. Transmission  downshifts are commendably responsive, which is noteworthy given that some  rivals' automatic transmissions are lethargic in this regard for the sake of  fuel economy.  The 2015 Toyota Camry is blessed with one of the most  comfortable and spacious cabins in the midsize family sedan segment. Even tall  adults will find plenty of space above their heads and in front of their knees,  while a rear-facing child seat will fit in back with ease. The fixed rear  headrests make it difficult to properly secure a front-facing child seat,  though. Space in the trunk, at 15.4 cubic feet, is average for a midsize sedan. \nIn terms of controls, the center stack's buttons are big,  easy to read at a glance and glove-friendly without being comically large or  ugly. This is especially true of the sensibly designed climate controls. Every  Camry gets a standard 6.1-inch Entune touchscreen interface, which controls the  audio system, available smartphone-integrated apps and the optional navigation  system. We would deem very few of these modern interfaces to be truly  user-friendly, but Entune is one of the better and simpler ones available.  \nStandard equipment on the base LE includes 16-inch steel  wheels, automatic headlights, heated mirrors, air-conditioning, keyless entry,  a rearview camera, cruise control, an eight-way power driver seat (with two-way  power lumbar adjustment), a 60/40-split folding rear seat, cloth upholstery,  Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a 6.1-inch Entune touchscreen  electronics interface, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, an  auxiliary audio jack and a USB/iPod interface.\nThe SE builds upon that with 17-inch alloy wheels, a  sport-tuned suspension, unique exterior styling and interior trim elements,  sport fabric and simulated leather upholstery, a leather-trimmed steering wheel  and upgraded gauges. \nSatellite radio, HD radio and a color trip computer display can  be added to the LE and SE as part of the Entune Plus package. A sunroof is also  optional.\nThe XSE builds upon the SE's equipment with 18-inch alloy  wheels, LED running lamps, leather and simulated suede upholstery, heated front  seats with more aggressive side bolstering, a four-way power passenger seat,  dual-zone automatic climate control, satellite radio and HD radio. \nThe Convenience package available on the four-cylinder SE  and XSE trims includes keyless ignition and entry, and an auto-dimming rearview  mirror.\nThe XLE is equipped similarly to the XSE, however, it has  the LE's more comfort-oriented suspension tuning and lacks the SE/XSE's sporty  styling elements. It has 17-inch alloy wheels and full leather upholstery.\nThe following items are optional on the four-cylinder XSE  and XLE and standard on their V6-powered versions: LED headlights, a  noise-reducing windshield, a sunroof, the Convenience package items, a 7-inch  upgraded Entune touchscreen interface, a navigation system, Qi wireless  smartphone charging and a suite of smartphone-integration apps.\nOptional on the XSE and the XLE is a blind-spot monitoring  and rear cross-traffic alert system, the Advanced Technology package  (lane-departure warning, adaptive cruise control, a pre-collision warning and  braking system, and automatic high beam headlight control), and a 10-speaker  JBL sound system.\nThe XLE can be equipped with Safety Connect emergency  telematics (see Safety section).",

With its combination of comfort, overall quality and solid performance, the 2016 Toyota Avalon is one of the best full-size sedans on the market.Notably, we picked the 2016 Toyota Avalon as one of Edmunds' Best Used Cars, Trucks and SUVs. The criteria for a solid full-size sedan these days are  pretty straightforward: a roomy cabin, a long list of creature comforts and a  quiet, controlled ride. Those expectations are apparently tattooed on the arms of  every 2016 Toyota Avalon engineer, because the latest version fulfills those  needs and then some.\nThe vast, airy cabin affords more than enough room for  passengers front and rear. There's also Lexus-like wood and soft-touch plastic  trim, while the supremely comfortable seats are perfect for long-distance  cruising. Noise from the road, wind and tires is practically nonexistent. Luxurious  features, including ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, tri-zone  automatic climate control and a power rear sunshade are all available.\n\nUnderstating styling is  a hallmark of the Avalon, but under that skin is a sophisticated sedan with a  luxurious interior.\nEven though the Avalon offers a comprehensive set of features  along with satisfying performance, there are a few competitors worth  considering. Although it's a bit smaller on the inside, the 2016 Nissan  Maxima is fun to drive and the cabin design is more modern. The 2016 Kia Cadenza offers goodies not available in the Avalon, including a panoramic sunroof and  adaptive headlights. The 2016 Chrysler 300 offers all-wheel drive for cold-weather traction or an optional 363-horsepower  V8 for more spirited performance. Other standouts in the category include the 2016  Chevrolet Impala and 2016 Hyundai  Azera. The 2016 Toyota Avalon comes with a 3.5-liter V6 engine that  produces 268 hp and 248 pound-feet of torque. Power is sent to the front wheels  through a six-speed automatic transmission.\nIn Edmunds testing, an Avalon XLE sprinted from zero to 60  mph in 6.4 seconds, making it one of the quicker cars in its segment.\n\nThe Touring version of  the Avalon features unique interior trim along with a sport-tuned suspension. Standard safety features for the 2016 Toyota Avalon include  traction and stability control, antilock disc brakes, front and rear seat side  airbags, side curtain airbags, front knee airbags and a rearview camera. The XLE  Premium, Touring and Limited come with blind spot monitoring systems with rear  cross-traffic alert. Also standard on the Limited is Toyota's Safety Connect  service, which includes roadside assistance, stolen vehicle location and  automatic collision notification. The Limited's optional Toyota Safety Sense  package includes a frontal collision warning system, automatic pre-collision  braking and lane-keeping assist.\nIn our testing, an Avalon XLE came to a stop from 60 mph in  127 feet, a few feet longer than the class average.\nIn government crash tests, the Avalon received five  stars for overall crash protection. In testing by the Insurance Institute  for Highway Safety, the Avalon scored a \"Good\"  rating: \u00a0the highest possible. The  Avalon's seat and head restraint design was also rated \"Good\" for  whiplash protection in rear impacts. The 2016 Toyota Avalon's V6 engine is smooth and powerful  and should provide more than enough punch to please most drivers. Furthermore,  that performance is delivered in a very quiet, unruffled manner, which adds to  the Toyota's appeal as an effortless open highway cruiser. The Avalon exhibits  a slight amount of body roll through corners, but overall it is surprisingly  composed when the road gets twisty.\nAt its core, the Avalon provides an impressive blend of  comfort, performance and efficiency. It's also just plain easy to drive. The  ride quality is firmer than that of Avalons of old, though, so if you're coming  out of an older Avalon, make sure you give this new car a thorough test-drive. The Avalon's interior is spacious and elegant, with  high-quality materials throughout. The front seats are very comfortable, with  plenty of side bolstering and lumbar support for both the driver and the front  passenger. As with most cars in this class, the Avalon's rear seat is quite  roomy. The cavernous trunk offers 16 cubic feet of space, and its wide opening  and low liftover height make it easy to load heavy bags.\n\nTop-notch materials  combined with a sleek design give the Avalon the look and feel of a luxury car.\nAll Avalons come standard with a 7-inch touchscreen, Toyota's\u00a0Entune infotainment system and iPhone  integration with Siri Eyes-Free. The Entune system was updated last year to  include swipe capability, a customizable home screen, voice recognition and  cache radio that can rewind up to 20 minutes.\nStorage cubbies provide ample room for keys and wallets, and  the center console is large. The front section of the center console acts as a  convenient \"eBin,\" with power cords passing through a sliding panel  for two cell phones and auxiliary and USB connections. This area is also home  to the available Qi wireless charging system. We like its convenience, but it  doesn't charge very quickly. \nThe base XLE comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels,  automatic headlights, LED taillights, heated mirrors, dual-zone automatic  climate control, cruise control, a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel with wheel-mounted paddle shifters, leather upholstery, heated  front seats, an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar support) and a  four-way power front passenger seat. Electronics features include keyless  ignition and entry, a rearview camera, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity,  a 7-inch touchscreen with Toyota's Entune interface with voice controls  (including Siri Eyes-Free for iPhone users) and an eight-speaker audio system  with a CD player, satellite radio, HD radio, a USB port and an auxiliary audio  jack.\n\nLike most sedans in its segment,  the Avalon offers exceptional rear seat comfort and a sizable trunk.\nUpgrading to the XLE Plus adds additional functionality to  the keyless entry system, a sunroof and  an auto-dimming rearview mirror. \nThe XLE Premium steps it up another notch with driver memory  settings, Qi wireless charging, navigation,  a nine-speaker audio system, smartphone app integration, blind spot monitoring  and rear cross-traffic detection.\nThe Touring comes with 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and  taillights, a sport-tuned suspension and unique interior trim.\nWith the top-of-the-line Avalon Limited you get equipment  from the Touring trim (minus the interior accents) in addition to xenon  headlights, auto-dimming side mirrors with puddle lamps, automatic wipers,  ambient cabin lighting, tri-zone automatic climate control, upgraded leather  upholstery, ventilated front seats, a 10-way power-adjustable driver seat,  eight-way power-adjustable front passenger seat, heated rear seats, a rear  power sunshade, Safety Connect and an 11-speaker JBL premium sound  system.\nThe Limited also offers a Toyota Safety Sense package, which  includes adaptive cruise control, a lane departure warning system, lane-keeping  assist, frontal collision warning, automatic pre-collision braking and automatic  high-beam headlight control.",

    "full_description": "The  2023 Toyota Tundra full-size pickup is coming off a full redesign just last  year. It has significantly more power, capabilities and comfort than the  generation before it, but that shouldn't be too surprising since that  predecessor had been kicking around since 2007. One of the most significant  improvements is the new turbocharged  V6 engine that has about as much power as the old Tundra's V8 but generates  more torque, which is helpful for towing, and boasts considerably better  EPA-estimated fuel economy. There's also an optional hybrid V6  powertrain that gives the  Tundra even more muscle over the standard V6. For  2023, the Tundra's changes are predictably light. So far, it's limited to a new  SX package for the SR5 trim. The SX package gives the Tundra a stealthy look,  with dark gray wheels and body-colored door handles and rear bumper. Given  that, we think the Tundra is an agreeable choice for a light-duty pickup. But  the rival Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 have some advantages that could make them a  better buy. Check out our test team's Expert Rating below for a complete  rundown of the latest Tundra's hits and misses. We  suggest the midrange Limited trim  out of the Tundra's lineup. You not only get a larger infotainment touchscreen  and a smoother ride from hydraulic cab mounts, but it's also the least  expensive way to get the optional hybrid powertrain. How does the Tundra drive? While the loss of the snarling 5.7-liter V8 might cause some concern among the Tundra faithful, the turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 is more than a suitable replacement. There's a substantial amount of torque on tap, even at low rpm, and the 10-speed automatic transmission shifts quickly and smoothly. In our testing, a 4WD Tundra accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 6.6 seconds, which is respectably quick. That power makes it easy to merge with traffic and pass on the open highway without a second thought.    Braking is similarly solid. Our panic-braking test from 60 mph saw the Tundra stop in 131 feet \u2014 that's a bit better than average \u2014 and that was with the TRD Off-Road package's more rugged tires that our test truck had. The light and accurate steering makes it easy to guide the truck down tight backcountry roads and can occasionally feel like the smaller Tacoma.    That TRD Off-Road package that our test truck had includes a locking rear differential and additional off-road driving modes, but it didn't seem to appreciably improve the truck's off-roading capability. This is a big truck and its long wheelbase means the underbody can easily hang up on seemingly easy obstacles. If you're going to hit up any trails in the Tundra, you'll probably want to get the TRD Pro. How comfortable is the Tundra? This Tundra is a marked improvement over the previous generation. Seat comfort and interior noise levels are vastly improved, and the Tundra is a pleasant truck for covering long distances for both front and rear passengers. Though the V6 engine is less sonorous than the previously available V8, under full throttle the V6 sounds appropriately burly for a full-size truck.     The Ram 1500 still rules the class in outright ride quality, but the Tundra offers a fairly buttoned-down and jitter-free ride over most surfaces. The Tundra's straightforward climate control system is largely set it and forget it, but we appreciate the large buttons and dials even if some of the labeling can be tough to decipher in bright sunlight. How\u2019s the interior? While the optional 14-inch touchscreen certainly gets your attention, the Tundra's straightforward interior layout and overall ease of use leave a more lasting impression. Gauges and graphics are easy to read at a glance, and the commanding driving position makes piloting the full-size Tundra much less daunting. Like all full-size trucks, the Tundra offers ample room for all passengers, especially in the CrewMax configuration.     When equipped with the optional panoramic sunroof and unique full-width power rear window, the Tundra feels downright airy and spacious. Even with the Tundra's sizable hood, forward visibility is generally good. But the truck's chunky windshield pillars can easily block your view on two-lane roads. We recommend getting the Tundra's surround-view camera system since it makes maneuvering the truck in tight spots a lot easier. How\u2019s the tech? The Tundra's optional 14-inch touchscreen is a standout feature. It has crisp-looking graphics, and its various onscreen menus are easy to use. In fact, we'd wager some smartphone users might even prefer the native setup to Apple CarPlay or Android Auto (which come standard) for most features. Our test truck had the upgraded JBL audio system, but we found the sound quality from the standard system to be more than adequate.    The Tundra's advanced driver aids, most of which come standard, generally work well. We didn't experience any false alarms in our testing. The only letdown was the lane keeping system, which wasn't particularly useful in keeping this big truck centered between lane markers. How are the towing and storage? The latest Tundra has stout capabilities. Our test truck, with its standard V6 engine and 4WD CrewMax configuration, was rated to tow 11,120 pounds when properly equipped. The Tundra's maximum towing and hauling capacities aren't class-leading, but they're certainly good enough for what most owners will be doing with their trucks. A reinforced composite bed is standard.    The extra space of the CrewMax four-door allows for plenty of storage options in the rear interior for items you'd rather not place in the bed. Rear underseat storage is generous as is small-item storage for front passengers. But the interior storage isn't as well organized in the Tundra as in its domestic counterparts, and we could see the Tundra's various bins becoming a bit messy in a hurry. How\u2019s the fuel economy? Fuel economy isn't usually top of mind for most buyers of full-size trucks, but those interested in the Tundra might want to lower their expectations. The EPA estimates 19 mpg combined for the 4WD Tundra, which is comparable to competitors. However, our test truck clocked a disappointing 15.2 mpg on our real-world evaluation route. And the Tundra managed to achieve only 16.9 mpg during a weekend fishing trip of mostly open-highway driving. That's worse than what we've observed from our testing of other full-size trucks. Is the Tundra a good value? The interior is built to a very high standard. Gaps are tight, and all the various trim elements lined up precisely. Though our Limited trim test Tundra lacked luxury touches such as wood and chrome you find in other midlevel full-size trucks, the Toyota did not feel the least bit downmarket or utilitarian.     Warranties are about average for the class, with three years/36,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage and five years/60,000 miles for the powertrain. But the Tundra's two years/25,000 miles of free maintenance is a slight step above. The Tundra can't claim to be best-in-class when it comes to towing, hauling or ride comfort, but there's nothing wrong with having competence and comfort as primary strengths. This truck is easy to drive and easy to live with, and its available 14-inch touchscreen and full-width power rear window help give it a distinctive driving experience.",

    "full_description": "For  its fifth generation, the Toyota Prius has gone through a truly remarkable  transformation. Eco geek is out; eco chic is in. The 2023 Prius gets a complete  redesign with a sleek new shape and an overhauled interior. There's also a more  robust hybrid powertrain that offers considerable gains in performance yet  still gets similar fuel economy to previous models. \nA  universal gripe about older Prius models has been their lackluster acceleration.  Last year's fourth-generation Prius, for example, produced a meager 121 system  horsepower between the engine and motor. The new Prius produces up to 196 hp  and can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in around 7 seconds. That's considerably  quicker than the 10.7 seconds needed by the last Prius we tested and should  make accelerating quickly on highway entrances a considerably easier task.\nCrucially,  the new Prius maintains its fuel frugality with a manufacturer-estimated 49-57  mpg in combined city/highway driving, depending on the model. And if that's not  enough, the plug-in hybrid Prius Prime is also new, with more electric range  than before.\nWhile  the Prius' new exterior design gets a lot of attention, the best part of the  transformation is inside the cabin where there is a new tech suite and more  modern aesthetic. Standard is an 8-inch touchscreen, while top trims get the  larger 12.3-inch display. Along with the new infotainment is a host of  available convenience features such as heated and ventilated front seats,  ambient lighting and a panoramic glass roof. The Prius is also still a  hatchback and has a respectably roomy cargo area.\nOverall,  we highly recommend the Prius to anyone shopping for a fuel-efficient car,  especially because two of its core competitors, the Honda Honda Insight and  Hyundai Ioniq, have been discontinued. Presently, it's the Kia Niro that best  rivals the Prius, as it's also available in hybrid and plug-in hybrid form.  We  recommend the midgrade XLE trim for  the best value. It has some desirable extras over the base LE trim, including  keyless entry, heated front seats and synthetic leather upholstery. You might  also consider getting an XLE with the optional 12.3-inch center touchscreen,  though it's not a must-have. How does the Prius drive? The new Prius' big boost in power isn't really noticeable in everyday city driving; the car is smooth and able to smartly accelerate from a stoplight, just like older models. But the extra horsepower is a boon for merging onto a highway or climbing a long grade, which are now a lot less stressful to do. At Edmunds' test track, our test front-wheel-drive Prius accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds, a big gain over the prior generation's 10.7-second sprint.\n\n   Structural updates and new suspension components in several areas have also improved the Prius composure on the road. The steering is numb, but it feels precise and tracks straight with no effort. How comfortable is the Prius? The Prius' front seats offer enough support to be comfortable for longer stints. The rear seats are also comfortable, though they don't recline. We like how the Prius rides smoothly over bumps and broken pavement. However, excessive tire, wind and engine noise under acceleration holds the Prius back from being a fully relaxing car to drive. \n\n   There's only a single climate zone, and the latest Prius has lost some of its finer climate controls that previous models had, such as the ability to shut off the fans to all seats but the driver to enhance efficiency. Every Prius trim except the base LE has heated front seats, and the top Limited trim comes with ventilated front seats and optional heated rear seats. How\u2019s the interior? A conventional dashboard layout and well-placed controls make the Prius interior functional and easy to interact with. Less appealing is the digital instrument cluster. It displays too much information and looks cluttered as a result. Its placement and shape are also awkward; most of our drivers found that when they adjusted the seat and steering wheel to their desired position, the top of the steering wheel partially blocked their view of the display. \n\n   The Prius' latest design has also cut down on backseat room and visibility compared to older models. The rear door openings have shrunk, and you have to duck down quite a bit to get into the back. Once you do get inside, headroom is in short supply for anyone near 6 feet tall. That means you have to slouch down to avoid hitting your head on the ceiling each time the car goes over a bump. Rear visibility is poor because of the angled rear window and thick rear roof pillars. The Prius styling changes give it more visual appeal, but it has come at the cost of some practicality. How\u2019s the tech? Our Prius Limited test vehicle had the upsized 12.3-inch center touchscreen. We like the clean interface, responsiveness and Google-powered navigation of Toyota's latest multimedia system. Wireless connectivity for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay comes standard, along with a wireless charging pad on higher trims. But be careful: It's not cooled, so after about an hour in there your phone will come out feeling toasty. If you prefer to charge more conventionally, there are six USB-C ports spread throughout the cabin.\n\n   The Prius' driver aids are also a highlight. The lane keeping assistance system keeps the hybrid centered in its lane effectively, and acceleration and braking are smooth when using adaptive cruise control. Another feature, Proactive Driving Assist, provides subtle hints to the driver in everyday situations. For example, if traffic slows ahead of you, the Prius will start to brake very subtly as you lift off the gas as a hint to start slowing down. It also flashes an LED strip on the dash if traffic in front of you pulls away. It would be easy for a system like this to be annoying enough to shut it off, but it never came across as overbearing during our testing. How\u2019s the storage? Open up the Prius' hatchback and you'll have 20.3 cubic feet of cargo space available behind the rear seats. This is more cargo space than you'll get from a similarly sized sedan's trunk, but it's less than previous Prius models offered. It's now shallower and skinnier than before, and we couldn't fit a set of golf clubs lengthwise across the back of the Prius. The raised cargo floor might suggest some sort of underfloor storage, but there's none to be found.\n\n   Up front, the Prius has a skinny-but-deep center console bin and a helpful rubberized space under the dash to store small items. The available wireless charging pad is conveniently located next to the gear shifter. The cupholders are a touch larger than usual and will fit most water bottles. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Prius' calling card is its efficiency, and this latest model still delivers. The EPA estimates you'll get 57 mpg in combined city/highway driving for the LE trim\u00a0 or 52 mpg combined for XLE and Limited trims (front-wheel-drive models). AWD models knock 3 mpg off of each of those figures. On our real-world testing route, we observed 52.3 mpg, hitting the EPA estimated 52 mpg combined number for the Limited FWD Prius nearly on the nose. There's a reason the Prius name and fuel efficiency go hand in hand. Is the Prius a good value? Toyota offers a three-year/36,000-mile standard warranty and a five-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty. But on hybrids like the Prius, the hybrid components are covered for eight years/100,000 miles and the battery itself up to 10 years/150,000 miles. Toyota also provides two years of free maintenance, something not often found outside the luxury sphere.\u00a0 \n\n   The Prius is an economical car, but the pricing on its higher trims has gotten to where it's no longer a frugal option. Opting for all-wheel drive pushes the price tag up even higher. At these elevated prices, some hybrid SUVs and midsize sedans come into play if you find yourself needing or wanting more room for passengers or cargo.\n\n   The Prius' interior quality has taken a step forward on this latest model, but there are still some obvious hard plastic panels. The doors feel a bit flimsy and make a tinny sound when you close them. The Prius dramatic makeover pulls it from the ranks of \"ugliest car\" lists to something sleek and cohesive. It's also very impressive that the new Prius has retained the same level of efficiency with such a big increase in power. The hybrid is now one of the quicker (though still not very exciting) compact cars around and you can get over 50 mpg in most cases. Fuel economy remains the Prius main attraction, but the rest of the car has gotten more attractive in the bargain as well.",

    "full_description": "The  Toyota GR86 is one of the most entertaining and engaging sports cars you can  buy, a rare island of affordable fun surrounded by a vast ocean of SUVs and  trucks. Its front engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and light curb weight offer  good balance and thrilling driving dynamics. Sports cars like the GR86 aren't  known for brutal straight-line acceleration, though. Instead, they excel at  shredding curvy back roads. And the GR86 is perfect for drivers who want an  enjoyable and inexpensive sport coupe and don't mind its small dimensions.\u00a0  \nToyota  redesigned the GR86 for the 2022 model year, adding a more powerful engine and  updated tech in addition to new styling. For 2023, Toyota adds a Special  Edition model that's limited to 860 units. The new GR86 Special Edition sports  an exclusive orange Solar Shift paint color, a GR performance exhaust with  black chrome tips, and black graphics on the rear roof pillar. The Special  Edition model also gets distinct 18-inch black wheels with performance tires  and an interior Special Edition badge. Since it's based on the Premium trim, it  also packs all the niceties found in the range-topping model. \nAs  with its predecessors, the Scion FR-S and Toyota 86, the GR86 is a sibling to  the Subaru BRZ, which we named the Edmunds Top Rated Sports Car for 2022. It also competes with a  longtime favorite among enthusiasts, the Mazda MX-5 Miata. And then there's an  American rival, the ever-popular Ford Mustang. And fun front-wheel-drive cars  like the Volkswagen Golf GTI are worthy alternatives. We like the Toyota GR86  and think it's a compelling sports car, but there are some drawbacks to  consider, such as its tiny rear seats. Check out the Edmunds Expert Rating  below to get our test team's full review of the GR86's performance, fuel  economy and more.  We  suggest going with the Premium trim  level. The upgrade gives you larger wheels with performance summer tires, a  duckbill-style rear spoiler, adaptive LED headlights, and heated front seats  with simulated suede and leather upholstery. How does the GR86 drive? The best part of the GR86 is its sublime handling. The steering feel is excellent, and when the GR86 is equipped with the optional high-performance summer tires, grip and confidence are equally impressive. Balance is exceptional as well, but the GR86's somewhat stiffly tuned suspension makes it a bit of a handful on bumpy roads. As for stopping power, our test GR86 stopped from 60 mph in just 104 feet, which is a respectably short distance for a low-priced performance car.\n\n   Acceleration is improved with this latest-generation 86. The 2.4-liter engine gets it from 0 to 60 mph in 6 seconds flat with the manual transmission, which is half a second quicker than the previous-generation car. The shifter feels positive and precise in your hand as you move through the gates, and the pedals are well placed for heel-and-toe downshift rev-matching. The clutch pedal is light and has an easy-to-find catch point. Opting for the automatic transmission results in slower acceleration (6.9 seconds), but it's easier to live with in heavy traffic. It also comes with paddle shifters and provides quick downshifts when you select Track mode. How comfortable is the GR86? Toyota has given the GR86 slightly stiffer suspension tuning than the related Subaru BRZ. Of the two setups, we prefer the BRZ's. The 86 might feel more exciting at lower speeds, but the constant motion and jittering can start to wear on the driver after an hour or so. \n\n   The manually adjustable seats feature improved bolstering for your upper back and manage to hold you in place without being restrictive. Dual-zone climate control for such a small car seems like overkill, but it does the job and keeps both front passengers happy and comfortable.\n\n   Unfortunately, the 86 is a bit on the noisy side. Road and tire noise is near constant and very loud. And engine noise is more annoying than evocative. How\u2019s the interior? The interior of the GR86 lets you focus on what matters most: driving. The low, unobtrusive dashboard aids in forward visibility, and the digital instrument panel can be read with a quick glance. Special mention should go to the GR86's small steering wheel, which allows taller drivers to enter and exit the little coupe without issue. Just remember that the GR86's lower ride height and longer doors can make getting in and out a bit more difficult than more practical performance cars such as the Volkswagen GTI.\n\n   The GR86's compact dimensions don't give it an abundance of interior room, but front passengers will find it more than comfortable, especially if they're on the taller side. Taller drivers will also appreciate the added space and room for adjustment, especially when compared to the much more cramped Miata. The rear seats, however, are better used as interior storage space than for passengers. How\u2019s the tech? The GR86 comes with a decent number of technology features. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone compatibility is standard, but there's no native navigation system. There are two quick-charging USB ports in the center armrest, allowing you to tuck your smartphone out of the way while driving. The center touchscreen's graphics aren't going to win any awards, but the system is easy to understand and responds relatively quickly to touch commands. \n\n   Far less impressive is the audio system. While that's likely not a priority for a sports car, the system can't really keep up with interior noise levels and is easily taxed by moderate volume. We think there's room for improvement here. \n\n   The GR86 is available with a decent number of advanced driver aids. But most of them require getting the optional automatic transmission. The GR86's traction and stability systems are well calibrated for daily driving. You can also engage the Track mode, which loosens the systems so you can have more dynamic control of the car. Or you can turn them off completely. How\u2019s the storage? You might not think practicality was a consideration with the GR86, but it is surprisingly useful for weekly errands. Its relatively small 6.3 cubic feet of trunk space is hampered by its short height. But when the seats are folded, Toyota says the GR86 can hold a set of its own replacement wheels and tires. For reference, the Miata's trunk can swallow 4.3 cubes, while the substantially larger Mustang holds 13.5 cubes.\n\n   Inside, the GR86 offers a small but practical amount of storage. The cupholders reside well behind the driver's right arm, so you're never at risk of bumping them while driving, and the rear seats excel at holding bags, jackets and other items you don't want rolling around in the trunk. The rear seats do have child safety seat anchor points, but getting any reasonably sized safety seat in and out of the car is a major challenge. How\u2019s the fuel economy? Thanks to its light weight and relatively small engine, the GR86 is capable of decent fuel economy for a sports car. The EPA estimates the car gets 25 mpg combined (21 city/31 highway) with its automatic transmission. We were pleasantly surprised to see 28 mpg on our 115-mile real-world evaluation route. If you select the manual transmission, the EPA's estimate drops to 22 mpg combined (20 city/27 highway); we got 23 mpg on the same route with our manual-equipped test car. Either way, it's fair to assume the EPA's numbers are realistic. Is the GR86 a good value? The GR86 is a bargain. Even when fully equipped with an automatic transmission and its suite of advanced driver aids, the GR86 comes in at under $35,000 when new. While we wouldn't go so far as to call the interior premium, it is well put together and the car feels good and solid. To get a similar amount of equipment and optional extras, most competitors would cost thousands more.\n\n   Warranties for the GR86 are fairly standard, with three years/36,000 miles and five years/50,000 miles offered for bumper-to-bumper and powertrain warranties. Toyota also includes three years/36,000 miles for roadside assistance and two years for free maintenance. With the reintroduction of the Supra and now the reinvigorated GR86, it's clear that Toyota is once again in the sports car business. While it might be easy to focus on the partnerships Toyota has struck to make these cars happen, having more sports cars on the market is what should matter. The GR86 strikes a great balance between cost and performance and opens up fun-to-drive rear-wheel-drive dynamics to a much wider audience. But don't let the lower price dissuade you from thinking the GR86 is a serious performance car. Even experienced drivers will enjoy getting the most out of this little sports car every day.",

    "full_description": "If  you need a midsize hybrid sedan that's slightly bigger and more luxurious than  the Camry Hybrid, Toyota offers the Avalon Hybrid. It's not that much bigger  than a Camry, but the Avalon offers a more comfortable ride, more luxury  features, and sleek styling that helps it stand out from its more pedestrian  sedan sibling.  \nThe  2022 Toyota Avalon Hybrid is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and  electric motor combo that's good for a combined 215 horsepower.

It's also got a near-luxury interior that  comes standard with a 9-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto,  heated front seats and four USB ports. It's a comfortable place to be, though  rear passengers must trade some headroom for the car's raked roofline.\nFor  2022, the Avalon's midlevel XSE trim becomes the XSE Nightshade Edition and  gains dark exterior accents and larger 19-inch alloy wheels. The standard Toyota  Safety System suite of features is also expanded to include lane centering and  traffic sign recognition, and the rear seat reminder feature is now standard on  all models. The Avalon Hybrid competes against other hybrid midsize sedans,  including the Honda Accord Hybrid and its own downmarket stablemate, the Camry  Hybrid. Check out our Expert Rating below to see how it stacks up. The  Toyota Avalon has historically served as a stepping stone to the more premium  offerings from Lexus. But the Avalon can be luxurious in its own right when  ordered in the range-topping Limited trim.  That model gets you genuine leather upholstery, wood interior trim and a  14-speaker audio system from JBL. How does the Avalon Hybrid drive? The Avalon Hybrid makes the most of its available power. The continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) is responsive when you step on the gas pedal, even when you select the Eco drive mode. We recorded a 0-60 mph time of 8.2 seconds in our testing. That's slower than a typical V6-powered large sedan, but we think most buyers will find this acceptable for the considerable gains in fuel economy.\n\n   The braking feels natural in most situations thanks to an imperceptible transition from regenerative to regular brakes. We measured a panic-stop performance from 60 mph of 126 feet, which is around the class average, though the sounds our test car made in the process were a bit more alarming than usual. Despite its luxury cruiser attitude, the Avalon Hybrid is surprisingly fun to drive around tight corners and maintains its composure surprisingly well. How comfortable is the Avalon Hybrid? All-around comfort is the primary reason you'd consider a sedan like this, and the Avalon Hybrid delivers. The ride is cushy without feeling buoyant like some rivals. The seats are welcoming too, with soft leather and compliant cushions. Our Limited trim test vehicle had heated and ventilated seats and a heated steering wheel, all of which worked well. The rear outboard seats are also heated in the Limited.\n\n   Like most hybrids, the Avalon isn't immune to the shudder that passes through the cabin as the gasoline engine fires up. The hybrid system can also produce some low-volume but high-pitched whirring noises while the car is stopped. How\u2019s the interior? The Avalon's interior is a pleasant place to spend time in, though there are some faults. Some controls and buttons are out of reach or hard to find, especially the ones near your left knee. The Avalon also sits rather low, which may present a problem for passengers who are less limber. We're also not enamored with its size. Despite being more expensive, the Avalon isn't much larger than a Toyota Camry, and there's less rear headroom due to the Avalon's raked roof.\n\n   Otherwise, the Avalon's cabin is quite nice. Most drivers will find an agreeable position since the steering wheel and driver's seat both offer a useful range of travel. Rear visibility is good overall, though the rear shelf is high. How\u2019s the tech? The Avalon infotainment system features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. There are plenty of USB ports plus an optional wireless charging pad. Passengers jockeying for a free port is effectively a thing of the past.\n\n   The touchscreen has a bright, attractive display and an easy-to-use integrated navigation system. As with most systems, you cannot enter a new address while moving. For that, you have to use the voice command system, which is frequently confused and has limited point-of-interest search.\n\n   Most of the Avalon's driving aids are standard and work well, though adaptive cruise control has a tendency to leave a large gap between you and the car in front. How\u2019s the storage? Most big sedans have a cavernous trunk, and the Avalon Hybrid is no exception. In fact, the trunk is the same size as the regular Avalon's \u2014 16 cubic feet. The rear seats can fold down to increase cargo space.\n\n   Interior storage is similarly generous, at least for those in front. The center armrest is as roomy as one you'd find in an SUV, and there's a nicely sized bin in front of the shifter, which also houses the wireless charging pad. The door pockets aren't large, which limits storage in the back, but overall it's quite good.\n\n   The car seat anchors and generous interior space make loading a child seat a breeze. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Avalon Hybrid Limited is rated at 43 mpg combined (43 city/44 highway). It's a little thirstier than midsize sedans such as the Honda Accord Hybrid (48 mpg combined) and the Camry Hybrid (up to 52 mpg combined), but it's far more efficient than the standard Avalon V6 (25 mpg). Is the Avalon Hybrid a good value? Though the Avalon Hybrid has some hard touch points, its interior materials are a clear step above those in the Camry. There are even a few surprises in the form of premium-looking quilted stitching on the seats and doors.\n\n   The Avalon Hybrid is only marginally more expensive than an identically equipped Avalon, though a similarly equipped Lexus ES 300h doesn't cost too much more. The basic and powertrain coverage is average for the class. Toyota also offers free scheduled maintenance for your first two visits. You'll be impressed by how enjoyable the Avalon Hybrid is to drive. Handling is composed, even though grip is ultimately low, and body roll is well controlled. The only real downside is the powertrain's slowish acceleration.\n\n   Is there personality here? No, not really. Other than the oversized front grille, the Avalon is conservatively styled and accomplishes exactly what you'd expect.",

    "full_description": "The  2022 Toyota Avalon is one of the only vehicles left in the large sedan class.  The Chevy Impala and Ford Taurus are long gone, so the segment now consists of  just three vehicles: the Avalon and the Dodge Charger/Chrysler 300 twins. For  our money, the Avalon is the best of the bunch. It offers a smooth ride,  comfortable seats and a richly appointed interior. Unfortunately, Toyota has  confirmed that 2022 is the Avalon's last year of production. Toyota has also  made changes to available equipment by eliminating the optional all-wheel-drive  system and discontinuing the TRD trim level.  \nThe  Avalon is now in this generation's fourth model year, and we don't have many  complaints about this well-rounded big sedan. If you're in the market for a  large sedan, the Toyota Avalon is highly recommended. For full details on how  the Avalon scores in categories from fuel economy to performance, check out the  Edmunds' Expert Rating below.  We  recommend the midlevel Avalon Touring.  Along with the sport-tuned adaptive suspension, the Touring trim level comes  with some features you'll likely want on an Avalon such as ventilated front  seats, a 14-speaker audio system and integrated navigation. The Touring also  gives you access to the optional Advanced safety package, which includes  parking sensors and a 360-degree parking camera. How does the Avalon drive? With a potent 301-horsepower V6 mated to a smooth-shifting transmission, the Avalon has good power to get up and go. It is also pleasant to use in most scenarios, from long road trips and afternoon cruises to day-to-day commutes and short errands around town. Braking is consistent and never grabby, which lends to its comfort in daily use. \n\n   The Avalon is surprising in its athleticism \u2014 with shockingly enjoyable handling and drivability. While not a sport sedan, this cruiser can handle twisty roads with relative ease for a vehicle of its size. Think about a mobile defensive end or tackle in football as opposed to an athletic linebacker. How comfortable is the Avalon? Comfort is a strength for the Avalon and is probably the primary reason you'd consider such a large sedan. All seating positions give you ample cushioning and support for long drives or short cruises. The leather upholstery is very soft and gives the sensation that the Avalon is more upscale than its price suggests. \n\n   The ride is cushioned and makes you feel shielded from harsh roads. The cabin is also really cozy due to the climate control's quick heating and cooling. While there is no rattling or shaking inside the cabin, road noise is somewhat present at all times. How\u2019s the interior? The Avalon's cabin is a decent place to be. It is roomy and user-friendly. There are even redundant key functions located on the steering wheel. Legroom is abundant, the driving position is superb due to its multitude and depth of adjustments, and visibility is great up front and modest to the sides and over the shoulder. \n\n   As far as controls go, there are two minor issues: The radio tuning knob can be a reach for some, and a couple of functions, such as turning on the camera view, are tucked away. While legroom is a strength, headroom can feel a little compromised for taller people \u2014 especially in the rear due to the sloping roofline. Lastly, the low-resolution rearview camera and display could use an upgrade. How\u2019s the tech? Toyota's Entune system and its 9-inch touchscreen are surprisingly good. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration systems are supported. The display is bright and responds well to inputs, but Toyota tends to lock out more functions while you're driving than other carmakers. \n\n   There are two USB ports up front and two in back. The front console also houses a wireless charging pad. The car's built-in voice controls are hit-or-miss \u2014 it's better at understanding radio commands than navigation commands. We had much more success using Siri via Apple CarPlay. How\u2019s the storage? While cargo capacity is average on paper, the Avalon works out to be more convenient compared to some others due to the wide trunk opening, broad floor and convenient loading height. You might be disappointed if you're the type who folds the rear seats to expand the space because there's a sizable step up to the folded seats.\n\n   Inside, there are numerous small cubbies, plenty of cupholders, and a center console that's sizable and surprisingly deep. The door pockets are average, but there are enough other options that it's not a concern. The Avalon really shines when it comes to fitting child safety seats. The car seat anchors are easy to access, and the huge rear bench has space enough for just about any type of seat. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Avalon is rated at 25 combined mpg (22 city/31 highway), which is excellent for this class of car. It's not outstanding like the hybrid variant, but it's still really good. During our mixed-driving 115-mile evaluation route, we were able to observe 26 mpg, which slightly beat the combined EPA score. Is the Avalon a good value? The Avalon offers a good deal of quality and refinement. It feels close enough to the Lexus ES in this regard that someone looking for a large sedan might want to consider the Avalon because it costs thousands less. Beyond the great deal, you also get high gas mileage, a good roadside assistance program, and free scheduled maintenance for the first two years. The Avalon is a low-key performer. The exterior, aside from the huge brace-face grille, is nondescript, while the interior delivers a composed, civil and sophisticated style. None of this is bad, but it sets you up to be surprised by its hidden athleticism. In the context of a big family sedan, it's fun to drive due to its surprising handling capabilities and strong V6 engine.",

    "full_description": "When  the Toyota Venza re-emerged after six years off the market, it found itself in  the highly competitive midsize SUV segment. Though it's not in the running for  best in class, the Venza distinguishes itself from its competitors with an  emphasis on style and fuel economy.  Built  on the same platform as the popular RAV4, the Venza is more than 5 inches  longer and features a sleek profile thanks to a sloping roofline and sharp rear  end design. The Venza is also offered as a hybrid only, packing the same  219-horsepower gas-electric setup as the RAV4 Hybrid. Inside, the Venza offers  a stylish, tech-rich cabin that looks and feels luxurious.For  2023, Toyota is adding a new Nightshade Edition based on the XLE model but with  blacked-out accents and additional equipment. All Venzas receive Toyota's  latest infotainment software, and the upgraded 12.3-inch touchscreen previously  only available on the Limited is now standard on the XLE as well. The  Venza competes with other midsize offerings like the Honda Passport, Subaru  Outback and Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport, but unfortunately, it can't hang with  its rivals when it comes to cargo space. Still, if you want an SUV that gets  great mileage and looks good doing it, the Venza might be for you. Check out  our test team's exhaustive Expert Rating below to learn all about the 2023  Toyota Venza.Please note that the following  rating was conducted on a pre-2023 Venza. We'll update the score once we test  the RAV4's latest touchscreen. We recommend the base LE trim for its low starting price and  impressive complement of advanced driver assist features. How does the Venza drive? The specs for the Venza's four-cylinder hybrid powertrain don't look like much on paper, but this SUV is adequately quick in real-world acceleration. In Edmunds' testing it covered 0-60 mph in 7.6 seconds. That's a second behind the Honda Passport but quicker than a V6 Jeep Grand Cherokee.    The Venza's handling doesn't quite match its sporty looks, but it is tidy and confident as you go around turns. When you're just commuting around town, Toyota's mastery of blending gas and electric power shows through and the Venza delivers smooth and virtually lag-free acceleration. How comfortable is the Venza? Toyota paid special attention to dialing up the comfort level in the Venza. The cabin is well insulated from the sounds of the outside environment, and the engine doesn't have the annoying drone that it does in the RAV4 Hybrid. The Venza also delivers excellent ride comfort, feeling more like a Lexus in the way it dispatches bumps and handles highway dips.    The front seats are both comfortable and supportive. Our Limited trim test vehicle featured front seats with heat and ventilation, but we didn't find the seat ventilation to be all that effective. Thankfully, the dual-zone climate control provides more than adequate cooling. Rear passengers have pretty comfortable seats as well, with reclining seatbacks and climate control vents to ensure good air flow. How\u2019s the interior? We consider the Venza a rival to other midsize SUVs such as the Honda Passport and Subaru Outback. However, it has less interior space than those vehicles and generally matches the RAV4, which is a class size smaller. This isn't to say it's cramped inside; it's just that it's not as roomy as other SUVs in the same price range.    The rest of the interior is quite good. Toyota's latest (optional) 12.3-inch infotainment screen offers a user-friendly interface and menu structure. Below this screen are upgraded touch-sensitive controls for the climate control and radio. They work OK and are responsive, but we'd still prefer standard push-buttons and knobs.    The Venza's sleek body is relatively easy to climb in and out of and offers excellent forward visibility. The thick rear roof pillars obscure some of the natural view over your shoulder, but blind-spot monitoring is standard to help you out while changing lanes. Our Limited trim came with a 360-degree parking camera system that takes much of the guesswork out of maneuvering in tight spaces. How\u2019s the tech? Toyota has finally caught up with the industry on smartphone integration, offering Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard features in the Venza. The projection of your phone's apps doesn't use up all of the space on the optional 12.3-inch touchscreen, but it spans a good amount and leaves room for additional on-screen controls. The native navigation system isn't as elegant, quick or easy as phone-based navigation apps, but it's nice to have in case you don't have a cell signal. Four USB ports plus a wireless charger provide power on the go for all devices on board.    Toyota has also come a long way with its advanced driver aids, and many come as standard equipment. Adaptive cruise control works down to a full stop, and lane centering assist keeps you in bounds without ping-ponging off lane markers. It's one of the more comprehensive and well-executed systems in the segment.    And we'd be remiss if we didn't mention the Venza's optional tint-on-demand electrochromic panoramic sunroof. With the push of a button, you can switch from clear glass to opaque white. It effectively blocks out much of the direct sun and heat but maintains a bright cabin space. How\u2019s the storage? Size matters when it comes to storage, and the Venza is smaller than most in the class. The cargo area is usable and doesn't look that small in isolation, but at 28.8 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats, it trails the class by a good margin (even the RAV4 offers more space) and has a slightly awkward liftover height. The 60/40-split seats fold flat, and you can store the cargo cover under the load floor when it's not in use. A hands-free tailgate is standard, something some competitors only offer on top-trim models.    Cabin storage for small items is also limited. Most bins are smaller than those you'll find in the average midsize crossover, and the Venza even lacks overhead space for sunglasses. For those with child seat needs, things are considerably better. Anchors are easy to access and we didn't have any issues installing a large rear-facing infant seat. But drivers over 6 feet will likely need to locate the seat on the passenger side.     It should also be noted that the Venza has not been rated for towing. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates the Venza gets 39 mpg combined. However, we observed an impressive 44.3 mpg over our 115-mile real-world evaluation route. Granted, the Venza only comes as a hybrid, but it obliterates everything in the segment in efficiency. The next most efficient SUV is the Subaru Outback (which is considerably slower) at 29 mpg combined. If our result is an accurate representation, we expect the Venza to routinely match or exceed its EPA estimate. Is the Venza a good value? While the Venza's cost of entry is higher than most in this segment, it has the interior quality and exterior styling of a Lexus. You won't be able to get into a Venza for less than $33,000, but it does come with a significant number of standard features such as a full suite of advanced driving aids, LED headlights and taillights, and a hands-free liftgate. The fully loaded Limited trim is competitively priced with segment leaders too.    Additional benefits for the Venza beyond Toyota's basic three-year/36,000-mile warranty include hybrid powertrain coverage for eight years/100,000 miles. Toyota also recently extended its battery warranty coverage to 10 years/150,000 miles. Free scheduled maintenance is included for the first two years/25,000 miles, and there's roadside assistance for the first two years of ownership. The Venza has returned with a healthy amount of personality. It's destined to be more popular than its predecessor just based on its aggressive new design alone. But that sportier look isn't backed up by athletic performance. Sure, it's adequately quick and very fuel-efficient, but it's not the weekend-joyride type unless the point is seeing how far you can get on a tank of gas.    But if, like us, you value substance, then the Venza excels in almost all the important areas for this midsize SUV class and rewards you with a well-rounded driving experience.",

    "full_description": "The  Toyota 4Runner is a rugged, old-school body-on-frame midsize SUV that's found  success in a world filled with stylish car-based SUVs filled to the brim with  tech. It's not fuel-efficient, comfortable or high-tech, but it's loved for its  tough looks, off-road heritage and versatility. Like many truck-based SUVs, the  4Runner is very capable off-road, has plenty of towing capacity and offers  loads of cargo space. Some rivals try to mimic the 4Runner's rugged look with  body cladding and all-terrain tires, but few are truly built for off-roading.  The 2023 model year marks the 40th  birthday for the 4Runner. To celebrate, Toyota introduces the 40th Anniversary  Special Edition based on the popular (and budget-friendly) SR5 model. Featuring  unique bronze wheels and badging, this 4Runner wows with a heritage-inspired  graphics package. The red, orange and yellow racing stripes pay homage to the  old Toyota pickups that the original 4Runner was based on.If  you aren't into the 4Runner's classic looks or don't need its impressive  off-road capability, there are a few alternatives to consider that perform  better in city driving and offer more modernity. The newly redesigned Jeep  Grand Cherokee and Ford Bronco boast solid off-road chops while offering lots  of comfort and tech. There is also the Honda Passport, which has sufficient  off-road capability for most and packs many modern features. If you'd like to  know more about how the 4Runner performed during testing, check out our Expert  Rating below to get our test team's full review of its performance, fuel  efficiency and more. The  4Runner can be had in many flavors, and all of them are capable of venturing  off the beaten path. But if you want serious off-road hardware to back up this  SUV's rugged looks, get the TRD Off-Road trim. That model gets you off-road-specific drive modes, an off-road cruise  control mode and a locking rear differential. The top-of-the-line TRD Pro is  slightly more capable, but it also costs a good deal more. How does the 4Runner drive? The 4Runner's performance is adequate. It's not terribly fast, but the engine and transmission are smooth. It can hold its own in traffic. The brakes are a bit jumpy, and there's some nosedive when you really mash the brake pedal, but you'll get used to it. Around corners, the 4Runner turns in quickly and provides a pleasing amount of stability for a truck-based SUV. Even so, car-like crossover SUVs are more nimble.    The 4Runner becomes a superstar if you're the sort who would take it off-road for exploring or adventure camping. Its multimode 4WD system, high ground clearance and special TRD features make it capable of taking on rocky trails. If that's important to you, then the 4Runner's otherwise mediocre performance will be more or less insignificant. How comfortable is the 4Runner? You wouldn't be far off the mark if you sized up the 4Runner's comfort potential just by looking at it. You actually can judge this book by its cover. Its truck-based construction results in a somewhat bouncy and stiff ride. It's not terrible, but just about any other crossover SUV rides more smoothly.    The same goes for wind noise as the 4Runner's boxy shape stirs up more than the generally sleeker and more low-slung competition. Interestingly, road noise from the tires is relatively tame because the body-on-frame construction provides an extra layer of sound suppression between road and cabin. How\u2019s the interior? Living with a 4Runner is a pretty pleasant experience, but it has one fairly obvious drawback: its tall ride height. That makes getting in and out somewhat difficult, though side steps are available to help out. It's really no worse than any full-size pickup in this regard, but other crossover SUVs are easier to access.    Once you're inside, you'll find easy-to-understand controls and a highly adjustable driving position that affords a commanding view ahead. There's plenty of space in both the front and back rows. Visibility to the sides and back is surprisingly good because of the 4Runner's squared-off shape and windows. How\u2019s the tech? The 4Runner's touchscreen audio system has clear graphics and numerous fixed shortcut buttons that make it easy to drill down into the menus without staring at the screen as much. It also supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Standard driver aids include traffic-adaptive cruise control and forward collision mitigation. How\u2019s the storage? The 4Runner's squared-off cargo area is big. Fold the rear seats down and you can even roll out sleeping bags back there. Cargo can be accessed by opening the hatch, of course, or by lowering the 4Runner's power rear window.     The roomy second row can accommodate car seats in any of the three positions, even bulkier rear-facing models. The square door openings make for easy access, but little kids will have a hard time climbing up into the cabin. Towing capacity is 5,000 pounds, a useful figure that covers most boats and many small camping trailers. The vehicle is also prewired for not only four-pin but also seven-pin trailer plugs that come on trailers with electric trailer brakes. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The aging 4.0-liter V6 engine and five-speed automatic make for a rather thirsty pairing that does no better than 17 mpg combined (16 city/19 highway). This is, on average, 4 mpg worse than rival crossover SUVs with all-wheel drive. Is the 4Runner a good value? The 4Runner costs more than some of the crossovers it competes with, but in return you get more in terms of off-highway and towing performance. It also has a strong resale value, so much of the extra you'll pay up front will come back when you move on to something else later on.    While you own it, you'll have two years of free scheduled maintenance for things such as oil changes and tire rotations. The warranty, should you ever need it, is fairly standard. The 4Runner's big downside occurs at the pump, which you will be visiting often because its EPA-estimated fuel economy is in the teens in both the city and on the highway. On the road, it's fine. It gets you there. The fun comes in when you take it off-road. As every other SUV has descended into crossover pavement-and-snow mediocrity, the 4Runner still waves the flag for the body-on-frame SUV fans who want real off-road performance.",

    "full_description": "The  Tacoma is one of Toyota's success stories. Not only does it outsell the Tundra  and 4Runner, it's also the best-selling pickup in the midsize truck segment.  Over the years it has built a fiercely loyal following, and the Tacoma can be  uniquely customized thanks to what seems like an infinite number of aftermarket  products. This is a tough truck with impressive off-road capability and is a  manageable size if you don't want a full-size truck.  \nRumors  of a fully redesigned Tacoma for 2023 have proven untrue, so it continues in  much the same form as last year. The only additions include two appearance  packages that dress up the SR5 trim with either black or chrome embellishments.  Other changes amount to increased availability of a few minor features. These  include a larger touchscreen, keyless entry and a power driver's seat.\u00a0 \nUnlike  the Tacoma, the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon trucks will be redesigned for  2023, and the Nissan Frontier was just overhauled for 2022. To stay competitive  there will be a new Tacoma soon, but we'll have to keep waiting. That  said, if you're in the market for a midsize truck and can't wait for the next  one, the current highly rated Tacoma is still a compelling choice. For a  thorough review, check out our test team's evaluation of the Tacoma in the  Edmunds' Expert Rating below.\nWhat's  it like to live with?\nWe bought a 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road and lived with  it in our long-term fleet for nearly two years, racking up more than 40,000  miles on the odometer. The Tacoma has received some updates since its redesign  in 2016, but it's the same generation truck and most of our observations apply.  Find out what we thought of everything from its all-around capability to the  tech in our long-term Tacoma test. We  suggest going with the SR5 trim  level if you don't need the added off-road capability of the TRD trims. The SR5  keeps the price down and gives you the choice of both engine options. It also  comes with an 8-inch touchscreen, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a  power-adjustable driver's seat (V6 versions). You also get the choice of a few  optional tech and driver aid packages. How does the Tacoma drive? The Tacoma steers and handles smoothly and is generally easy to drive. The main exception is the brakes, which feel grabby and can induce nosedive in hard stops. We do wish the 3.5-liter V6 felt a bit more willing, but there is enough power for daily use. The transmission shifts predictably and is able to get the most out of the engine.\n\n   Off-road is where the Tacoma truly shines and stands above all others except the Gladiator. The Tacoma has the clearance, gearing and traction to tackle serious terrain, and the brakes and throttle prove brilliantly precise and controllable in low-range crawling situations. How comfortable is the Tacoma? The Tacoma was never a disagreeable truck to ride in, but changes introduced in 2020 made it a little bit more pleasant. A fully adjustable 10-way driver's seat comes standard in V6 trucks, and this seat promotes long-range comfort for drivers of almost all shapes and sizes. \n\n   The thicker side-window glass cuts down the wind noise compared to prior years, though the Colorado and the Ridgeline still have an edge here. The same is true for ride quality since the Tacoma is still truckier than its smoothest-riding competitors. As for the climate system, it has effective heating and cooling and is easy to adjust. How\u2019s the interior? The Tacoma's main drawback is its tallish step-in height. Get past that and everything else is solid once you're inside. The controls are logical and straightforward, including the large infotainment screen and the recently redesigned knobs and physical shortcut buttons. \n\n   The 10-way power seat provides a greater range of adjustability than in pre-2020 models, but we wish the telescoping steering wheel pulled out more. The front seat roominess benefits from the seat's added downward adjustability, but other dimensions remain the same as before. Visibility is very good thanks to the profile of the hood, ample side windows, and a forward- and side-looking camera system. How\u2019s the tech? The latest Tacoma is pretty well stocked with tech features. Toyota introduced a new screen in 2020 that featured a larger size, crisper map graphics and quicker responses than in previous models. You also get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone compatibility and even Amazon Alexa. Built-in navigation is an inexpensive upgrade option, and it's probably worth getting if you're planning on venturing out of cellphone range a lot. \n\n   Toyota's approach to standard active safety tech is admirable. Adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, automatic high-beam control and even a driver drowsiness warning system are all standard on all grades. How are the towing and storage? The Tacoma's truck bed is ideal. It's made of a composite material that needs no bedliner, and it has an enviable combination of fixed and movable tie-downs. Loading is easy because the tailgate opens low and its bedsides aren't comically tall. The Tacoma does lag behind some others with its 6,800-pound maximum tow rating, but the deficit isn't large. \n\n   Interior storage for small items is adequate. Folding the rear seats down into their cargo-carrying position is a little fussy, but as a result it offers better storage space than all but the Ridgeline and the Gladiator. Installing child safety seats is easy, but larger rear-facing and infant seats might eat into front passenger room. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The 3.5-liter V6 engine and six-speed automatic combo earns 20 mpg combined (18 city/22 highway) in 4WD trim and 21 mpg combined in rear-wheel-drive models. Our testing leads us to believe that these ratings are achievable and accurate. \n\n   We tested a 2016 TRD 4WD Off-Road for more than a year and averaged 18.6 mpg over 40,000 miles of use. We were able to exceed the highway rating on several road trips, and there are good reasons why our truck may have come up just over 1 mpg short. Our home-base location skews the mix toward city driving, and the TRD Off-Road has knobbier tires and lacks the front airdam that comes on most Tacomas. Is the Tacoma a good value? You get a lot of well-built truck and a bed with many standard cargo-handling and safety features for your money. The value equation is particularly good on the TRD models. Build quality is solid, and Toyota trucks are known for their mechanical durability. Although warranty coverage isn't generous, you do get two years of free scheduled maintenance. Toyota's Tacoma manages to deliver fun in a right-size pickup package. Its TRD off-road packages are the real deal, not sticker packages inflated by marketing hype. The buying public has responded with fierce loyalty, and this truck has also attracted the attention of the aftermarket, which supports it with many products that enable all sorts of customization. The Tacoma is great for those who want the look and feel of an off-roader even if they'll never get it dirty because it's also an easy-driving and dependable pickup truck.",

    "full_description": "The  RAV4 Prime is a jack-of-all-trades compact crossover SUV, fulfilling a variety  of roles that would usually take two or three vehicles. It offers  emissions-free electric range, hybrid efficiency for longer trips, and enough  cargo and passenger room to be suitable for families. And on top of that it  packs plenty of punch, with 302 combined horsepower from the gas engine and a  pair of electric motors that make the RAV4 Prime the second-quickest vehicle in  the Toyota lineup after the GR Supra, with an as-tested 0-60 mph time of 5.9  seconds. \nThink  of the RAV4 Prime as a tuned-up version of the RAV4 Hybrid. It has a larger  battery and more powerful electric motors that give it a robust 42 miles of EPA-estimated  electric range and then 38 combined mpg once that's exhausted.  In our testing, the RAV4 Prime beat  that mark easily and covered 48 miles on just the battery. That also puts the  RAV4 Prime comfortably ahead of its plug-in SUV counterparts, besting the  Hyundai Tucson PHEV (33 miles), Kia Sportage PHEV (32 miles) and even the Volvo  XC60 T8 Extended Range (36 miles) by healthy margins.\nThere  are a few caveats: The rest of the driving experience isn't as dialed in  \u2014 our testers noted its mushy brakes and subpar handling. But those  aren't usually priorities if you're shopping in this class, and overall cabin  comfort and quietness are good (except for when the gas engine really gets  going). The RAV4 Prime does have slightly less cargo room than the standard  RAV4 with 33.5 cubic feet of cargo space compared to 37.6 cubic feet, but  that's still plenty of room for large items.\nPlease note that this rating was  conducted on a pre-2023 RAV4 Prime. We'll update the score once we test the  RAV4's new touchscreen. We  like the idea of a fully loaded RAV4 Prime, but the XSE just doesn't have  enough additional features to justify the significant upcharge. Plus, the RAV4  Prime already starts at an elevated price point compared to other compact SUVs.  Unless you have to have it all, the entry-level SE will suit most people just fine. How does the RAV4 Prime drive? The RAV4 Prime gets up to speed much better than its standard or hybrid siblings. In Edmunds' testing, it reached 60 mph in an impressively quick 5.9 seconds. The regular RAV4, for example, needs a comparatively unhurried 8.9 seconds. The RAV4 Prime is also smooth and easy to drive under typical commuting conditions. \n\n   Unfortunately, Toyota has failed to back up the muscular powertrain with any sort of dynamic athleticism. Handling is pretty abysmal, with prevalent body roll and vague steering that makes it hard to judge the right amount of input. The electronic driver assistants also freak out at the smallest provocation. Another demerit comes from the brakes. The RAV4 Prime's pedal feel is overly soft. Panic-stopping performance in our testing was below average for a small SUV. How comfortable is the RAV4 Prime? The driver's seat has enough adjustments to allow you to easily find a comfortable seating position. But the front passenger seat has fewer adjustments, which might lead to a few complaints on long trips. The available synthetic leather upholstery (Toyota's SofTex) breathes well and is definitely helped on hot days by the available seat ventilation. The rear seats are also praiseworthy for the better-than-average thigh support. \n\n   The RAV4 Prime's ride quality is biased more toward comfort than performance, delivering a smooth ride over road imperfections. Road and wind noise is abated to pleasant levels, though the gasoline engine sounds unrefined when you're aggressively accelerating. Otherwise, it's pleasantly muted. How\u2019s the interior? The RAV4 Prime gets strong scores here. The controls are well labeled and logically grouped for easy operation. The drive modes don't explain what they fully do (you'll definitely need to read the manual), but every other system is very intuitive. The ideal ride height and big door openings help with getting in and out. Shorter passengers can get in easily and taller people won't have to stoop to enter. \n\n   There is enough headroom and legroom for 6-footers in any seat. Forward visibility is praiseworthy thanks to narrow front windshield pillars, but the side view is obscured by the thick pillar between the front and rear doors. One other gripe is that the touchscreen is too far away from the driver. How\u2019s the tech? The available 9-inch screen makes most infotainment interactions quick, easy and distraction-free. It's quick to react, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard. The size and placement of physical shortcut buttons could be improved for less distraction. The JBL audio upgrade will get you stronger bass and clarity, but it's not all that impressive. \n\n   Toyota's advanced driver aids generally function as they should. We're especially fond of the traffic-adaptive cruise control that proves its worth whether you're on a free-flowing highway or stuck in traffic. But the lane keeping assistance feature tends to add too much steering effort for anything but straight highway cruising. How\u2019s the storage? The RAV4 Prime takes a small hit when it comes to cargo capacity, accommodating 33.5 cubic feet as opposed to the standard RAV4's 37.6 cubic feet. Still, there's plenty of space for all your luggage, and you can fold the rear seats down with minimal effort. Interior storage is helped by some extra shelves cut into the dash, a wireless charging pad, and a good-size center armrest bin. \n\n   Parents with young kids will appreciate the RAV4. It's easy to locate and connect safety seats to the lower car seat anchors. Likewise, tethering to the three upper anchors is straightforward. Forward-facing seats and boosters fit readily, but installing a rear-facing infant seat on the passenger side will likely require scooting the front seat up. The too-high front passenger seat is the issue. How\u2019s the fuel economy? On our standardized evaluation route, the RAV4 Prime easily logged 48 miles of electric-only propulsion (6 miles better than the EPA estimate). That's enough to cover most people's average commute and daily driving. Once the gas engine kicked in, we averaged about 34 mpg, which is similar to the RAV4 Hybrid. You can also likely drive nearly 600 miles with a full tank of gas and fully charged battery. Is the RAV4 Prime a good value? The RAV4 Prime is quite a bit more expensive than the regular RAV4. It will take a while to recoup the cost of a Prime compared to buying a regular RAV4 Hybrid based on gas savings alone. \n\n   The Prime's build quality is good enough to justify the price, and some nice touches are exclusive to this plug-in hybrid model. The warranty for hybrid components is extended past Toyota's usual coverage. Two years of free scheduled maintenance is also included. As disappointing as the RAV4 Prime may be when it comes to performance and driving entertainment, it's an admirable plug-in hybrid SUV. Its easily achieved 42-mile all-electric range almost doubles that of its closest rivals (Kia Niro and Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV). It certainly doesn't hurt that it gets up to highway speeds quickly, and the sharp styling might attract shoppers away from the less traditional competition.",

    "full_description": "The  Toyota Sienna minivan has been around for decades, but the current model  debuted just a couple of years ago. There's a lot to like with this latest  Sienna. It's actually a hybrid, and that means it gets better fuel economy than  most rival minivans. The EPA estimates that the Sienna gets 36 mpg in combined  driving, versus 26 mpg combined for the Honda Odyssey. On top of that you get  the typical Sienna advantages such as seating for up to eight passengers and  available all-wheel drive. It won't get you as many places as an SUV, but the  Sienna offers as much space and cargo room as all but the largest of those.   There  aren't any significant updates for the core Sienna lineup, but the 2023 Sienna  does introduce a new version to celebrate the nameplate's 25th anniversary.  Aptly named the 25th Anniversary Edition, this Sienna combines the sportier  styling of the XSE trim level with the Limited's fully stocked feature set. It  also has special badging and floor mats specific to the 25th Anniversary  Edition. Only 2,525 will be produced and come exclusively with white or silver  exterior paint.\u00a0  There aren't many minivans on the  market anymore, but those that are still around are pretty competitive. You  might check out the Honda Odyssey, which is quicker and more enjoyable to drive  than the Sienna, or the Chrysler Pacifica, which is unique for the class by  offering a plug-in hybrid powertrain that offers an EPA-estimated 32 miles of  all-electric driving range, plenty for running around town during the day. The  Kia Carnival is another newer segment entry and offers exceptional value for  money. Is the Sienna the best for you? Check out our test team's Expert Rating  below for a full rundown of its biggest advantages and drawbacks. The XLE trim is the one to get since it  adds a lot of comfort and convenience features for the money. There are enough  additions to make it feel much nicer than the base LE trim, and it's also  eligible for some options including a rear entertainment system. How does the Sienna drive? The Sienna's hybrid-only powertrain means it's ultra smooth to accelerate but also a lot slower than its peers, taking an extra second to reach 60 mph compared to most other vans (including the outgoing Sienna with a V6). This slower acceleration isn't evident when you're just cruising around town. But you'll notice it when you're merging onto the highway or going up grades.     The Sienna isn't the most nimble minivan in the class, but it holds its own. It drives more like a car than an SUV. The steering is weighted well to cruise for hours down the highway. It's also light and easy to turn during low-speed maneuvers.    Emergency braking performance is OK, but the bigger deal is the pedal's sometimes awkward grabby feel. That can make it hard to consistently stop smoothly. How comfortable is the Sienna? We had no complaints after spending hours in the driver's seat. Its wide range of adjustability gets much of the credit, though this is a common feature in the class. Optional ottoman-style footrests in the second row plus a huge range of fore-aft sliding create a business-class-like feel and give the Sienna an edge in second-row comfort. Optional four-zone climate control is one more zone than competitors have (three-zone is standard) and it's effective at keeping the cabin cozy, hot or cold.    Noise is an area of concern. So long as the engine isn't working hard, the cabin is quiet, even serene. When you ask for power, the whole cabin will know. The engine and continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) drone considerably. Optional in-car voice projection, which sends front passenger voices through the rear speakers and headsets, helps as a work-around. You can save the shouting for when you really need it. How\u2019s the interior? The Sienna pulls ahead of the pack in this area. It sits at a height that makes it easy to slide in and out of. The driving position is excellent and versatile. We're fans of the large central touchscreen with two exceptions: the glare that it throws off in midday sun and some far-side buttons that feel a bit out of reach. All other primary controls are placed logically and function as expected.    There's naturally good visibility out of the cabin. An optional surround-view camera system can provide a see-through view of the Sienna to make things even easier. There's also a digital rearview mirror that solves the issue of seeing past headrests or high-piled cargo in the back. The sliding doors and rear hatch have a no-touch open and closing feature. Just swipe your foot to operate them. How\u2019s the tech? The infotainment system uses a combination of a quick-responding touchscreen and physical buttons. The redundancy lets you choose your preference for menu access. The native navigation is accurate and easy to read, and the system's voice commands respond well to natural language. Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration is also standard.    Interior tech features worth mentioning include a handy cabin intercom system, Wi-Fi connectivity and a generous number of USB ports for all three rows. We found the advanced driving aids to be excellent too. Adaptive cruise control is tuned well to avoid the heavy and sudden brake application we see from some other brands. How\u2019s the storage? All minivans are masters of utility, and the Sienna is no exception. There's a deep well for cargo storage behind the third row that also has hooks on the seatback. The third row can be manually folded and stows almost flat into the floor, and the second-row seats slide far forward, offering a great cargo solution. One big drawback is the second-row seats aren't removable as they are in other minivans, which greatly reduces the maximum cargo capacity.    Storage for personal items is equally good. There are 16 cupholders, multi-level door pockets, and a large shelf between the front passengers that is perfect for a handbag. For car seats, the attachment points are extremely easy to access. There are four in the seven-passenger Sienna and five in the eight-passenger. Buckles are easy for booster-age kids to use. How\u2019s the fuel economy? Chrysler gave us the first plug-in minivan. If you ran out of EV charge, its hybrid mode still returned an EPA-estimated 30 mpg. That was mind-blowing minivan fuel economy at the time. But the new hybrid Sienna is estimated by the EPA at 36 mpg combined (36 city/36 highway). And as we discovered, it's capable of much more.     After nearly 500 miles with a front-wheel-drive Sienna, we vastly outperformed the EPA estimates. We averaged 42.7 mpg overall, including 44.8 mpg on our mixed-driving evaluation route of just over 115 miles. We can't wait to see if the all-wheel-drive version performs as well. Wow. Is the Sienna a good value? Our Sienna test vehicle wasn't a final production unit, but it felt really well built and was free of squeaks and rattles. Surfaces that are frequently touched \u2014 steering wheel, armrests, etc. \u2014 are soft-touch and well padded. All these aspects add to the general upscale sense you get from this interior.    Though a base Sienna starts a bit higher than other base models, it's comparably priced when its peers are equipped with features to match. The top trim is a tad more expensive but offers value-added features such as all-wheel drive that some competitors don't. It has a strong warranty for hybrid components and roadside assistance, and it's the only one to offer two years of free scheduled maintenance. For those who prioritize how a car drives, the Sienna's brakes may be a deal-breaker. Sometimes they grab too much, sometimes too little, and sometimes they work fine. This factor carries a lot of weight for us and is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise great minivan.    That aside, the Sienna gets a lot of the fundamentals right and offers some bonus elements too. Its exterior styling certainly shows more personality than any other minivan. And some of its more novel interior features include a built-in vacuum, a refrigerator that gets legitimately cold for drinks and snacks, and second-row seats that recline with footrests like you're in an airline business class. Oh, and we've seen this hybrid get well over 40 mpg. That's a wild card if we've ever seen one.",

    "full_description": "The  Toyota Camry Hybrid is a four-door sedan and one of the most fuel-efficient  cars on the road. Getting around 50 mpg in combined city/highway driving  shouldn't be too much trouble unless you're one to treat your commutes and  errands as time trials for a Formula One race. On top of its fuel-sipping, the  Camry Hybrid delivers all of the positive attributes of the regular Camry,  including roomy and comfortable seats and an easy-to-drive nature. While  some automakers are dropping sedans from their lineups in favor of SUVs, there  are still a handful of hybrid sedans available. Notably, there's Toyota's new  Crown, which is larger and more powerful than the Camry but respectably  fuel-efficient. Toyota has also released the redesigned Prius for 2023, and it  boasts stylish looks and even better fuel economy. Honda is out with a new  hybrid-powered Accord too. The Camry Hybrid is a bit of a wallflower among this  set but could be worth a look if you just want a simple sedan with high mpg.  Read our Expert Rating below for our test team's more in-depth review of the  2023 Camry Hybrid. While  some of the other trims might offer sportier looks or more amenities, we  suggest going with the base LE trim.  It's the most affordable model in the lineup. It's also the most efficient,  with an EPA-estimated fuel economy of 52 mpg combined compared with 46 mpg for  every other trim. The LE comes with a decent list of standard features and a  good array of driver aids. How does the Camry Hybrid drive? There's goodness in broad swaths with the Camry Hybrid. The sedan's power is decent in day-to-day use. In our testing, we measured a 0-60 mph time of about 8 seconds, which is slightly better than average for a midsize hybrid sedan.     Hybrid performance is smooth and care-free. Braking is predictable and very usable in everyday applications, and the low-rolling-resistance tires, which are common in this class, also provide average braking distances. Steering and handling are decent for the class. Overall, it's acceptable from a performance standpoint, but day-to-day commuting is its main strength. How comfortable is the Camry Hybrid? Comfort is where any midsize sedan should shine and the Camry Hybrid does just that. The climate control creates a welcome environment, and the seating comfortably accommodates a range of body types. The optional ventilated seats are a boon in warmer climates, and there's very little noise in the cabin coming from wind or the road at highway speeds.    Our only nitpick is the XLE Hybrid's ride comfort. It's great around town but can sometimes feel overly buoyant at highway speeds. The extra weight of the hybrid system is evident. How\u2019s the interior? Inviting, roomy and easy to live with are good hallmarks to have in such a competitive class, and the Camry has them all. The interior is easy to use, and all controls are readily within reach. The driving position is largely adaptable, and most people should easily find a comfortable position behind the wheel. Getting in and out of the vehicle is a cinch due to generous door openings, and there's a good amount of interior room for both front and rear occupants and excellent visibility for the driver. How\u2019s the tech? The Camry Hybrid's smartphone integration includes standard Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa. Both the standard 7-inch and optional 9-inch infotainment touchscreens are easy to read and operate. Built-in navigation is offered on higher trims if you want it. Three USB ports and the option to add a wireless charger should provide plenty of charge for all occupants on the road.    All Camrys come with Toyota's Safety Sense 2.5+. It's an impressive suite of standard driver assistance features such as adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking and lane keeping assistance. Previously, some of these systems have been too sensitive for our liking, but they were refined for 2021 and work much better. How\u2019s the storage? The Camry Hybrid has a full-size trunk with no intrusion from a battery pack whatsoever. With the trunk open, you can't tell it apart from a standard Camry. Hybrid sedans usually force you to give up some practicality, but not this one. The 15.1-cubic-foot trunk area is smaller than the Accord Hybrid's (16.7 cubic feet), but the wide opening with a low liftover height helps you make the most of the space.    The cabin offers a good amount of storage, from the sliding compartment underneath the wireless charger to a nicely sized center armrest bin, plus a small bonus storage cubby on the far left-hand side of the dash. There's also ample room for a car safety seat, along with easily accessible anchors for speedy installation. How\u2019s the fuel economy? EPA-estimated fuel economy for an XLE Hybrid (which is what we tested) is 46 mpg. That's a solid number for a midsize hybrid sedan. The base LE car returns an even more impressive 52 mpg. By comparison, the Honda Accord Hybrid gets an estimated 43 or 47 mpg, depending on the trim level. We yielded about 42.4 mpg during our time with our XLE test car, which doesn't quite hit the mark but is decently efficient. Is the Camry Hybrid a good value? Long the strong point for Toyota, there's good value in the latest Camry Hybrid. Traditional strong Toyota build quality? Check. The interior materials are a nice quality, and the hybrid matches well against the competition in standard warranty and ownership experience.     While the base Camry Hybrid is a little more expensive than the Honda Accord and Hyundai Sonata hybrids, the starting MSRP for the top-spec Camry Hybrid XLE is very cost-effective for this class. The raft of standard safety features and stellar fuel economy are double wins for your wallet. This is as normal and middle-of-the-road as a car can possibly get, yet you get such a huge boost in fuel economy without the usual hallmarks of dare-you-to-buy-it styling and buzzy ride common to extremely fuel-efficient cars. It isn't fun to drive in a traditional sense, but it is fulfilling in the sense that you're doing something for the environment (if that's something you care about) and doing it in comfort.",

    "full_description": "Year  after year, the Toyota RAV4 is one of the best-selling SUVs on the market.  Toyota's reputation for reliability certainly has a lot to do with its success.  But we also praise this small SUV for its roomy interior, comfortable ride and  easy-to-use technology features. There are also a wide array of available trim  levels to suit your budget or interests. The RAV4 TRD Off-Road trim, for  example, is one of the few models in its class to offer enhanced off-road  capabilities by way of its all-terrain tires and special suspension  alterations. \nFor  2023, the RAV4 looks the same as it did last year, but there are some notable  changes inside. A new infotainment system debuts with improved graphics, more  intuitive menus and over-the-air software updates. Both the standard and  upgraded touchscreens also get slightly larger too. Other upgrades include  wireless phone integration and a new digital instrument panel.\nHowever,  we don't expect these changes to dramatically improve the Toyota RAV4's  standing among other small SUVs. It's certainly a likable SUV but we've found  rivals such as the Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5 and Nissan Rogue to be better  all-around picks. You can learn more about the RAV4's hits and misses by  reading our test team's Expert Rating below.  We  recommend the XLE Premium trim. In  addition to all of the features found in the supporting LE and XLE models, you  get some desirable updates that include a power liftgate, a sunroof and  synthetic leather upholstery. How does the RAV4 drive? The RAV4 doesn't impress here, unfortunately. The engine is willing around town, and passing and merging are drama-free. But if you're in a huge rush, you might notice the engine's ultimately modest power delivery. In Edmunds' testing, our RAV4 Adventure test vehicle needed 9.1 seconds to cover 0-60 mph, which is slightly slower than the class average.\n\n   Another gripe we have is with the steering, which is vague at the center point and doesn't have appropriate levels of feel and heft. As such, it's easy to misjudge your level of input. In better news, the RAV4's optional upgraded all-wheel-drive system includes rear-axle torque vectoring and more advanced traction control systems with selectable terrain settings and hill descent control. These systems, plus respectable ground clearance, give the RAV4 Adventure above-average off-road ability for a small SUV. How comfortable is the RAV4? The RAV4's suspension is tuned to strike a good balance between control and softness. The body doesn't bound or float when you drive over bumps, and small to moderate impacts are absorbed without much drama. As for the front seats, they are nicely sculpted and padded appropriately, but the seat bottoms begin to feel flat on longer drives. The passenger side's lack of adjustment can also make it difficult to find a comfortable position.\n\n   At highway speeds, the RAV4 is generally quiet. The exception is when you hit the gas for a burst of speed, at which point the engine sound gets rather coarse. We do like the climate system's performance. Air distribution is ideal, with forward vents that can be closed off completely and vents for the rear seat. How\u2019s the interior? The driving position, roominess, and ease of getting in and out are all good. But the RAV4 would score higher if the front passenger seat wasn't set so high or could be adjusted down on most trims. Only the RAV4 Limited gets a power-adjustable front passenger seat. The driver's seat and steering wheel have a good range of adjustment, but tall drivers might want a smidge more adjustability. Outward visibility is praiseworthy.\n\n   The control layout is intuitive with large, easy-to-read labeling. The audio system and climate system controls are islands unto themselves, and everything else is right where you expect it to be. The big rubberized climate control knobs are nice too. Our only gripe is that the touchscreen is too far away from the driver. The tuning knob, in particular, requires a reach to twist. How\u2019s the tech? The RAV4's interface has a mix of touchscreen and fixed buttons, and both are easy to learn without consulting the owner's manual. But even though the RAV4 is relatively new, the touchscreen's graphics look dated. The sound system works well enough, but it's nothing special. You do get standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. It's a good thing too since Toyota's native Entune software remains clunky.\n\n   The standard suite of driver aids is impressive. It includes adaptive cruise control that works down to 0 mph, automatic emergency braking, drowsy driver detection, automatic high beams, lane keeping assist and something called Line Tracing Assist, which is an active (but not hands-free) steering aid. How\u2019s the storage? The RAV4's cargo hold is nearly the biggest in its class. You get 37.5 cubic feet with the rear seats up and 69.8 cubic feet with them stowed. The RAV4 is also easy to load thanks to a low cargo floor. Up front, the cabin has numerous shelves and bins to handle assorted road-trip paraphernalia. If you're planning on towing, certain versions of the RAV4 can pull up to 3,500 pounds, which is above average for a small SUV.\n\n   Parents with young kids will appreciate the RAV4. It's easy to locate and connect safety seats to the lower car seat anchors. Likewise, tethering to the three upper anchors is straightforward. Forward-facing seats and boosters fit readily, but installing a rear-facing infant seat on the passenger side will likely require scooting the front seat up. The too-high front passenger seat is the issue. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates the RAV4 will get 28-30 mpg in combined city/highway driving, depending on the powertrain and trim level. We drove an AWD Adventure carrying three people, equipment and luggage for more than 7,000 miles. And over a variety of road and weather conditions, we averaged 28.6 mpg. Our best tank was 32.3 mpg and the worst was 25.6 mpg. Is the RAV4 a good value? The RAV4 is well built inside, with nice layered materials and seams that are invisible because they're built into the styling. It has tactile touches such as rubberized grip surfaces on the interior door pulls and the radio and climate knobs. The RAV4's optional simulated leather upholstery feels soft and pliable, and the stitching is tidy. Toyota's warranty coverage is average, but you do get a generous two years/25,000 miles of free scheduled maintenance. Driving a RAV4 isn't a chore, but it's not particularly memorable either. It's at its best when you go with the Adventure or TRD Off-Road trim level. The advanced torque vectoring all-wheel-drive system, capable traction control system with multiple terrain settings, and styling that's a little more rugged help the RAV4 stand out a little more.",

    "full_description": "The  2023 Toyota bZ4X is the automaker's first mass-produced electric vehicle and is  currently the only EV the brand offers. It's a small SUV that's about the size  of a RAV4 and is closely related to the all-new Subaru Solterra. This Toyota EV  has some appealing qualities, but it's also not quite the home run you might  have otherwise expected considering how long it's taken Toyota to finally roll  it out. \nThis  electric SUV produces 201 horsepower in the front-wheel-drive model and 214 hp  with all-wheel drive. Neither figure is particularly noteworthy. The same goes  for range. Depending on the configuration you get, the bZ4X has an  EPA-estimated driving range of 222-252 miles. That's OK, but other EVs go  farther, and we found the bZ4X's Edmunds-tested real-world range to be  disappointing. \nOn  the upside, Toyota has made the bZ4X feel familiar and comfortable. If you like  the idea of driving a RAV4 that happens to be electric, this could be the EV  for you. It also comes with lots of standard technology and driver assist  features. But overall we recommend checking out more highly rated models such  as the aforementioned Ford Mustang Mach-E and Tesla Model Y plus the all-new  Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6. Check out our test team's Expert Rating below to  get more detail on where the bZ4X shines and where it falls short. The  2023 Toyota bZ4X is offered in two trim levels, and we recommend opting for the  well-equipped XLE trim. Besides  coming with a full suite of advanced driver aids, the base XLE trim also comes  equipped with a 12.3-inch touchscreen, wireless charging pad, digital  instrument panel, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. Add  the XLE Weather package for heated front seats and a heated steering wheel. How does the bZ4X drive? For better or worse, the bZ4X feels more like a regular SUV, such as a Toyota RAV4, than it does an actual EV. It's quicker than most small gas-powered SUVs but slower than most rival EVs such as the Tesla Model Y or Ford Mustang Mach-E. There's enough power to for driving around town or getting up to highway speeds, but by the numbers the bZ4X is objectively slower than other EVs. \n\n   The brakes provide adequate stopping power, but we found the pedal a bit soft and inconsistent, making it hard to stop smoothly every time. Another downside is the lack of full one-pedal driving. Many EVs can use their regenerative braking to slow down (rather than just coast) and come to a full stop when you lift off the accelerator. We've found this makes driving easier, but in the bZ4X you have to slow down by using the brake pedal. We can understand the rationale \u2014 make the bZ4X seem familiar \u2014 but it's a missed opportunity in our opinion.\n\n   Steering and handling are middling. The steering wheel itself is surprisingly small for a crossover SUV, though it doesn't do much to make the bZ4X itself feel small or agile. It's light and quick enough that parking is a cinch, but the lack of road feel and soft suspension fail to provide any appreciable amount of engagement. How comfortable is the bZ4X? The bZ4X has a smooth ride quality and is pretty comfortable over bumps. The front seats are also nice thanks to soft padding, sufficient support to keep you secure when cornering, and enough adjustments to suit most people's preferred driving position. The rear seat is comfortable as well, with a nicely padded bench that should keep backseat passengers happy. \n\n   On the road, the bZ4X is fairly quiet, though other EVs do a better job of keeping wind and road noise out of the cabin. The bZ4X also goes overboard with all types of warning beeps. And unfortunately you can't turn those off.\n\n   The climate control system is easy to use, and it quickly heats or cools the cabin. We also like the button on the key fob that can get the climate control going remotely, something other automakers usually leave for a smartphone app. Our test vehicle had heated and ventilated front seats, both of which worked well. How\u2019s the interior? The bZ4X's interior is conservative in terms of design and innovation, though that's not necessarily a bad thing. The touchscreen interface is a step up from what Toyota has been using for the past few years in most of its vehicles. The screen isn't as big as what some rivals offer, but it's sharp and responsive, and the menu structure itself is easy to navigate. Not everything is tied to the touchscreen, and we're happy that Toyota uses actual buttons for some of the controls rather than putting everything into the touchscreen. \n\n   On paper, the bZ4X's interior isn't as spacious as those of its rivals, but in reality there's plenty of space in either row for all but the tallest of passengers. The space and tallish ride height make getting in and out a breeze. The center console is tall, but otherwise there's plenty of room up front to stretch out. Visibility is good thanks to tall windows and large mirrors. The lack of a rear window wiper is odd on an SUV, and some staff testers aren't enamored with high-mounted instrument display. How\u2019s the tech? The navigation system is responsive and easy to operate, and it uses Google-derived info for points of interest and other locations. Over-the-air updates make sure the information stays fresh too. You can input navigation directions either manually or with the built-in voice commands. Voice controls can also be used to adjust the climate control system, audio and more. Our test bZ4X had the premium JBL audio system, but we were underwhelmed with its sound quality. \n\n   There are plenty of ways to connect your phone. The bZ4X has four USB-C ports, one USB-A port and a wireless charging pad. Additionally, Toyota offers wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. \n\n   The bZ4X's advanced driver aids all work well and are easy to operate. The adaptive cruise control changes speeds smoothly and can maintain a tight gap behind the car in front. Other driver aids, such as lane keeping assist, work well too. Our only major complaint is about the overly eager parking sensors that beep incessantly in parking lots. How\u2019s the storage? There is 27.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seat (or 25.8 cubic feet when the bZ4X is equipped with the JBL audio system). That's an average amount for the class, but the space itself is wide and usable. The load floor can be lowered, too, which is helpful given that the sleek roofline limits how tall items can be. There's also no front trunk like you get with the Tesla Model Y or Ford Mustang Mach-E. \n\n   Storage for smaller items in the cabin is so-so. The center console is smaller than those of some rivals, and the storage shelf beneath the shifter isn't deep enough to keep taller items in place. The door pockets are decently sized but, somewhat oddly, the bZ4X lacks a glovebox for closed storage. Got small kids? The spacious rear seat should make installing a child safety seat relatively easy. There's plenty of room for a rear-facing seat, and the anchors themselves are easy to access. How are the range and efficiency? The bZ4X has an EPA-estimated range that varies between 222 miles and 252 miles depending on the trim and whether it has all-wheel drive. Our front-wheel-drive bZ4X Limited test vehicle was rated at 242 miles. In Edmunds' real-world EV range testing, the Toyota traveled a disappointing 227 miles of range from full a battery charge. That's one of the worst results we've seen from any EV we've tested and well off what we've seen from some class leaders. \n\n   Our observed use of electricity was off from the EPA's estimates too. The government says the bZ4X should use about 26 kWh of electricity for every 100 miles of driving. On our dedicated EV test route, we measured 28.5 kWh used. (Remember that the higher the kWh number, the less efficient the EV is.) For comparison, a Chevrolet Bolt we tested used 25.7 kWh/100 miles.\n\n   In terms of DC fast charging, the front-wheel-drive bZ4X charges at a maximum of 150 kW, which is pretty good for an EV in this price range and should speed up charging times in ideal conditions. Oddly, the all-wheel-drive model is limited to 100 kW. That means for a BZ4X with AWD you should expect to recharge from a low battery to 80% in about one hour. Is the bZ4X a good value? The bZ4X starts in the mid-$40,000s which is on par for EVs in this class. The base bZ4X comes reasonably well equipped, and our near-$50K test vehicle was loaded with just about every available option. But we don't think you're really getting your money's worth here. The interior doesn't feel as premium as the cabins of the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6. Those vehicles all cost about the same as the Toyota and offer similar features and much more range.\n\n   Toyota backs every bZ4X with a three-year/36,000-mile basic warranty as well as a five-year/50,000-mile powertrain warranty and eight years of coverage for the battery. All are about average for the class. The automaker also includes two years/50,000 miles of roadside assistance and scheduled maintenance. One nice plus is Toyota's inclusion of a year of free charging at EVgo stations. The bZ4X's styling is reasonably attractive in our opinion. It's not as eye-catching as the Ioniq 5, EV6 or Mach-E, but that might be a good thing for some people. It also doesn't look all that much different than Toyota's other crossovers or the jointly developed Subaru Solterra. We just wish it had more personality elsewhere. While it's quick relative to a lot of gasoline-powered crossovers, it's slower than and not nearly as fun to drive as other EVs. If you want to have fun behind the wheel of something electric, we suggest looking elsewhere.",

    "full_description": "The  2023 Toyota Tundra full-size pickup is coming off a full redesign just last  year. It has significantly more power, capabilities and comfort than the  generation before it, but that shouldn't be too surprising since that  predecessor had been kicking around since 2007. One of the most significant  improvements is the new turbocharged  V6 engine that has about as much power as the old Tundra's V8 but generates  more torque, which is helpful for towing, and boasts considerably better  EPA-estimated fuel economy. There's also an optional hybrid V6  powertrain that gives the  Tundra even more muscle over the standard V6. For  2023, the Tundra's changes are predictably light. So far, it's limited to a new  SX package for the SR5 trim. The SX package gives the Tundra a stealthy look,  with dark gray wheels and body-colored door handles and rear bumper. Given  that, we think the Tundra is an agreeable choice for a light-duty pickup. But  the rival Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 have some advantages that could make them a  better buy. Check out our test team's Expert Rating below for a complete  rundown of the latest Tundra's hits and misses. We  suggest the midrange Limited trim  out of the Tundra's lineup. You not only get a larger infotainment touchscreen  and a smoother ride from hydraulic cab mounts, but it's also the least  expensive way to get the optional hybrid powertrain. How does the Tundra Hybrid drive? The Tundra TRD Pro gets a hybrid powertrain called iForce Max that adds an additional 48 hp and 104 lb-ft of torque over the regular turbocharged V6 engine. That helped our test truck accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 6.2 seconds, a bit quicker than the standard Tundra (6.6 seconds). However, the F-150 with its hybrid powertrain is quicker still (5.7 seconds in our testing).\n\n   The Tundra's 10-speed automatic transmission shifts unobtrusively and promptly, and the brakes are easy to control and bring the truck down to a smooth stop in city traffic. Emergency braking is less impressive \u2014 our TRD Pro test truck needed a lengthy 141 feet to stop from 60 mph \u2014 but much of that can be attributed to the Pro's all-terrain tires. Those tires do help boost the Tundra's off-road capability a bit, as do the upgraded shock absorbers, increased ride height and locking rear differential. How comfortable is the Tundra Hybrid? The Tundra crew cab is suitably comfortable for drivers and passengers. Space is abundant and the front seats have no problem areas. Like the standard Tundra, the TRD Pro version is composed and comfortable. You'll feel cracks and bumps, and the large all-terrain tires are noisy at certain speeds, but in general the ride quality is pretty smooth for a full-size truck. \n\n   The interior is relatively well insulated from outside noise, which is important because such a large truck \u2014 with both electric whine and two turbochargers, along with those all-terrain tires \u2014 can create a lot of noise. You will hear all of that hardware but won't need to yell to hold a conversation. Finally, the climate system is largely set it and forget it, and the controls are sensibly arranged and easy to locate. How\u2019s the interior? While the optional 14-inch touchscreen certainly gets your attention, the Tundra's straightforward interior layout and overall ease of use leave a more lasting impression. Gauges and graphics are easy to read at a glance, and the commanding driving position makes piloting the full-size Tundra much less daunting. Like all full-size trucks, the Tundra offers ample room for all passengers, especially in the CrewMax body style. \n\n   When equipped with the optional panoramic sunroof and full-width power rear window, the Tundra feels downright airy and spacious. Even with the Tundra's sizable hood, forward visibility is generally good. But the truck's chunky windshield pillars can easily block your view on two-lane roads. We recommend getting the Tundra's surround-view camera system since it makes maneuvering the truck in tight spots a lot easier. How\u2019s the tech? The Tundra's optional 14-inch touchscreen is a standout feature. It has crisp-looking graphics, and its various onscreen menus are easy to use. In fact, we'd wager some smartphone users might even prefer the native setup to Apple CarPlay or Android Auto (which come standard) for most features. Our test truck had the upgraded JBL audio system. It's a solid system, but the standard audio system is pretty good too.\n\n   The Tundra's advanced driver aids, most of which come standard, generally work well. We didn't experience any false alarms in our testing. The only letdown was the lane keeping assistance, which wasn't particularly useful in keeping this big truck centered between lane markers. How are the towing and storage? Without question, the Tundra is a capable truck. Our off-road-focused TRD Pro test vehicle was slightly compromised, however. Its maximum towing capacity and max hauling capacity are lower than other models in the lineup. But the TRD Pro provides plenty of confidence with a load, as we experienced, and its composite bed is a helpful feature for extra strength and protection.\n\n   The Tundra has big doors in its CrewMax configuration that allows for easy loading. But because the TRD Pro has a large hybrid battery underneath the rear seats, it's not possible to store anything in that area. Plenty of rivals offer additional storage there. The Tundra also lacks some clever storage options inside for front passengers. How economical is the Tundra Hybrid? In its TRD Pro trim, the Tundra may come with a gasoline-electric hybrid powertrain, but it's hardly a fuel-sipper. Electric power is mainly used to create additional horsepower and torque, and even attempting to coast on EV juice fails to improve efficiency much. The EPA estimates Tundra TRD Pro will get 19 mpg in combined city/highway driving. This is decent for a full-size truck, especially considering how much power it makes. But you'll be left wanting if you expect great fuel economy because of the hybrid powertrain. We also weren't able to match the EPA's estimate in substantial real-world driving. Is the Tundra Hybrid a good value? The price of entry is high for the Pro, and other models within the Tundra lineup provide better value. The good news is Toyota hit all the right marks with fit and finish. The Tundra has a distinctive interior that is well-put-together, and the TRD Pro delivers a lot of off-road-ready equipment.\n\n   Toyota backs up the Tundra with a three-year/36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and five-year/60,000-mile coverage for the powertrain. This coverage is about average for the class, though free maintenance for two years/25,000 miles is an added plus. The Tundra TRD Pro's strong power, upgraded off-road prowess, and surprising level of comfort give you lots of capability and luxury. This truck doesn't necessarily excel in any one area, but diehard Tundra fans and even newcomers to the nameplate will find plenty to connect with.",

    "full_description": "The 2023 Toyota C-HR is one of Toyota's smallest and  lowest priced crossover SUVs. The 2023 model year marks the sixth year of  production. While Toyota hasn't announced any official changes, we don't expect  any major updates for 2023. A redesign would normally be in the cards, but  Toyota's recent introduction of the Corolla Cross complicates things as the two  models essentially compete against each other. \nThe  C-HR feels its age when stacked up against most rivals, Corolla Cross included.  It has a higher base price than most of the competition and lacks some of the  features we expect from this class of SUV. The Chevrolet Trailblazer, Kia Soul,  Mazda CX-30 and Volkswagen Taos are all strong options. Check out our Expert  Rating below to learn more about the C-HR's hits and misses. Toyota  hasn't released official information on the 2023 as of this writing. We'll  update our recommendation if anything changes, but based on last year's C-HR we  suggest going with the base XLE trim  level. The Limited trim adds some creature comforts, but we don't think it's  worth the premium. How does the C-HR drive? It's difficult to recommend a vehicle as sluggish as the Toyota C-HR. Its four-cylinder engine simply can't muster enough power to get the C-HR going with any authority. At Edmunds' test track, we logged a 0-60 mph time of 10.6 seconds. That's slower than other small crossovers and hatchbacks. It's even slower than a Toyota Prius. \n\n   But the C-HR holds its own in other categories. The brake pedal is easy to control, so it's easy to stop smoothly, and the steering is easy to twirl around at low speeds and accurate in sporty situations. The C-HR is also somewhat entertaining to drive on a twisty road even if there's a distinct lack of grip from the tires. How comfortable is the C-HR? The C-HR's seats are well cushioned and supportive, and the suspension smooths out most bumps in the road. The cabin is a pleasant place to be whether you're a driver or passenger.\n\n   That said, the C-HR isn't built for less than perfect conditions. We noticed that larger patches of rough pavement can easily upset the ride quality and create a lot of noise in the cabin. It isn't very well insulated from outside noise, and any wind gusts stronger than a light breeze are quite loud inside. How\u2019s the interior? Getting in and out of the C-HR is easy thanks to its elevated seating position. There's also plenty of headroom up front. The rear seats have enough room to keep regular-size adults in decent comfort, but the thick rear roof pillars might make them feel a little claustrophobic. \n\n   The C-HR's simple control layout is attractive, and the main controls are easy to operate for the most part. But some of the more advanced features such as the adaptive cruise control are a little more difficult to figure out. It's pretty easy to see out of the front of the C-HR, but those thick rear roof pillars obscure your view to the back. How\u2019s the tech? The C-HR comes with an 8-inch touchscreen that is simple to read and operate through the menus. It connects with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto via smartphones, and an effective navigation system is available. The audio system provides decent clarity, but the sound quality, especially for songs with thumping bass, quickly degrades when the volume rises.\n\n   We're fans of the driver safety aids included in the Toyota Safety Sense 2.5 suite, which is standard on all C-HR models. The lane-keeping alert system can be overzealous in its warnings when you're driving on a twisty road, but it's otherwise helpful. The adaptive cruise control is very good at reducing driver fatigue in heavy traffic and can bring the vehicle down to a smooth stop. How\u2019s the storage? Storage space is tight inside the C-HR. Rear trunk space is about average for the class at 19 cubic feet. You can fold down the rear seats to access 37 cubic feet of capacity, but that figure ranks low compared to the competition. Space for small items is adequate up front, though the center console is only average size. The cupholders are on the small side and awkwardly positioned.\n\n   Planning to put kids in the back? Car seat anchors are positioned well, but there's little room to install a rear-facing child safety seat without moving the front seats forward. Overall the C-HR is compromised by its quirky shape and size, and Toyota did not bring any of its trademark smart storage solutions to the table. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates fuel economy at 29 mpg combined (27 city/31 highway), which is about average for the class. We found the rating accurate, and even exceeded it with an average of 33.9 mpg on our 115-mile mixed-driving evaluation route. Is the C-HR a good value? The C-HR offers solid build quality and distinctive materials for the class. We also like the amount of standard safety equipment Toyota includes and the two years of free scheduled maintenance. But the C-HR isn't as affordably priced as some value-minded competitors. The distinctive styling alone earns Toyota points for bravery. Most people fall into one of two categories: They love the C-HR's design, or they hate it. Those who like it will find the rest of the vehicle filled with personality, from swooping dashboard lines to interesting trapezoid designs pressed into the ceiling. But just about everyone will find that the lack of power can sour the driving experience.",

    "full_description": "Toyota bases the 2023 Corolla Cross on its dependable compact car of the same name. The Corolla sedan and hatchback share their basic design, powertrains and more with the Corolla Cross. On top of that, the Corolla Cross provides more cargo space, more ground clearance and available all-wheel drive. It's a small Toyota with plenty of SUV-related appeal and an alternative if you find the bigger RAV4 to be too expensive.  This year's Corolla Cross gets a few changes. For starters, there is a new hybrid model (reviewed separately on Edmunds) that promises improved fuel economy. In addition, Toyota swaps out the old infotainment system for its latest technology. Every trim level comes with an 8-inch touchscreen that's fitted with new functionality, including an improved voice command system and wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 (TSS 3.0) also debuts for 2023, expanding on the previous Safety Sense collection of driver assist and collision avoidance features with a few enhanced capabilities. These changes should help the 2023 Toyota Corolla Cross better distinguish itself from its rivals. Furthermore, now that Toyota has dropped the C-HR from its lineup, the Corolla Cross faces no competition from within the automaker. Overall, we find it to be a decent pick for an extra-small crossover but one that comes up a little short compared to the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Hyundai Kona, Mazda CX-30 and Subaru Crosstrek. Be sure to check out the Edmunds Expert Rating of the Toyota Corolla Cross below, which is based on our testing team's evaluation of this SUV. Of the three versions of the 2023 Corolla Cross, we recommend the LE trim level. It adds several appealing features at a reasonable extra cost, such as alloy wheels, tinted privacy glass, automatic climate control and wireless smartphone charging. In addition, the LE includes a blind-spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert. How does the Corolla Cross drive? Toyota's Corolla Cross is merely OK from a driving standpoint. Our all-wheel-drive test model accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 9.6 seconds. That's pretty slow but not entirely unexpected for a vehicle in this class. Passing at freeway speeds requires a bit of planning. Otherwise, the Corolla Cross is smooth and easy to live with at city speeds.  Sometimes small SUVs offer zippy handling on the account of their smaller size, but not the Corolla Cross. Everything from its steering to braking are tuned for comfort. That might be all you need, but we hoped for just a little more pizazz. How comfortable is the Corolla Cross? The Corolla Cross provides suitable comfort for the daily grind. It absorbs most road bumps without trouble, though on occasion can feel a bit too soft and floaty if the road has consistent undulations. The front seats have decent cushioning but come up a bit short on thigh support for taller drivers. The rear seatbacks are set at a comfortable degree of recline.   There's a noticeable level road noise that enters the cabin at highway speeds. Also, the climate control fan on full blast is very noisy. But on the upside, the air conditioning works great on hot days, and the Corolla Cross has rear air vents, which is not a given in this class. How\u2019s the interior? The Corolla Cross feels spacious in most passenger areas with the surprising exception of rear legroom; it's among the tightest in the class, even compared to much smaller vehicles like the Hyundai Kona. The cabin is otherwise pretty easy to get in and out of, and the interior layout is practical and simple. The 8-inch infotainment touchscreen is easy to use. How\u2019s the tech? The Corolla Cross comes with a solid number of driver assist features. These include adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assistance. Most of the system performed as expected during our testing, and we didn't experience any false alarms. The adaptive cruise's following distance is tuned a bit too conservatively to operate effectively in rush-hour traffic, however. Be ready for other drivers to pull in front of you.   The optional JBL audio system produces decent clarity and punchy bass. There's no onboard navigation system, which is becoming more common these days since many people prefer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. How\u2019s the storage? The Toyota Corolla Cross has generous rear cargo space with 25.2 cubic feet in our all-wheel-drive test vehicle. You can drop down the rear seats to accommodate longer items, but they don't fold completely level with the load floor, as they do in other vehicles. The wide rear opening helps make loading things a breeze. Interior cabin storage for front passengers' items is sufficient. There are plenty of water-bottle-size pockets and a few modestly sized compartments to use.    Got small children? Installing a large child safety seat won't be quite as easy as it is in other SUVs due to the Cross' narrower lower door opening and rear legroom handicap. All anchor points and top tethers are clearly marked and easy to access. And if towing is something you plan to do, the Corolla Cross can move a maximum of 1,500 pounds, which is respectable for this size SUV. How\u2019s the fuel economy? We tested the Corolla Cross with AWD; it gets an EPA-estimated 30 mpg combined. That's slightly above the class average. The base Corolla Cross with front-wheel drive is a bit more frugal at 32 mpg combined. Our test model posted 33 mpg on our 115-mile highway-heavy, mixed-driving evaluation route, indication that the 30 mpg EPA number should be realistic. Is the Corolla Cross a good value? The Corolla Cross provides good value for the class at lower trim levels thanks to its many standard features. The top trims are a little more pricey compared to other models but add a lot of premium features to help justify the cost. Underlying build quality feels solid, but the interior's abundant use of plastic makes it feel a tad cheap.   Toyota's basic and powertrain warranties are par for the course. You get a three-year/36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper and five-year/60,000-mile powertrain coverage. However, the complimentary maintenance plan for two years/25,000 miles with roadside assistance is a nice perk. The Corolla Cross is a vehicle of necessity, not something you buy for emotional satisfaction. It'll serve you well in your daily needs as a practical and comfortable SUV, but it's quite uninspiring to drive. There's not much here that stands out.",

    "full_description": "The  Tacoma is one of Toyota's success stories. Not only does it outsell the Tundra  and 4Runner, it's also the best-selling pickup in the midsize truck segment.  Over the years it has built a fiercely loyal following, and the Tacoma can be  uniquely customized thanks to what seems like an infinite number of aftermarket  products. This is a tough truck with impressive off-road capability and is a  manageable size if you don't want a full-size truck.  \nRumors  of a fully redesigned Tacoma for 2023 have proven untrue, so it continues in  much the same form as last year. The only additions include two appearance  packages that dress up the SR5 trim with either black or chrome embellishments.  Other changes amount to increased availability of a few minor features. These  include a larger touchscreen, keyless entry and a power driver's seat.\u00a0 \nUnlike  the Tacoma, the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon trucks will be redesigned for  2023, and the Nissan Frontier was just overhauled for 2022. To stay competitive  there will be a new Tacoma soon, but we'll have to keep waiting. That  said, if you're in the market for a midsize truck and can't wait for the next  one, the current highly rated Tacoma is still a compelling choice. For a  thorough review, check out our test team's evaluation of the Tacoma in the  Edmunds' Expert Rating below.\nWhat's  it like to live with?\nWe bought a 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road and lived with  it in our long-term fleet for nearly two years, racking up more than 40,000  miles on the odometer. The Tacoma has received some updates since its redesign  in 2016, but it's the same generation truck and most of our observations apply.  Find out what we thought of everything from its all-around capability to the  tech in our long-term Tacoma test. We  suggest going with the SR5 trim  level if you don't need the added off-road capability of the TRD trims. The SR5  keeps the price down and gives you the choice of both engine options. It also  comes with an 8-inch touchscreen, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a  power-adjustable driver's seat (V6 versions). You also get the choice of a few  optional tech and driver aid packages. How does the Tacoma drive? The Tacoma steers and handles smoothly and is generally easy to drive. The main exception is the brakes, which feel grabby and can induce nosedive in hard stops. We do wish the 3.5-liter V6 felt a bit more willing, but there is enough power for daily use. The transmission shifts predictably and is able to get the most out of the engine.\n\n   Off-road is where the Tacoma truly shines and stands above all others except the Gladiator. The Tacoma has the clearance, gearing and traction to tackle serious terrain, and the brakes and throttle prove brilliantly precise and controllable in low-range crawling situations. How comfortable is the Tacoma? The Tacoma was never a disagreeable truck to ride in, but changes introduced in 2020 made it a little bit more pleasant. A fully adjustable 10-way driver's seat comes standard in V6 trucks, and this seat promotes long-range comfort for drivers of almost all shapes and sizes. \n\n   The thicker side-window glass cuts down the wind noise compared to prior years, though the Colorado and the Ridgeline still have an edge here. The same is true for ride quality since the Tacoma is still truckier than its smoothest-riding competitors. As for the climate system, it has effective heating and cooling and is easy to adjust. How\u2019s the interior? The Tacoma's main drawback is its tallish step-in height. Get past that and everything else is solid once you're inside. The controls are logical and straightforward, including the large infotainment screen and the recently redesigned knobs and physical shortcut buttons. \n\n   The 10-way power seat provides a greater range of adjustability than in pre-2020 models, but we wish the telescoping steering wheel pulled out more. The front seat roominess benefits from the seat's added downward adjustability, but other dimensions remain the same as before. Visibility is very good thanks to the profile of the hood, ample side windows, and a forward- and side-looking camera system. How\u2019s the tech? The latest Tacoma is pretty well stocked with tech features. Toyota introduced a new screen in 2020 that featured a larger size, crisper map graphics and quicker responses than in previous models. You also get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone compatibility and even Amazon Alexa. Built-in navigation is an inexpensive upgrade option, and it's probably worth getting if you're planning on venturing out of cellphone range a lot. \n\n   Toyota's approach to standard active safety tech is admirable. Adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, automatic high-beam control and even a driver drowsiness warning system are all standard on all grades. How are the towing and storage? The Tacoma's truck bed is ideal. It's made of a composite material that needs no bedliner, and it has an enviable combination of fixed and movable tie-downs. Loading is easy because the tailgate opens low and its bedsides aren't comically tall. The Tacoma does lag behind some others with its 6,800-pound maximum tow rating, but the deficit isn't large. \n\n   Interior storage for small items is adequate. Folding the rear seats down into their cargo-carrying position is a little fussy, but as a result it offers better storage space than all but the Ridgeline and the Gladiator. Installing child safety seats is easy, but larger rear-facing and infant seats might eat into front passenger room. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The 3.5-liter V6 engine and six-speed automatic combo earns 20 mpg combined (18 city/22 highway) in 4WD trim and 21 mpg combined in rear-wheel-drive models. Our testing leads us to believe that these ratings are achievable and accurate. \n\n   We tested a 2016 TRD 4WD Off-Road for more than a year and averaged 18.6 mpg over 40,000 miles of use. We were able to exceed the highway rating on several road trips, and there are good reasons why our truck may have come up just over 1 mpg short. Our home-base location skews the mix toward city driving, and the TRD Off-Road has knobbier tires and lacks the front airdam that comes on most Tacomas. Is the Tacoma a good value? You get a lot of well-built truck and a bed with many standard cargo-handling and safety features for your money. The value equation is particularly good on the TRD models. Build quality is solid, and Toyota trucks are known for their mechanical durability. Although warranty coverage isn't generous, you do get two years of free scheduled maintenance. Toyota's Tacoma manages to deliver fun in a right-size pickup package. Its TRD off-road packages are the real deal, not sticker packages inflated by marketing hype. The buying public has responded with fierce loyalty, and this truck has also attracted the attention of the aftermarket, which supports it with many products that enable all sorts of customization. The Tacoma is great for those who want the look and feel of an off-roader even if they'll never get it dirty because it's also an easy-driving and dependable pickup truck.",

    "full_description": "There  are plenty of small SUVs with fuel-efficient hybrid or plug-in hybrid  powertrains, but what if you need something bigger? Three-row midsize SUVs  deliver more capabilities and versatility, but there are only a handful of  hybrids that qualify and the 2023 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is likely the best  candidate for your needs. \nThe Highlander Hybrid is estimated to return up to 36 mpg in  combined city and highway driving, beating the smaller Kia Sorento Hybrid and  larger and more expensive Ford Explorer Hybrid. It's also sensibly priced  compared to the non-hybrid Highlander, making it a smarter pick since you could  conceivably recoup the added hybrid upfront costs within nine months and save  as much as $900 in fuel costs every year after that.\nThe  2023 Highlander Hybrid holds an insurmountable advantage over the Kia Sorento  and Ford Explorer hybrids, but it's not perfect. We cover the good, the  not-so-good and every other topic that's important in our Expert Rating below.  That said, if you're seeking a fuel-sipping three-row SUV, you should start  your search with the Highlander Hybrid. The XLE trim gets our recommendation in  the Highlander lineup. For a reasonable price increase above the base LE, you  get a lot of features such as a sunroof, power-adjustable and heated front  seats, a wireless charging pad and rear sunshades. New for 2023, you also get a  power liftgate. The front-wheel-drive model is a strong value, though if you  live in a foul-weather region, you may want to upgrade to all-wheel drive. How does the Highlander Hybrid drive? The three-row Highlander has the same hybrid powertrain as the RAV4 Hybrid, though Toyota juiced it up a bit to handle the added weight. Our test Highlander accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 8.2 seconds. That's certainly respectable considering some SUVs with V6s take as much time and are far less fuel-efficient. Emergency braking power is also on par. \n\n   Around turns, this hybrid is surprisingly composed. The Highlander Hybrid isn't as athletic as the hybrid version of the Ford Explorer, but handling isn't usually a strong selling point for three-row SUVs. What's more important is ease of driving, and the Highlander Hybrid nails it. Power is readily available and smoothly delivered, and the brakes are smooth and don't exhibit the grabbiness found in some other hybrids. How comfortable is the Highlander Hybrid? The Highlander Hybrid's ride quality is plush. It smooths over most road imperfections yet remains controlled without much float at higher speeds. The wide front seats are pretty comfortable even on long drives, and the available second-row captain's chairs deliver nearly the same level of comfort. Alas, the third-row seats remain one of the Highlander's greatest liabilities. Thin padding, a very low seat cushion and limited legroom make them a no-go for most adults.\n\n   We like the Highlander's excellent climate control system. It's easy to use and can quickly heat or cool the cabin. At highway speeds, the Highlander is nicely insulated from wind and road noise. The gas engine sounds unrefined when you go full throttle, but otherwise it's not intrusive. How\u2019s the interior? The first and second seating rows provide ample space. Unfortunately, the Highlander's third row is one of the most confining by midsize three-row SUV standards. If you're planning on regularly using the full passenger capacity, be sure it meets your needs first. \n\n   Adjusting the driver's seat is quick and easy, and there's ample range of adjustment. Tall drivers will likely want the steering wheel to telescope out a little more. Outward visibility, especially for a vehicle this size, is great. The windshield roof pillars are thin, helping you see around turns or in tight parking situations. \n\n   The Platinum trim, which is what we tested, also comes with some very useful features such as a camera-based rearview mirror that allows you to see out of the back even if you've fully loaded up the rear cargo area. There's also an available surround-view camera system. It has sharp resolution and can be rotated to look around the vehicle. How\u2019s the tech? In recent years, Toyota has trailed other manufacturers when it comes to tech. This latest Highlander Hybrid makes big strides in the right direction, but it still has some minor drawbacks. The optional 12.3-in touchscreen is huge (an 8-inch screen is standard) and it responds quickly to inputs. But its high-gloss surface makes it prone to reflections and smudges. Our Highlander Hybrid Platinum tester had five USB charge ports for the first and second rows but none for the third row.\n\n   All Highlanders come standard with a comprehensive suite of advanced driver aids. We like the natural operation of the adaptive cruise control, but we found the lane departure warning slightly too sensitive and the lane centering ineffective at highway speeds. How\u2019s the storage? Cargo space is a bit of a mixed bag with the Highlander Hybrid. Behind the third row, there's only 16 cubic feet of space, which is a bit less than what the Ford Explorer provides. Behind the second row, it expands to a better-than-average 48.4 cubic feet. The liftover height is about average for a midsize SUV. \n\n   There's decent space for your things, with a few useful shelves across the dash. If you have a phone charging on the wireless pad in the center bin, you have to remove it to access the space beneath. We didn't find it that cumbersome, but you might. \n\n   Got small children? You can easily install a large rear-facing car seat in the second row thanks to the generous amount of fore-and-aft movement of the available captain's chairs. The car seat anchors are also easy to locate and access for all types of seats, though there are no anchors in the third row. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The top trims for the all-wheel-drive Highlander Hybrid get an EPA-estimated 35 mpg combined. Front-wheel-drive versions are a little more efficient at 36 mpg combined.\n\n   On our relatively traffic-free evaluation route, we traveled 115 miles at an efficiency of 33 mpg. That's really good for a big three-row SUV, though it's obviously slightly below the EPA estimates. It's still significantly more efficient than the AWD Ford Explorer Hybrid we tested (EPA estimate: 25 mpg combined), which returned 23.3 mpg on average. Is the Highlander Hybrid a good value? The Highlander's interior is solidly put together with soft, padded surfaces where they matter most. Toyota's hybrids have a track record for running long and strong, so odds are high this Highlander will serve you loyally. There's good value here, too, whether you're cross-shopping against a Ford Explorer Hybrid or even a regular gas-only Highlander.\n\n   Toyota's warranty coverage is pretty common for the class with three years/36,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage and five years/60,000 miles for the powertrain. Hybrid components are covered for eight years/100,000 miles, and the hybrid battery for a generous 10 years/150,000 miles. The first two years of scheduled maintenance are also free. The Highlander Hybrid isn't something we'd choose for a winding road but it's no less composed than the lighter, non-hybrid version of itself. It's something you'd look forward to taking a long trip in, though, and some might consider that fun.\n\n   The Highlander's new styling gives it a more aggressive vibe overall, but we're not sold on the bold details traveling down the side of the car. To us it looks overdone, but to each his or her own.",

    "full_description": "Many  people enjoy poking fun at the Toyota Prius because it's slow, a little  odd-looking and known to be driven by eco-friendly individuals. They don't  understand that the Prius has provided safe, reliable, affordable and practical  transportation for more than 20 years while delivering exemplary fuel economy.  Not many other, if any, vehicles can claim that. With an increasing amount of  competition (which includes the Corolla Hybrid), the Prius has lost some  relevance in the segment it created, but the little oddball will go down in the  history books. \nThe  2022 Toyota Prius Prime is the plug-in hybrid (PHEV) version of the regular  Prius. Toyota adds a charging port and a larger 8.8-kWh battery pack to give  the Prime an EPA-estimated all-electric driving range of up to 25 miles. Once  the electric juice runs out, it becomes a regular hybrid and gets an  EPA-estimated fuel economy rating of 54 mpg combined. Charging the empty  battery to full takes about two hours with a 240-volt charger or five and a  half hours with a 120-volt charger. Essentially, the more frequently you can  plug in and recharge, the less gas you'll use.\nAs  with the regular Prius, the Prime offers a comfortable but otherwise unexciting  driving experience. The hatchback body style offers more cargo space than a  sedan, but because of the larger battery pack, it has a bit smaller cargo area  than the regular Prius. There aren't many plug-in hatchback rivals for the  Prius Prime to compete with, but there is the duo from South Korea: the Hyundai  Ioniq Plug-in Hybrid and the Kia Niro Plug-in Hybrid. For a thorough review by  our test team, check out the Edmunds' Expert Rating below.  Opting  for the midlevel XLE trim is our  recommendation. For not much more than what the base LE trim starts at, the XLE  gets you desirable extras such as simulated leather upholstery, a larger  11.6-inch center touchscreen (versus a 7-inch one), wireless smartphone  charging and a navigation system. How does the Prius Prime drive? You're not buying a Prius Prime for its performance. In Edmunds' testing, our Prius Prime Limited test car accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 10.8 seconds, which is slow no matter how you look at it. Merging onto the highway or passing at higher speeds takes quite a bit of time, throttle and determination. We also tested its emergency braking performance. It stopped from 60 mph in 128 feet, which is slightly below average for a vehicle of this type. The Prime is also pretty tepid when it comes to agility and handling precision. \n\n   On the upside, the Prime has an easy-driving nature and smoothly transitions from EV mode to hybrid gasoline-engine power. And should you do most of your driving in EV mode, you'll find there's adequate acceleration for city traffic. How comfortable is the Prius Prime? The front seats are softly padded and should be comfortable for the long haul. Taller drivers, or those with long legs, might find the seat bottoms to be a few inches too short. The cabin is generally quiet unless you floor the gas pedal, at which point the underpowered engine gets rather raucous.\n\n   Another downside is the Prius' ride quality over broken pavement and concrete expansion joints. The impacts from these types of bumps can make the car feel jittery. Since the car is so quiet, this road noise is more noticeable than it would otherwise be in a non-hybrid. The climate control works well and has clever touches such as the ability to isolate the system in favor of the driver to aid in fuel efficiency. How\u2019s the interior? The Prius is a fundamentally easy car to get into and drive. Aside from the puzzling shifter design, all other controls are immediately familiar. The driver's seat has a wide range of adjustability, but taller drivers will likely want a bit more range of adjustment from the steering wheel. Space up front is expansive. Tall rear passengers will feel a little more cramped because of the Prius' sloping roofline. \n\n   Visibility is a mixed bag. Forward visibility is excellent, but the view over your shoulder is hampered by the thick roof pillars. Some drivers might also not like the view out back because of the split rear window design. The instrument cluster is also quirky because it's mounted in the center of the dash rather than being right in front of you. How\u2019s the tech? Our test Prius Prime had the upgraded 11.6-inch touchscreen display, which is a lot of screen real estate for a car in this price range. Unfortunately, it suffers from cluttered virtual buttons, unsophisticated graphics and clumsy menus \u2014 you'll be fine sticking with the base 7-inch screen. The native voice control system is unintuitive to use too.\n\n   On the upside, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration is standard, and sound quality from the upgraded JBL audio system is better than average. The Prime comes standard with a full suite of advanced driving aids too. Most of them work well, but the adaptive cruise control is very conservative. It's both slow to accelerate and quick to brake for other vehicles. How\u2019s the storage? The Prius Prime's cargo area is compromised due to the larger battery pack, which raises the floor and makes its 19.8 cubic feet behind the rear seats merely adequate. You can always fold the rear seats down if you need more cargo area; just be aware that the load floor isn't flat like it is in a standard Prius. Inside, there's enough in-cabin storage for the daily odds and ends. If you tend to fill your cupholders with personal items, you'll appreciate the large door pockets, which can double as water bottle holders.\n\n   Child safety seats are fairly easy to load in and out of the Prius Prime. LATCH points are easy to find, but the low rear roofline means you might have to stoop quite a bit to get seats and infants in and out. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The Prius is known for its frugality, and the Prime adds the ability to travel an estimated 25 miles on electric power alone. After the battery runs out, you can expect to get 54 mpg in combined city/highway driving. We took our Prius Prime on our standardized evaluation route and traveled 27 miles on electric power and then averaged 63.3 mpg over the remaining miles on the gasoline engine. Both results indicate that the EPA estimates are easily attainable. Is the Prius Prime a good value? Our Limited trim test car stickered for around $35,000 and came with the larger touchscreen, a head-up display (displays important information in your sight line on the windshield), the upgraded audio system and a few additional driver aids. Overall, we think you get an appropriate number of features for your money.\n\n   Even though the Prius' interior feels well built, some cabin materials are a little too plasticky for its price. We're not particularly fond of the shiny plastic trim either \u2014 it tends to collect dirt, scuffs and fingerprints. As for warranties, Toyota gives you its regular coverage, which includes eight years/100,000 miles for the hybrid components. You also get Toyota's two free years of scheduled maintenance, and as a Prime owner, you get roadside assistance for three years. The Prius is not fun to drive, and it's doesn't feel particularly upscale. But it's easy to drive, practical, comfortable in the daily commute, and of course highly fuel-efficient. The Prius has become an icon representing an eco-conscious lifestyle and has defined what you should expect from a fuel-efficient car.\n\n   Should you find fuel economy data entertaining and want to turn the Prius into a first-person driving game to see if you can beat your driving efficiency score, you're likely to find the Prius Prime endlessly entertaining.",

    "full_description": "Toyota's  RAV4 is among the best-selling small SUVs on the market. The appeal is obvious:  It's roomy, comfortable and supported by many shoppers loyal to the Toyota  brand. So what could make this small two-row SUV even better? How about the  2023 RAV4 Hybrid? It's just as practical and enjoyable as the regular model but  gets considerably better fuel economy to boot.  \nFor  the 2023 model year, all RAV4 models receive a upgraded center touchscreen  interface along with a digital instrument cluster. The new system has  better-looking graphics, a more helpful voice command system, and the ability  to receive software updates wirelessly and without a visit to a dealer. There's  also a new Woodland Edition trim that joins the RAV4 Hybrid lineup. Based on  the XLE trim, it features bronze-colored wheels, raised roof rails, all-terrain  tires and a specially tuned suspension that Toyota says is better at absorbing  bumps and ruts. \nThe  two-row RAV4 Hybrid isn't the only efficient SUV in Toyota's arsenal. If you  have a larger family to haul around, check out the three-row Highlander Hybrid.  And for a more electrified driving experience, there is also the RAV4 Prime, a  plug-in hybrid version that has an EV driving range of about 40 miles. We also  recommend checking out the redesigned Honda CR-V Hybrid and the sharply styled  Hyundai Tucson Hybrid. But overall, we think the RAV4 is a smart pick for a fuel-efficient  small SUV.\nPlease note that the following  Expert Rating was conducted on a pre-2023 RAV4 Hybrid. We'll update the score  once we test the RAV4's new touchscreen. We  recommend the XLE Premium trim. It's  the sweet spot in the RAV4 Hybrid lineup thanks to some appealing standard  features such as a sunroof, power liftgate and faux leather upholstery. How does the RAV4 Hybrid drive? Surprisingly swift acceleration, aided by the hybrid's electric power unit, makes the RAV4 Hybrid kind of fun to drive. There's always enough power ready for lively slingshots around traffic, and straight-line sprints are equally entertaining. Our test vehicle did 0-60 mph in 7.8 seconds. That's more than a second quicker than the non-hybrid RAV4 and respectably quick for a small SUV.\n\n   Things are less amusing when stopping \u2014 the brakes feel mushy and devoid of much feedback \u2014 and the same can be said of the steering. Still, the XSE's sport-tuned suspension helps the hybrid stay planted and stable around turns. All RAV4 Hybrids have all-wheel drive. It's not meant for off-roading, but it will definitely help provide more traction on snowy and icy roads. How comfortable is the RAV4 Hybrid? The RAV4 Hybrid can cover long and short distances in pleasant comfort. The XSE trim we tested handled rough patches and bumps with ease without feeling overly firm or harsh. The front seats are nicely sculpted and padded appropriately, but the seat bottoms begin to feel flat on longer drives. The passenger side's lack of adjustment can also make it difficult to find a comfortable position.\n\n   At highway speeds, the RAV4 is generally quiet. The exception is when you hit the gas for a burst of speed, at which point the engine sound gets rather coarse. The climate control system regulates temps quickly and distributes air well throughout the cabin. How\u2019s the interior? It's easy to get in and out of the RAV4 Hybrid's front and back seats, and the roomy cabin gives four adults plenty of space to stretch out. The RAV4 doesn't feel claustrophobic, and there's good visibility in all directions. And while the rear seats are set low, the front seats are oddly high and can't be adjusted down. It can be an issue for taller drivers and front passengers.\n\n   Most controls are logically placed and easy to figure out at a glance. Unfortunately, there's still a long reach to the touchscreen. The tuning knob and buttons on the passenger side of the screen require a reach to use. How\u2019s the tech? Audio and navigation controls are easy to use thanks to a large tablet-style display, but the graphics look pretty dated. The tablet is nothing fancy, but it does the job. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration is standard. It's a good thing too since Toyota's native Entune software remains clunky.\n\n   Voice commands can handle basic phone, audio and navigation functions but require deliberate verbal input. It pays to spend time training the system to learn your voice \u2014 or use Siri or Google Voice instead. The advanced driver aids that come as standard equipment are a huge plus. How\u2019s the storage? The RAV4's cargo hold is nearly the largest in its class, hybrid or otherwise, and the load floor is low and makes loading items easy. The battery pack doesn't consume valuable cargo space, and the RAV4 Hybrid offers the same luggage space (37.5 cubic feet) as its gas counterpart. Tie-down hooks and a 12-volt power outlet enhance the hybrid's utility.\n\n   A small center console and a handful of storage nooks offer space for most small items, although a nifty tray lined with rubber grip spanning the length of the dash makes a good spot to park phones and wallets. Parents with young kids will appreciate the RAV4. It's easy to locate and connect safety seats to the lower car seat anchors. Forward-facing seats and boosters fit readily, but installing a rear-facing infant seat on the passenger side will likely require scooting the front seat up. How\u2019s the fuel economy? You'll have a hard time doing better than the RAV4 Hybrid's EPA rating of 40 mpg combined (41 city/38 highway). That's not only impressive in its own right, but it's also a full 10 mpg better than non-hybrid RAV4 models. We averaged 35.2 mpg during our test, and that was when driving with an often heavy foot. Drive a bit more deliberately and 40 mpg is within realistic reach. Is the RAV4 Hybrid a good value? The RAV4 Hybrid looks and feels well built. Nice tactile touches abound, such as rubberized grips on dials and soft landings for elbows. The optional simulated leather upholstery is soft and pliable.\n\n   The hybrid doesn't cost much more than a non-hybrid, and in return you get better power and fuel economy. It'll actually pay for itself in gas savings during your loan or lease. Toyota's traditional warranty coverage is average, but the hybrid components are covered for eight years/100,000 miles. Free scheduled maintenance for two years/25,000 miles is generous. The RAV4's most recent styling change gives it a tougher look, but there's only so much design aggression you can bake into a crossover. Much of the fun of stabbing the hybrid's throttle for a juicy burst of low-end punch is negated by its rubbery steering, numb braking and droning engine under high load. \n\n   Still, its zippy electrically assisted acceleration, taut suspension and modest off-road capability make the RAV4 Hybrid a solid all-around driver. Toyota has mostly succeeded in taking the bland out of the RAV4.",

    "full_description": "The  Toyota C-HR is a subcompact crossover, or extra-small SUV, designed to combine  the driving experience of a sedan with the raised seating position of an SUV.  It has a coupe-like sloping roofline to accentuate its eye-catching looks, and  it's available in three trims: the LE, XLE and Limited. There are several  vehicles in this style that do a good job of providing easy access with good  fuel economy at an affordable price. Unfortunately, the C-HR is not one of our  favorites. Toyota  first offered the C-HR in 2018. New styling and standard features were added  for the 2020 model year. However, these revisions were not enough to elevate  the C-HR into the upper echelon of our rankings of small SUVs you can buy. The  C-HR is effectively hamstrung by its weak engine, noisy interior and lack of  cargo capacity. It also does not offer all-wheel drive as an option. We  don't expect Toyota to dramatically change the 2022 C-HR. Check out our test  team's Expert Rating to learn more about how the C-HR stacks up against other  extra-small SUVs such as the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Hyundai Kona, Mazda CX-30  and Volkswagen Taos. We  suggest going with the midlevel XLE trim. Compared to the base LE trim, you get keyless entry, blind-spot  monitoring and larger alloy wheels for not much more money. How does the C-HR drive? It's difficult to recommend a vehicle as sluggish as the Toyota C-HR. Its four-cylinder engine simply can't muster enough power to get the C-HR going with any authority. At Edmunds' test track, we logged a 0-60 mph time of 10.6 seconds. That's slower than other small crossovers and hatchbacks. It's even slower than a Toyota Prius.     But the C-HR holds its own in other categories. The brake pedal is easy to modulate, so it's easy to stop smoothly, and the steering is easy to twirl around at low speeds and accurate in sporty situations. The C-HR is also somewhat entertaining to drive on a twisty road even if there's a distinct lack of grip from the tires. How comfortable is the C-HR? The C-HR's seats are well cushioned and supportive, and the suspension smooths out most bumps in the road. The cabin is a pleasant place to be whether you're a driver or passenger.    That said, the C-HR isn't built for less than perfect conditions. We noticed that larger patches of rough pavement can easily upset the ride quality and create a lot of noise in the cabin. It isn't very well insulated from outside noise, and any wind gusts stronger than a light breeze are quite loud inside. How\u2019s the interior? Getting in and out of the C-HR is easy thanks to its elevated seating position. There's also plenty of headroom up front. The rear seats have enough room to keep regular-size adults in decent comfort, but the thick rear roof pillars might make them feel a little claustrophobic.     The C-HR's simple control layout is attractive, and the main controls are easy to operate for the most part. But some of the more advanced features such as the adaptive cruise control are a little more difficult to figure out. It's pretty easy to see out of the front of the C-HR, but those thick rear roof pillars obscure your view to the back. How\u2019s the tech? The C-HR comes with an 8-inch touchscreen that is simple to read and operate through the menus. It connects with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto via smartphones, and an effective navigation system is available. The audio system provides decent clarity, but the sound quality, especially for songs with thumping bass, quickly degrades when the volume rises.    We're fans of the driver safety aids included in the Toyota Safety Sense 2.5 suite, which is standard on all C-HR models. The lane-keeping alert system can be overzealous in its warnings when you're driving on a twisty road, but it's otherwise helpful. The adaptive cruise control is very good at reducing driver fatigue in heavy traffic and can bring the vehicle down to a smooth stop. How\u2019s the storage? Storage space is tight inside the C-HR. Rear trunk space is about average for the class at 19 cubic feet. You can fold down the rear seats to access 37 cubic feet of capacity, but that figure ranks low compared to the competition. Space for small items is adequate up front, though the center console is only average size. The cupholders are on the small side and awkwardly positioned.    Planning to put kids in the back? Car seat anchors are positioned well, but there's little room to install a rear-facing child safety seat without moving the front seats forward. Overall the C-HR is compromised by its quirky shape and size, and Toyota did not bring any of its trademark smart storage solutions to the table. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates fuel economy at 29 mpg combined (27 city/31 highway), which is about average for the class. We found the rating accurate, and even exceeded it with an average of 33.9 mpg on our 115-mile mixed-driving evaluation route. Is the C-HR a good value? The C-HR offers solid build quality and distinctive materials for the class. We also like the amount of standard safety equipment Toyota includes and the two years of free scheduled maintenance. But the C-HR isn't as affordably priced as some value-minded competitors. The distinctive styling alone earns Toyota points for bravery. Most people fall into one of two categories: They love the C-HR's design, or they hate it. Those who like it will find the rest of the vehicle filled with personality, from swooping dashboard lines to interesting trapezoid designs pressed into the ceiling. But just about everyone will find that the lack of power can sour the driving experience.",

    "full_description": "The  2023 Toyota Tundra full-size pickup is coming off a full redesign just last  year. It has significantly more power, capabilities and comfort than the  generation before it, but that shouldn't be too surprising since that  predecessor had been kicking around since 2007. One of the most significant  improvements is the new turbocharged  V6 engine that has about as much power as the old Tundra's V8 but generates  more torque, which is helpful for towing, and boasts considerably better  EPA-estimated fuel economy. There's also an optional hybrid V6  powertrain that gives the  Tundra even more muscle over the standard V6. For  2023, the Tundra's changes are predictably light. So far, it's limited to a new  SX package for the SR5 trim. The SX package gives the Tundra a stealthy look,  with dark gray wheels and body-colored door handles and rear bumper. Given  that, we think the Tundra is an agreeable choice for a light-duty pickup. But  the rival Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 have some advantages that could make them a  better buy. Check out our test team's Expert Rating below for a complete  rundown of the latest Tundra's hits and misses. We  suggest the midrange Limited trim  out of the Tundra's lineup. You not only get a larger infotainment touchscreen  and a smoother ride from hydraulic cab mounts, but it's also the least  expensive way to get the optional hybrid powertrain. How does the Tundra drive? While the loss of the snarling 5.7-liter V8 might cause some concern among the Tundra faithful, the turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 is more than a suitable replacement. There's a substantial amount of torque on tap, even at low rpm, and the 10-speed automatic transmission shifts quickly and smoothly. In our testing, a 4WD Tundra accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 6.6 seconds, which is respectably quick. That power makes it easy to merge with traffic and pass on the open highway without a second thought.    Braking is similarly solid. Our panic-braking test from 60 mph saw the Tundra stop in 131 feet \u2014 that's a bit better than average \u2014 and that was with the TRD Off-Road package's more rugged tires that our test truck had. The light and accurate steering makes it easy to guide the truck down tight backcountry roads and can occasionally feel like the smaller Tacoma.    That TRD Off-Road package that our test truck had includes a locking rear differential and additional off-road driving modes, but it didn't seem to appreciably improve the truck's off-roading capability. This is a big truck and its long wheelbase means the underbody can easily hang up on seemingly easy obstacles. If you're going to hit up any trails in the Tundra, you'll probably want to get the TRD Pro. How comfortable is the Tundra? This Tundra is a marked improvement over the previous generation. Seat comfort and interior noise levels are vastly improved, and the Tundra is a pleasant truck for covering long distances for both front and rear passengers. Though the V6 engine is less sonorous than the previously available V8, under full throttle the V6 sounds appropriately burly for a full-size truck.     The Ram 1500 still rules the class in outright ride quality, but the Tundra offers a fairly buttoned-down and jitter-free ride over most surfaces. The Tundra's straightforward climate control system is largely set it and forget it, but we appreciate the large buttons and dials even if some of the labeling can be tough to decipher in bright sunlight. How\u2019s the interior? While the optional 14-inch touchscreen certainly gets your attention, the Tundra's straightforward interior layout and overall ease of use leave a more lasting impression. Gauges and graphics are easy to read at a glance, and the commanding driving position makes piloting the full-size Tundra much less daunting. Like all full-size trucks, the Tundra offers ample room for all passengers, especially in the CrewMax configuration.     When equipped with the optional panoramic sunroof and unique full-width power rear window, the Tundra feels downright airy and spacious. Even with the Tundra's sizable hood, forward visibility is generally good. But the truck's chunky windshield pillars can easily block your view on two-lane roads. We recommend getting the Tundra's surround-view camera system since it makes maneuvering the truck in tight spots a lot easier. How\u2019s the tech? The Tundra's optional 14-inch touchscreen is a standout feature. It has crisp-looking graphics, and its various onscreen menus are easy to use. In fact, we'd wager some smartphone users might even prefer the native setup to Apple CarPlay or Android Auto (which come standard) for most features. Our test truck had the upgraded JBL audio system, but we found the sound quality from the standard system to be more than adequate.    The Tundra's advanced driver aids, most of which come standard, generally work well. We didn't experience any false alarms in our testing. The only letdown was the lane keeping system, which wasn't particularly useful in keeping this big truck centered between lane markers. How are the towing and storage? The latest Tundra has stout capabilities. Our test truck, with its standard V6 engine and 4WD CrewMax configuration, was rated to tow 11,120 pounds when properly equipped. The Tundra's maximum towing and hauling capacities aren't class-leading, but they're certainly good enough for what most owners will be doing with their trucks. A reinforced composite bed is standard.    The extra space of the CrewMax four-door allows for plenty of storage options in the rear interior for items you'd rather not place in the bed. Rear underseat storage is generous as is small-item storage for front passengers. But the interior storage isn't as well organized in the Tundra as in its domestic counterparts, and we could see the Tundra's various bins becoming a bit messy in a hurry. How\u2019s the fuel economy? Fuel economy isn't usually top of mind for most buyers of full-size trucks, but those interested in the Tundra might want to lower their expectations. The EPA estimates 19 mpg combined for the 4WD Tundra, which is comparable to competitors. However, our test truck clocked a disappointing 15.2 mpg on our real-world evaluation route. And the Tundra managed to achieve only 16.9 mpg during a weekend fishing trip of mostly open-highway driving. That's worse than what we've observed from our testing of other full-size trucks. Is the Tundra a good value? The interior is built to a very high standard. Gaps are tight, and all the various trim elements lined up precisely. Though our Limited trim test Tundra lacked luxury touches such as wood and chrome you find in other midlevel full-size trucks, the Toyota did not feel the least bit downmarket or utilitarian.     Warranties are about average for the class, with three years/36,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage and five years/60,000 miles for the powertrain. But the Tundra's two years/25,000 miles of free maintenance is a slight step above. The Tundra can't claim to be best-in-class when it comes to towing, hauling or ride comfort, but there's nothing wrong with having competence and comfort as primary strengths. This truck is easy to drive and easy to live with, and its available 14-inch touchscreen and full-width power rear window help give it a distinctive driving experience.",

    "full_description": "The  Toyota GR Supra has been on the market for two years now, giving folks time to  adjust to the idea of a Supra with BMW DNA. Yes, the current Supra was born out  of a development partnership between Toyota and BMW, and it uses many BMW  parts. Once you get over that fact, you can enjoy the Supra for what it is: a  sharp-handling sports car that feels as at home on an open stretch of highway  as it does on a winding mountain road.  \nLast  year, Toyota expanded the lineup with the addition of the GR Supra 2.0, a  variant powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. For 2022, the automaker  adds new standard equipment and a limited-production A91-Carbon Fiber edition.  The GR Supra isn't cheap, but it's a performance bargain compared to the  Porsche 718 Cayman, one of the Supra's only direct competitors until the  redesigned 2023 Nissan Z arrives. Check out our detailed Expert Rating to see  how it stacks up against its rivals. The GR Supra 3.0 Premium is the sweet  spot in the lineup. It gets you standard features including full leather  upholstery, an upgraded infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto  smartphone integration, and a premium sound system in addition to the car\u2019s  sonorous turbocharged inline-six. How does the GR Supra drive? The Supras of the past were more about straight-line speed than nimble handling, but this latest incarnation succeeds at both. In Edmunds' testing, our Supra in Premium trim rocketed to 60 mph in a quick 4.4 seconds. A power bump for 2021 makes traction off the line a bit more scarce but improves the Supra's top end by a noticeable margin.\n\n   Around turns, the steering wheel communicates a fair amount of information from the front tires to your hands, and the revised tuning makes it respond more naturally. The revised suspension is also better at retaining grip but feels no less lively, meaning better cornering and less of an immediate tendency to oversteer. The brakes and sticky tires can haul the Supra to a stop from 60 mph in just 105 feet, though for heavier use, like track driving, it would probably benefit from upgraded brake pads. The Supra isn't strictly a weekend car, however. It's something you can drive with little effort every day. How comfortable is the GR Supra? The seats provide excellent support, but you might find them a bit confining around your shoulders. It's not too noticeable when driving at speed, but it's apparent when cruising around. The leather upholstery isn't perforated, so its breathability isn't great. The ride quality is firm but not harsh. Because you sit so close to the rear axle, big vertical movements feel more pronounced.\n\n   We wouldn't call this a quiet cabin since there's a fair amount of road and wind noise, but it's not unpleasantly loud either. It lets in the right amount of induction noise and exhaust burbles when you're driving in Sport mode. As for the climate control system, there's no obvious way to sync its two zones, which is odd. It could stand to be a tick stronger at max fan speed too. How\u2019s the interior? Those familiar with BMW's older iDrive system will feel right at home with the Supra's infotainment. But if you're a first-time user, you'll need to get acquainted with the system's menu layout. All other controls are pretty straightforward. \n\n   The Supra's doors are a little shorter than average and fairly light. Even if you're of average height, you may need to watch your head, but at least the seat bolsters don't impede access. In general, spaciousness is not this car's greatest strength. The Porsche Cayman and BMW M2, for example, do a better job of making a cockpit feel roomy. How\u2019s the tech? The navigation system is pretty good at understanding natural language commands, and it locates specific points of interest without an address. It's easy to use the voice commands to set up your route. Our test Supra had the 12-speaker premium audio system. The audio quality is fine, but it lacks the fullness we'd expect for an upgrade system. As for integration, there's one USB port, an optional wireless charger and wireless Apple CarPlay. Android Auto is now offered.\n\n   The Supra's adaptive cruise control is optional, and it works effectively. It's more aggressive than most systems and can keep a small gap between you and the car ahead if you want it to. It also works all the way down to a stop. Lane keeping assist isn't quite as effective. It'll mitigate lane crossing but doesn't really keep you centered. How\u2019s the storage? Sports cars are usually compromised when it comes to cargo space, and the Supra is no exception. The Supra has less trunk space (10.2 cubic feet) than the Porsche Cayman and the BMW M2. There is a cargo pass-through to the cabin that you can use when hauling longer items. But you'll have to rest those items on the rear-suspension tower brace. \n\n   The small-item storage space is even more deficient in the cabin. The cupholders are located where an armrest bin would typically be. And if you store drinks in them, they will interfere with operating the infotainment system controls. A wireless device charging pad is standard on Premium models and up, but plus-size phones won't really fit in it. The door pockets and glovebox are also small. How\u2019s the fuel economy? Fuel efficiency is not an area we expected the Supra to shine in, but shine it does. It returns an EPA-estimated 25 mpg combined. In our testing, we observed an impressive 29 mpg on our 115-mile evaluation loop. This matches what we observed in a 2020 Supra even though this newer model gains 47 additional horsepower. This also trounces the BMW M2 Competition (20 mpg combined) and even outperforms the base-model Porsche Cayman (24 mpg combined). Is the GR Supra a good value? The Supra's cabin looks more BMW than Toyota, but it's still a pleasant space that delivers a luxury-level look and feel. The carbon-fiber trim that's included in all six-cylinder cars is a nice touch, and it helps make the Supra seem a bit more special than your average coupe. Even if you buy the base-level Supra with the four-cylinder, you're getting a heck of a bargain.\n\n   Toyota's warranty coverage is a trade-off compared to competitors. There's less bumper-to-bumper coverage but better powertrain coverage. Two years of scheduled maintenance is also included. The new Supra mostly delivers on its promises. Sure, there is a lot of obvious BMW DNA here, but that doesn't make it any less of a car if you value performance and swoopy styling. The Supra's appeal is undeniable for the price. It's properly quick and lively, yet it's also mostly comfortable enough to be your daily driver so long as you don't need to take much with you or spend a lot of time on bad roads.",

    "full_description": "Since  its introduction to the U.S. market, way back in 1983, the Toyota Camry has  been one of the most popular and successful sedans in its class. The  latest-generation Camry is roomy, comfortable, sharp-looking and pleasant  \u2014 if not overly exciting \u2014 to drive. It's also one of the  few vehicles in its class to offer all-wheel drive, which is a boon to those  who live in snowy climes but don't want to get behind the wheel of an SUV.  \nThe 2023 Camry marks the sixth year of  production since this generation debuted in 2018. Toyota's sedans and  crossovers generally follow a five-year life cycle, but the 2023 Camry will  soldier on essentially unchanged. The only real upgrade for this year applies  to the SE Nightshade Edition, which sees the 18-inch black wheels replaced by  19-inch bronze-painted alloys.\nNaturally,  there are other options should you not go the Camry route. The Honda Accord  continues to be the Camry's biggest rival, and the Hyundai Sonata and Kia K5  bring plenty of value and style to the table. To see if the Toyota Camry is  worthy of being your next sedan, check out our Expert Rating below.\nWhat's it like to live with?\nWe  bought a 2018 Toyota Camry in the sporty SE trim and tested it for more than a  year. Read our long-term Toyota Camry  test,  where we covered what it was like to live with, from seat comfort to driving  impressions to fuel economy and more. Note that the 2023 Camry differs slightly  from that 2018 model, which did not have Apple CarPlay or Android Auto  smartphone integration, but our general impressions still apply. We  suggest going with the SE trim  level, it offers a pleasing balance of value and performance but doesn't  sacrifice comfort\u00a0 or efficiency. It also  opens up nice-to-have options including a panoramic sunroof and a blind-spot  monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert. How does the Camry drive? We tested the four-cylinder Camry SE. Toyota has optimized it to get high fuel economy, but the trade-off is rather sluggish acceleration off the line. Our test car accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in an unimpressive 8.2 seconds, though it feels a little zestier than that in the real world. The transmission helps make up for this a bit with reasonably good response and quick shifting. With eight speeds, there's always a gear for the occasion, but expect two-gear downshifts when you dip into gas as it tries to make do with the available engine power.\n\n   The Camry SE benefits from a slightly sportier suspension, which lends a more hunkered-down feel. It's not set up for truly aggressive driving, but it'll handle anything the average driver is bound to throw at it on a daily basis. The brakes are also easy to control with a light and responsive pedal, and the Camry's stopping performance is about average for the segment. How comfortable is the Camry? Big, comfortable seats and a smooth ride mean the Camry will suit a wide range of drivers even on long trips. Add in a powerful, easy-to-use climate control system that can cool the cabin effectively, even in triple-digit temperatures, and the Camry provides a pleasant cabin environment for anyone along for the ride. \n\n   Its biggest flaw here is that the Camry lets in too much outside noise. You'll hear a prominent engine buzz when you're accelerating and noticeable wind and road noise at freeway speeds. The Camry is definitely noisier than average for a midsize sedan. How\u2019s the interior? The Camry's cabin won't wow you with its opulence but instead nails the fundamentals across the board. Highlights include an airy cabin that is easy to get in and out of. It's also spacious for both front and rear occupants and has great outward visibility. An optional 360-degree camera system makes it even easier to navigate cramped parking lots.\n\n   The user interface presents no mysteries, with large, clear gauges and simple, well-labeled buttons. They are relatively intuitive even for tech-averse drivers. The radio volume and tuning knobs are small but easy for the driver to reach, though the passenger might have to stretch a bit to use them. How\u2019s the tech? The Camry's smartphone integration includes standard Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa. Both the standard 7-inch and optional 9-inch infotainment touchscreens are easy to read and operate. Built-in navigation is offered on higher trims if you want it. Three USB ports and the option to add a wireless charger should provide plenty of charge for all occupants on the road.\n\n   All Camrys come with Toyota's Safety Sense 2.5+. It's an impressive suite of standard driver assistance features such as adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking and lane keeping assist. Previously, some of these systems have been too sensitive for our liking, but they've been refined for 2021 and work much better. How\u2019s the storage? As midsize sedans go, the Camry's stuff-hauling credentials are pretty solid. The 15.1-cubic-foot trunk area is large for the class. It also has a wide opening with a low liftover height. The 60/40-split back seat is easy to fold down via trunk-mounted release handles if you need to fit longer items. \n\n   There is a good amount of concealed cabin storage too. There's a sliding compartment underneath the wireless charger, a moderately sized center armrest bin, and a small storage cubby on the far left-hand side of the dash. Camry buyers with kids will appreciate the ample backseat room for car seat access and the easily accessible anchors. How\u2019s the fuel economy? The four-cylinder Camry SE's EPA fuel economy rating is among the best in its class at 32 mpg combined (28 city/39 highway). We measured 33.7 mpg on our standardized 115-mile evaluation drive route that provides a mix of city and highway driving. Edmunds also tested a Camry SE of this generation for more than 33,000 miles and observed an average of 29.8 mpg. Is the Camry a good value? The Camry is an easy-to-use, dependable and fuel-efficient vehicle at the expense of some excitement. It isn't as feature-driven as the Hyundai Sonata or as luxurious as the Mazda 6, but its design and variety of textures manage to be attractive without sacrificing functionality.\n\n   Toyota's warranties and after-care support are pretty typical, with three-year/36,000-mile basic and five-year/60,000-mile powertrain coverage. That's nowhere near what Hyundai and Kia offer, but most other brands are in the same boat. The Camry doesn't disappoint, especially in SE trim. It won't replace a real sport sedan, but its pleasing driving dynamics are certainly welcome in this class of car. And with relatively aggressive styling, the Camry at least tries to shrug off the image that midsize sedans don't have to be boring.",
